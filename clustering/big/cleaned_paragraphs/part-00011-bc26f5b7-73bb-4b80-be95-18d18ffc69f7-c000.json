The accompanying text criticizes Gonzalez' Cuban heritage, seeming to reference the Cuban flag patch seen on her sleeve.","\"This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don't speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,\" the post says.","Gonzalez's father fled Fidel Castro's Cuban regime by moving to New York in 1968, according to a Univision profile.

A public apology by Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, on March 22, 2018 failed to quell outrage over the hijacking of personal data from millions of people, as critics demanded the social media giant go much further to protect privacy. (MLADEN ANTONOV/AFP/Getty Images)","Facebook, as we all know, has been hit with yet another public relations crisis, with the company now acknowledging that it allowed data firm Cambridge Analytica to access the private information of 50 million users without their permission. This is just the latest misstep for the company, which, despite being wildly profitable, has been buffeted by negative headlines in recent years, spanning everything from Russian interference in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election to the spate of deadly incidents that were streamed on Facebook Live without detection.","Facebook is far from the only tech behemoth that has faced criticism over the mishandling of data. The European Union fined Google $2.7 billion last summer for manipulating search results to favor its own products, while later in the year Missouri opened an anti-trust investigation into the company, alleging similar misconduct.","Google also had a Russian problem during the election, while its subsidiary YouTube has allowed conspiracy theories born in the dark corners of the internet to spread like a virus. Just hours after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month, the company’s algorithm promoted a video suggesting gun control advocates staged the massacre and paid ‘crisis actors’ to portray students in news interviews.","YouTube eventually removed the video, but the episode highlighted the company’s seeming indifference to fringe elements using its platform to spread disinformation and hate. Terrorist groups, white supremacists and the NRA have all successfully leveraged or manipulated the platform as a useful communications tool.","Through the years, executives from both Facebook and Google have blamed faulty algorithms for many of these problems and repeatedly framed their inability to remove bad actors from their platforms as a necessary evil that comes with promoting the free expression of ideas. Those defenses are mostly public relations nonsense.","All this brings up a question: Is it possible that we have reached \"peak social\"? In other words, with these incidents piling up, does the ongoing global awakening about the wisdom of these firms being trusted to handle data and disseminate information properly have legs? Or will the clamor fade as the news cycle shifts to something else?","On one level, these are preposterous questions. Facebook and Google effectively monopolize the digital ad market. Because of that, both essentially print money, meaning not only are they well-positioned today but are poised to seize control of the segments of the tech industry that will likely power the economy in the decades to come, including driverless cars, the internet of things, artificial intelligence and solar power, either by creating their own offerings or by gobbling up companies that are on the cusp of it.","At the same time, these very strengths (vast wealth and a willingness to spend lavishly) could result in a comeuppance. Investigations into Facebook’s handling of data could lead to a more serious discussion among lawmakers and regulators about whether it makes sense to allow any firm to become as big and powerful, and that would ensnarl another tech heavyweight whose influence has gone unchecked: Amazon.","On top of retail, grocery, cloud computing and entertainment, Amazon now reportedly wants a slice of banking, healthcare and pharmacy. At what point will governments around the world begin to say enough is enough? The current administration may not take action, though it’s nothing if not unpredictable and such a move would fit within the populist economic themes it has embraced.","Meanwhile, something else is happening. With over two billion users, Facebook is beginning to reach full capacity. The is underscored by the fact that daily user growth slowed in the fourth quarter and that the smartphone market is slowing down. With more and more people, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica disclosures, growing uncomfortable being a part of a mass adverting and manipulation network, Facebook reaching a saturation point could come much quicker than any of us realize. For sure, the concept of social media will survive, but perhaps in the future it won't be as centralized as it is today.","In the early 90s, when Microsoft, Dell, Intel and Cisco were at the height of their powers, it seemed like they’d own the future for decades to come. For various reasons, it didn’t happen. More than twenty years later, though, each is still relevant and thriving, though not nearly as dominant as they once were.","Something similar could play out with Google, Facebook and Amazon. Indeed, it’s possible they won’t dominate the world into the next decade, as is the current conventional wisdom.","Ross Gerber is CEO and president of Santa Monica, Calif-based Gerber Kawasaki Inc., a SEC registered investment advisor with approximately $700 million in assets under management.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.","A prominent government watchdog group has filed 30 ethics complaints with various federal agencies — including the White House — alleging that employees are working in violation of President Donald Trump's executive order intended to \"drain the swamp\" and keep government free of former lobbyists.","The complaints, obtained by NBC News, cite Executive Order No. 13770, which effectively barred former lobbyists from being appointed, without a waiver, to governmental positions in which they would manage issues they'd lobbied on within the past two years.","Last summer, Public Citizen identified 36 lobbyists who'd been tapped for government jobs dealing with issues they'd lobbied on, and only six of those appointees have received waivers since then, the group said.","\"These 30 apparent violations of Trump's own ethics rules are only the tip of the iceberg,\" said Craig Holman, co-author of the June 2017 report and lobbyist for Public Citizen's Congress Watch division.","Holman added that the Trump administration had issued the waivers only to appointees whose apparent violations had received attention and scrutiny through media reports.","One individual cited by Public Citizen was Byron Anderson, a special assistant to the secretary of labor, who the group said \"appears to be working on the same specific issue areas he had lobbied on within the last two years, and has not received a waiver from the ethics rules.\" According to Anderson's LinkedIn profile, he worked as a vice president of federal affairs at Transamerica until January 2017.","The group also filed complaints citing employees at the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Health and Human Services, Commerce, Interior, Energy, Education, Agriculture, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Office of Management and Budget.","Public Citizen has sent the complaints to ethics officers at each agency where the appointees are working, requesting that they investigate.","The White House has not responded to a request for comment.","\"The bottom line is that neither Trump nor his administration take conflicts of interest and ethics seriously,\" said Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs for Public Citizen. \"'Drain the swamp' was far more campaign rhetoric than a commitment to ethics, and the widespread lack of compliance and enforcement of Trump's ethics executive order shows that ethics do not matter in the Trump administration.\"","Many of the president's Cabinet heads and aides have routinely raised legal and ethical questions. For example, former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned after just eight months on the job amid a public outcry over his use of private jets to conduct government business, which cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.

But the data came from someone who didn’t hack the system: a professor who originally told Facebook he wanted it for academic purposes.","He set up a personality quiz using tools that let people log in with their Facebook accounts, then asked them to sign over access to their friend lists and likes before using the app. The 270,000 users of that app and their friend networks opened up private data on 50 million people, according to the New York Times. All of that was allowed under Facebook’s rules, until the professor handed the information off to a third party.","Facebook said it found out about Cambridge Analytica’s access in 2015, after which it had the firm certify that it deleted the data. On Friday, Facebook said it now knows Cambridge actually kept it -- an infraction that got Cambridge suspended from the social network. Once that was announced, executives quickly moved on to defending Facebook’s security.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,’’ longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth said on Twitter. “People chose to share their data with third-party apps and if those third-party apps did not follow the agreements with us/users it is a violation.’’ Alex Stamos, Facebook’s head of security, echoed the same arguments. Cambridge denied doing anything illegal or using the information in the 2016 presidential election; Facebook says it has no way of knowing how or whether the data was used for targeting in the Trump campaign.","Facebook’s advertising business depends on users sharing their most personal data via its social network. But the company’s “not a breach” argument isn’t likely to make users feel any safer or more comfortable doing so -- especially given that it’s already under fire for missing that Russian actors were purchasing U.S. election ads on the site to sway voter opinions, as well as running fake accounts disguised as real Americans. The company has also been fending off accusations that it’s too slow to notice or react to harmful content.","U.K. Inquiry","The latest incident has raised new questions about what technical guardrails Facebook has in place to prevent authorized users from sharing sensitive information, and how much visibility the company has into how outsiders use the data.","Facebook wouldn’t comment on those questions, saying only that it has made significant improvements in its ability to “detect and prevent violations” by app developers, such as random audits of applications using its tools to make sure they’re following the rules. And it’s no longer letting developers who use Facebook’s login tools see information on their users’ friends.","The disclosure of Facebook’s actions also underscores it’s continuing struggle to anticipate negative consequences of its lack of oversight – in some cases taking action only after things go wrong. The company in the past two years has worked to understand and counteract the spread of misinformation on its site, the use of its automated advertising system for racist targeting, the proliferation of fake user accounts, the spread of violent video, and more.","But when the company tries to explain what it’s doing, it grapples with the perception that it’s shirking responsibility for its problems, treating them as public-relations snafus instead of serious product flaws.","Stamos, the Facebook security executive, deleted his original tweets on Cambridge Analytica, saying he wasn’t so good at “talking about these things in the reality of 2018.” Specifically, he said he didn’t know how to balance his personal beliefs with his responsibility to Facebook and his co-workers, amid all the criticism.","“We have collectively been too optimistic about what we build and our impact on the world,” Stamos wrote Saturday on Twitter. “Believe it or not, a lot of the people at these companies, from the interns to the CEOs, agree.”","Lawmakers in the U.S. and U.K. aren’t convinced Facebook has its users’ best interests in mind. Over the weekend the company faced critiques from members of the Senate intelligence committee, and in London, the head of a parliamentary committee called on CEO Mark Zuckerberg to have a senior executive answer those questions.","“We have repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular whether data had been taken from people without their consent,” Damian Collins, chair of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee, said in a statement. “Their answers have consistently understated this risk, and have also been misleading to the committee.”","To contact the reporter on this story: Sarah Frier in San Francisco at sfrier1@bloomberg.net.","To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Steve Geimann, Andras Gergely"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Facebook pointed out that all those users had agreed to the tracking on an opt-in screen. In other words, Facebook took advantage of the fact nearly everyone clicks on things without reading them.","Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg didn’t really apologize for Cambridge Analytica getting unauthorized access to Facebook data through a quiz application; he called it “a breach of trust.” But this time, Facebook says it did nothing wrong. Let’s take apart its statement. I’ve added a translation.","Fact Check: Your Call and SMS History","You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission.","This is not the case.","Translation: We did this call- and text-logging on purpose.","Opt-in features in Facebook Lite and Messenger","Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.","Translation: If you don’t like this, it’s your fault. We asked you and you said yes. Don’t you remember agreeing to it?","We introduced this feature for Android users a couple of years ago. Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and services as a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with. This was first introduced in Messenger in 2015, and later offered as an option in Facebook Lite, a lightweight version of Facebook for Android.","Translation: Lots of apps import contact lists — everybody’s doing it. Of course, we did more than import contacts, we imported information about every phone call and text you sent. Isn’t that almost the same thing?","How it works","When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history. For Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose ‘learn more’ or ‘not now’. On Facebook Lite, the options are to turn it on or ‘skip’. If you chose to turn this feature on, we will begin to continuously log this information, which can be downloaded at any time using the Download Your Information tool.","Translation: We wrote “Text anyone in your phone” which sounds like what everyone does when texting. But if you read the light grey print, you’ll see something about uploading info, not just about your contacts’ phone numbers, but about “your call and text history.” Gotcha!","If, at any point, you no longer wish to continuously upload this information, you can easily turn this feature off in your settings. You can also turn off continuous call and text history logging while keeping contact uploading enabled. You can also go to this page to see which contacts you have uploaded from Messenger, and you can delete all contact information you’ve uploaded from that app should you choose.","Translation: Once you figure out that we’re tracking everything you do, you can wade into our privacy settings and turn it off. But be aware: many who have entered that deep, dark privacy forest have never returned.","We never sell this data, and this feature does not collect the content of your text messages or calls","When this feature is enabled, uploading your contacts also allows us to use information like when a call or text was made or received. This feature does not collect the content of your calls or text messages. Your information is securely stored and we do not sell this information to third parties. You are always in control of the information you share with Facebook.","Translation: It could be worse. We could be listening to your calls and reading your texts.","Opt-ins are going to bite all of us","Facebook is right. Every person whose calls and texts they logged opted in. Then why are those people so upset?","Because those people don’t remember agreeing to get their calls and texts tracked.","Or because they do remember, but thought they were only giving access to the contact list, not information about every call and text.","“Opt-in” means you have to agree. But it’s easy to click, and hard to read and understand everything you click on. (Really, when was the last time your read the “terms of service” for something before clicking on it? Sure, you do that every single time, right?)","Applications like this are going to be more common. So are opt-ins that fly by in a hurry but open you up, not just to sharing data, but to financial liability. (The Boston Globe wrote a story this week about the tricky “free trials” that have resulted in surprising recurring monthly charges on people’s credit cards.)","I see three possible outcomes.","Let the buyer beware. This is the user’s problem.","Create regulation. Insist on clearer warnings for opt-in pages.","The online industry self-regulates and develops its own standards for clearer opt-ins for data sharing and credit-card charges.","Which approach do you think is best?","Related","I publish a blog post this interesting every single weekday. Sign up. It's worth it, really.","I enjoy your editorial bits woven through. But don’t call it “translation.” “Interpretation” seems more accurate, since you give a cynic’s coloration.

On Monday, a UK television program aired undercover footage of Alexander Nix, the company’s CEO, boasting about how it could use spies, entrapment techniques, and fake news to influence elections. Britain’s information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said she would seek a court order to look at Cambridge Analytica’s servers and databases.","The same day, Facebook said it had hired forensic auditors to examine whether Cambridge Analytica had held on to data allegedly passed to it by an academic at Cambridge University, Aleksandr Kogan, who gained access to Facebook’s platform for research purposes several years ago. Kogan, who used that access to glean information about 50 million Facebook users, was also blocked from the platform, as was Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower.","The post-mortem into the affair, and how the data were used in Cambridge Analytica’s efforts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential election, is in full swing. It will add to the turmoil at Facebook, which lost $37 billion in market cap during the day's trading and may also lose Alex Stamos, its chief security officer, who has reportedly clashed with the network’s leadership over how transparent Facebook should be about Russia’s use of the platform to spread disinformation.","One really important question is whether all this could harm researchers’ efforts to shed more light on the immense influence that social networks now have over our lives. To explore the issue, we spoke with Sinan Aral, a social-media expert who is a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management.","Were you surprised that a researcher could access so much data and allegedly pass it to a third party in violation of Facebook’s data use rules?","I wasn’t surprised they could access that much data. Facebook’s been pursuing research questions with qualified researchers for some time. What is surprising is that an academic researcher could so flagrantly violate the spirit and the terms of the data-sharing policies Facebook has in place by taking that data and giving it to a firm that was never authorized to have it in the first place for the purposes of political targeting.","Are you very concerned that this episode could have a chilling effect on social networks’ willingness to share data with researchers?","Yes, I am. Facebook is facing what I call a “transparency paradox.” On the one hand, it’s under tremendous pressure to be more transparent, to reveal more about how targeted advertising works; how its News Feed algorithms work; how its trending algorithms work; and how Russia or anyone else can spread propaganda and false news on the network. So there’s this very strong pressure to be more transparent and to share data with trusted third parties. But on the other hand, there’s really strong pressure to increase the security of the data that they do reveal to make sure that it doesn’t get into the wrong hands and to protect users’ privacy.","This transparency paradox is at the core of Facebook’s existential crisis today, and there’s a real risk that the Cambridge Analytica story will make it more conservative in what it shares, which would affect the research of hundreds of good scientists who are working with the social network every day without breaching its terms of service in order to understand how Facebook is affecting our society.","Is the current ad hoc process for giving researchers access to social-network data governed by nondisclosure agreements working well, or could it be improved?","I think each request needs to be individually vetted by Facebook and other networks. I wouldn’t want them to give blanket access to just certain narrow kinds of data. There are a lot of different aspects of Facebook that are important to understand, and it needs to be able to consider the costs and benefits of each proposed data release.","One suggestion that’s been floated is to create a portal where registered researchers could query anonymized data from social-network users who have consented to share their information. What do you think of that idea?","That kind of portal could be useful, but it’s only one very small solution to the transparency paradox. There needs to be much more openness than just a single set of data. There need to be lots of different ways that Facebook and other networks work with the scientific community to help us all understand how social media is affecting our democracy, our businesses, and our public health.","Is the Cambridge Analytica story a signal that we should be more broadly concerned about the power of these platforms and what they are doing with our data?","I think the story is about a researcher who flagrantly violated the likely terms of any data-sharing agreement he had with Facebook for research purposes and the company, Cambridge Analytica, that either knowingly or unknowingly used the data for potentially nefarious purposes without vetting the source of that data and any restrictions associated with it. That’s the real story here.","We need to better understand the threat of bad actors who may use access to data to help them spread fake news or propaganda on social platforms. And the only way we’re going to get a handle on that is if Facebook can find a way to resolve its transparency paradox effectively by becoming more open and more secure at the same time.","The AI revolution is here.

Reporting by the Observer, the Guardian and the New York Times in recent days has revealed that Cambridge Analytica — the social media monitoring firm that bragged it helped put Trump in the White House — had gained access before the election to the data of 50 million Facebook users through highly questionable means. Cambridge Analytica used to that data to create a tool of “psychological warfare” to manipulate American voters with targeted Facebook ads and social media campaigns. This news has painted the national discussion over social media’s impact on national politics in a stark new light. There was already a debate raging about how targeted digital ads and messages from campaigns, partisan propagandists and even Russian agents were sowing outrage and division in the U.S. electorate. Now it appears that Cambridge Analytica took it one step farther, using highly sensitive personal data taken from Facebook users without their knowledge to manipulate them into supporting Donald Trump. This scandal raises major questions about how this could have happened, how it can be stopped and whether the connection between data-driven ads and democracy is fundamentally toxic.","The bombshells are dropping so fast in this story about social media and the 2016 election, it is hard to keep up. Recall that just last week, Washington was aflutter over allegations from Brad Parscale, head of digital media strategy for President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential run and the man who led the partnership with Cambridge Analytica, who tweeted on February 24 that his boss’ campaign had a massive advantage using Facebook advertising to reach voters. Parscale, who is now chief of Trump’s 2020 efforts, said his candidate’s Facebook ads were 100 or 200 times more cost-effective than those placed by the Clinton campaign for the presidency. Facebook quickly shared proprietary data illustrating that the two campaigns paid roughly the same aggregate sums to reach voters — and that the Trump campaign actually paid more on average than the Clinton campaign.","Now in light of the Cambridge Analytica headlines, it is clear that price of the advertising wasn’t the real story. The real story is about how personal data from social media is being used by companies to manipulate voters and distort democratic discourse. In this regard, it appears the Trump campaign had a decisive and ill-gotten advantage in the quest to exploit personal data to influence voters. And they used it to the hilt.","This is all very alarming. And as the days follow and the details are parsed about how this happened and who is to blame for malign social media advertising, we should not lose sight of a more basic question. As they stand, are the ways that social media sites use personal data to sell and publish political ads good for democracy in the first place?","On the internet, you don’t know much about the political ads you’re shown. You often don’t know who is creating them, since the disclaimers are so small, if they exist at all. You also don’t really know who else is seeing them. Sure, you can share a political ad — thus fulfilling the advertiser’s hopes — and then at least some other people you know will have witnessed the same ad. But you don’t really know if your neighbor has seen it, let alone someone else across the state or the country. In addition, digital advertising companies distribute ads based on how likely you are to interact with them. This most often means that they send you ads they think you are likeliest to engage with. They don’t determine what the nature of that engaging content might be — but they know (just as all advertisers do) that content works well if it makes you very emotional. An ad like that doesn’t make you contemplative or curious, it makes you elated, excited, sad or angry. It could make you so angry, in fact, that you’ll share it and make others angry — which in turn gives the ad free publicity, effectively making the advertiser’s purchase cheaper per viewer, since they pay for the initial outreach and not the shares. (This last bit is precisely what made Parscale proud.)","What this can lead to is communities and, eventually, a nation infuriated by things others don’t know about. The information that makes us angriest becomes the information least likely to be questioned. We wind up stewing over things that, by design, few others can correct, engage with or learn from. A Jeffersonian public square where lots of viewpoints go to mingle, debate and compromise, this is not.","The reason you don’t know about all of these things is the same reason that we as citizens should be worried: the whole system operates in the darkness of proprietary data and algorithmic processes at internet companies. Unless they tell us how they use the data they collect about us and design their targeting algorithms, we can only guess.","It’s important to distinguish what is new about this process. There are similarities here to the world of broadcast political ads — which itself is a cesspool. If a campaign produces a profoundly noxious ad, it might get some extra coverage in the news about how the ad was especially outrageous, meaning more people see it but at no additional cost. But producing and buying airtime for a TV ad is a lot more expensive and reaches a lot fewer people than if a political organization can make a toxic ad go viral on Facebook, Twitter or YouTube and reach millions of people. Plus, when that organization does this on TV, it is transparent to everyone what it’s doing because the ad is on TV, and the organization is required by law to put its name on the ad and survive regulatory scrutiny. If a political organization does the same thing on a social media platform, it is, again, only visible to the people you targeted and those they share it with. And labels showing who bought the ad are often not all that they could be. (The companies say they are fixing this — and if they don’t, then regulation probably will compel it.)","TV stations also don’t have nearly as much detailed information about what makes their viewers react. But social media sites do. This gives political groups and campaigns incredible power — and is the secret sauce of the Internet advertising business, since it also proffers commercial advertisers the same ability. Here’s how it works.","First, the campaign collects as many email addresses from as many places as possible from potential supporters. Sometimes they take the voter file itself (the public list of all registered voters) and use data-mining techniques to match names and home addresses with email addresses. Next, the campaign uploads that massive list of email addresses into a social media service. Facebook, for example, can match the email addresses to individual users to create a “Custom Audience.” This is where Cambridge Analytica had a huge advantage, since they had the private Facebook data themselves and did not need to rely on guesswork to match email addresses and Facebook pages to actual voters. This audience can then be sliced and diced into different demographic groups, right down to people’s political and cultural preferences and biases. Here again, Cambridge Analytica may well have used their own private data stash to figure out ways to target specific voters with specific messages by studying their past behavior on Facebook. These filtered groups can then be tested to see which people respond well to which messages. From there, Facebook has another tool called “Lookalike Audiences” — as do other sites – that will find people that are similar to those designated in any given slice of the Custom Audience. Then the campaign buys ads that deliver the messages that Facebook data confirms people want to hear — turning up the outrage and sensation factor to get attention (ideally for free).","All of this does not add up to sites like Facebook and Twitter intentionally undermining Hillary Clinton. It is simply the nature of ad tech and social media: use personal data to divide up classes of the American population like barn animals, then feed us highly personalized messages designed to push our particular buttons so well that we share them and they go viral, thus keeping people on the site longer. Social media rewards provocation — again, without repercussion, since we usually only share content with our friends in a way that is largely invisible to the broader public. Morality and integrity count little in online advertising.","The real question here isn’t which campaign got the advantage. The real question is whether this micro-targeted free-for-all should be allowed in the political sphere at all in the way it is currently designed —with very little transparency about who is pulling these strings and how they are doing it.","When Russian trolls used social media to manipulate the voting public — apparently even more cost-effectively than the Trump campaign — it triggered a national scandal along with demands that the social media companies be held accountable for letting it happen. But when our own political parties do this to us, we often turn a blind eye. It’s politics as usual. Perhaps it is time to reconsider how and when we should set appropriate restrictions on the use of social media for political communications, especially as another set of national elections is just around the corner.","Beyond basic commitments to assure the privacy and security of their personal data, voters have a right to know who is trying to send them political messages and how they are doing it. They should know who bought the ads, how much they spent and what particular demographic audiences were targeted. They should be able to look at all the ads run by the people trying to reach them. This should not be a database available somewhere on the Internet that normal users would never visit. It should be pushed forward as a part of the ad, so that it is easy to click and see the data right there. Beyond that, social media sites should take action against any political communicator that tries to break the rules. Facebook has responded to the Cambridge Analytica story to say that the technique used to extract data from 50 million users is no longer allowed. But no one is sure exactly what types of sensitive personal data are already out there or who possesses them — making it likely that efforts at voter exploitation will continue. For this reason, the companies should continue to develop better algorithmic detection systems to discover attempts to mislead prospective voters and act against them before or soon after they are disseminated.","But the American public must be wary, since the drive toward total transparency is unlikely to come from the politicians currently in power — or the tech companies themselves, even after they adopt some laudable measures. If there is anything we should learn from the Cambridge Analytica revelations, it is that unless things change, we can expect the spread of disinformation and the systemic manipulation of voters to happen all over again, not only in U.S. national elections but throughout the world. Because if there’s one thing everyone can agree on, it’s that these tools are effective.","IDEAS","TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.

His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.","After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn’t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.","That was inspiring to me.","It wasn't long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.","But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the “silent majority” of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite. So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.","I don't think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.","He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver's seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy.","Ignoring the fact that at the time Trump tweeted this (time-stamped 4:37 p.m.) the latest news reports had already placed the number differently at 70 dead, 300 injured, take a moment to appreciate the ridiculous, cartoonish, almost childish arrogance of saying that he alone can solve. Does Trump think that he is making a cameo on Wrestlemania (yes, one of his actual credits)?","This is not how foreign policy works. For anyone. Ever.","Superhero powers where \"I alone can solve\" problems are not real. They do not exist for Batman, for Superman, for Wrestlemania and definitely not for Donald Trump.","What was once Trump's desire to rank second place to send a message to America and to increase his power as a businessman has nightmarishly morphed into a charade that is poised to do irreparable damage to this country if we do not stop this campaign in its tracks.","I'll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now.","You can give Trump the biggest gift possible if you are a Trump supporter: stop supporting him.","He doesn't want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could have run the White House. He’s achieved that already and then some. If there is any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate succeed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.","The hard truth is: Trump only cares about Trump.","And if you are one of the disaffected voters — one of the silent majority like me — who wanted a candidate who could be your voice, I want to speak directly to you as one of his biggest advocates and supporters.","He is not that voice. He is not your voice. He is only Trump's voice.","Trump is about Trump. Not one of his many wives. Not one of his many \"pieces of ass.\" He is, at heart, a self-preservationist.","In fact, many people are not aware of the Trump campaign's internal slogan, but I will tell you. It is stolen from a make-believe television presidency on The West Wing where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet. The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartlet's staff was “Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.”","Inside the Trump camp, the slogan became \"Let Trump Be Trump.\"","It is a repurposed slogan that seemed spot-on for the candidate. He is an intelligent, charismatic man who is involved in every aspect of his organization and would rather speak from the cuff than read briefing notes and recite them. I, in fact, admire Trump for this. But saying this qualifies him to be president is like saying that Seth Rogen is suited to be president. Another extraordinary improvisor, not an extraordinary presidential candidate.","Trump has undoubtedly lived up to the slogan, right down to his main public-relations liaison. Rather than go for a focus-group Washington insider, his communications person had previously taken press calls for the Trump Organization and directed them to the appropriate Trump child. She joked that before joining the campaign she thought \"Common Core\" was a class at Equinox.","The primary problem with this? What I've seen the longer I've helped prop him up along with the millions who are helping Trump is that we got the slogan wrong. A more accurate internal slogan would read, \"Let Trump Help Trump.\"","I don't dismiss any single Trump constituent, which is why I believe it's important to let you know that the candidate does.","I, too, think our country has gone off track in its values. I, too, think that we need a dramatic change of course. But I am, in my heart, a policy wonk and a believer in coming to the table with necessary knowledge for leading the free world.","The man does not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not know — the most frightening position of all.","I remember watching the second Trump debate and thinking, After this, he is going to have to start hammering it home on policy; the country needs substance to make an informed decision.","I wished for it six months ago and am still waiting for it today. He had an opportunity after the terror attacks in Belgium and instead he used the opportunity to talk about closing the borders and what a mess that country had become. I was appalled that he offered no condolences or words of support; he merely gave his \"build a wall\" stump speech and talked about his greatness.","I felt sad for him at that moment.","And now, with the latest horrifying terror attack in Pakistan, my sadness has turned into anger.","I consider myself a part of the silent majority that led to Trump’s rise, which is why I want you to know that I am with you — I wanted Trump to be real, too.","The problem with characters is they are the stuff of soap operas and sitcoms and reality competitions — not political legacies.","Trump made me believe. Until I woke up.","And he has no problem abusing your support the same way he cheated hard-working men and women out of millions of dollars, for which he is now being sued.","I came into this eager to support a savvy businessman who received little outside funding. I loved Trump's outsider status. But a year has now passed since I was first approached to become part of Team Trump.","While the pundits pontificated about what type of PR stunt Trump had up his billion-dollar sleeves, I met with people who convinced me he was serious about changing the political conversation. I wanted to raise millions for him. I wanted to contribute to millions of votes.","And as part of that support, in October, I supported the internal decision to close the Super PAC in order to position him as the quintessential non-politician. I still supported him with great passion after that. The decision to close the Super PAC was part of that devotion to his message of outsider change.","But something was shifting.","Without intending to do so, I began to hear and evaluate him more critically and skeptically as a member of the voting public rather than a communications person charged with protecting his positions.","I no longer felt that he was the leader the country was looking for, and I found myself longing — aching, really — for policy substance that went beyond building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. What were once bold — although controversial — statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.","And here's what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.","Because we are all angry — and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.","Unfortunately, the more vitriolic Trump has become, the more the people responded to him. That drove him to push the boundaries further and further.","I also started seeing a trend of incompetence and deniability.","When there was a tweet that contained an error, he would blame it on an intern; when there was a photo containing a World War II Nazi Germany background, he would blame it on an intern; when he answered questions in an overtly controversial fashion, he would claim that he did not properly hear the question. He refused to take responsibility for his actions while frequently demanding apologies from others.","Imagine Trump wronged you, even in the smallest possible way. He would go to the grave denying he had ever done anything wrong to you — ever.","Trump acts as if he's a fictional character. But like Hercules, Donald Trump is a work of fiction.","No matter how many times he repeats it, Trump would not be the \"best\" at being a president, being in shape, fighting terrorism, selling steaks, and whatever other \"best\" claim he has made in the last 15 minutes.","He would be the best at something, though. He is the best at looking out for Donald Trump — at all costs."],"isopubdate":"2053-12-12"}

The changes are largely cosmetic, but visual cues, such as a consent interface that encourages users to opt-in to data collection, can make a big difference. Recent consumer outrage has underscored how Facebook’s troubling privacy practices were hidden in the fine print and buried deep in its privacy settings.","As part of Wednesday’s privacy changes, Facebook redesigned its settings menu on mobile devices so that privacy options are available in a single place, rather than spread out across nearly 20 different screens. Facebook will also let users download more of their information than before, so they can see and manage the personal data they’ve shared with Facebook (including new categories such as likes, comments, reactions, search history, and location history), and transfer it to another service, if they choose.","Facebook","Facebook also introduced a new tool called Access Your Information, which allows users to access and delete posts, reactions, comments, and search history.","Facebook","“The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data. We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed,” Erin Egan, vice president and chief privacy officer of policy, and Ashlie Beringer, vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote in a company blog post. The executives stressed that these changes had been in the works for awhile, in addition to privacy improvements that CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised last week, like making it easier for users to revoke access to third parties.","Zuckerberg has faced a maelstrom of criticism following reports that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica misused the personal data of millions of Facebook users. This weekend, Zuckerberg took out a full page ad in major newspapers in the US and UK apologizing for the “breach of trust.” Around the same time, reports surfaced that Facebook had been scraping call and text message data from Android users for years. The company assured irate users that they had opted in to the feature, though some complained they had not realized it.","But Facebook has another major motivator to clean up its privacy act. In May, a new consumer-centric privacy law will go into effect in the European Union called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which severely restricts the collection of personal data and demands increased transparency about how personal data is shared and why it is collected. Violators can face fines of up to 4 percent annual global revenue, which for Facebook could reach as high as $1.6 billion.","In January, Facebook said it would launch a privacy dashboard as part of its GDPR compliance efforts, and today’s announcement is part of that effort. Facebook promised more changes in the coming weeks, including updates to both its terms of service and its data policy, making them more transparent about what data is collected and how that data is used. “These updates are about transparency—not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” the executives wrote in Wednesday’s post."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Facebook disclosed the issue in a blog post on Friday, hours before media reports that conservative-leaning Cambridge Analytica, a data company known for its work on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was given access to the data and may not have deleted it. The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which was already under attack over Russians’ alleged use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U.S. elections. “It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves,” Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar tweeted. “They say ‘trust us.’ Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary,” she added, referring to Facebook’s CEO and a committee she sits on. Facebook said the root of the problem was that researchers and Cambridge Analytica lied to it and abused its policies, but critics on Saturday threw blame at Facebook as well, demanding answers on behalf of users and calling for new regulation. Facebook insisted the data was misused but not stolen, because users gave permission, sparking a debate about what constitutes a hack that must be disclosed to customers. “The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who… [Read full story]"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape.

Cambridge Analytica, the data firm he worked with – which funded the project to turn tens of millions of Facebook profiles into a unique political weapon – also attracted interest from a key Russian firm with links to the Kremlin.","Energy firm Lukoil, which is now on the US sanctions list and has been used as a vehicle of government influence, saw a presentation on the firm’s work in 2014. It began with a focus on voter suppression in Nigeria, and Cambridge Analytica also discussed “micro-targeting” individuals on social media during elections.","The revelations come at a time of intense US scrutiny of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, with 13 Russians criminally charged last month with interfering to help Donald Trump.","In Britain, concerns about Russian propaganda have been mounting, with the prime minister, Theresa May, recently attacking Russia for spreading fake news, accusing Moscow of attempts to “weaponise information” and influence polls.","Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, discussed with Cambridge Analytica the data company’s powerful social media marketing system, which was already being deployed for Republican Ted Cruz in the US presidential primaries and was later used to back Brexit and Trump.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, emailed colleagues after initial contacts to say that Lukoil wanted a clearer explanation of “how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business”.","“They understand behavioural micro-targeting in the context of elections (as per your excellent document/white paper) but they are failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers,” he wrote in an email seen by the Observer.","A slide presentation prepared for the Lukoil pitch focuses first on election disruption strategies used by Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, in Nigeria. They are presented under the heading “Election: Inoculation”, a military term used in “psychological operations” and disinformation campaigns. Other SCL documents show that the material shared with Lukoil included posters and videos apparently aimed at alarming or demoralising voters, including warnings of violence and fraud.","Discussion of services offered by Cambridge Analytica was apparently going right to the top of Lukoil, even though its retail operations in America are a very minor corner of the oil and gas giant’s empire. Asking for a detailed presentation of Cambridge Analyticas’s work in July 2014, Nix told his colleague the document would be “shared with the CEO of the business”.","The chief executive of Lukoil, Vagit Alekperov, is a former Soviet oil minister who has said the strategic aims of Lukoil are closely aligned with those of Russia. “I have only one task connected with politics, to help the country and the company. I’m not close to Mr Putin, but I treat him with great respect,” he told the New York Times.","Cambridge Analytica said an affiliate company had talked to Lukoil Turkey about a loyalty card scheme and proposed a pilot study with a small number of petrol stations there, but the project had not gone ahead. “[The talks] were about potential commercial work in Turkey and did not involve any discussion of political work,” a spokesman said. “Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate companies have not worked in Russia and have not worked for a Russian company or organisation.”","Last month Nix told MPs: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do no have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”","That appears to contradict the company documents seen by the Observer, that list Russia as one of the countries where Cambridge Analytica and affiliate companies have clients.","Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who has come forward to talk to the Observer, said it was never entirely clear what the Russian firm hoped to get from the operation.","“Alexander Nix’s presentation didn’t make any sense to me,” said Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica soon after the initial meetings. “If this was a commercial deal, why were they so interested in our political targeting?”","Lukoil did not respond to requests for comments.","Kogan, a lecturer who worked with Cambridge Analytica on building up the database of US voters then at the heart of the company’s plans, said he had not had any connection to the Lukoil pitch.","But while he was helping turn Facebook profiles into a political tool he was also an associate professor at St Petersburg State University, taking Russian government grants to fund other research into social media. “Stress, health, and psychological wellbeing in social networks: cross-cultural investigation” was the title of one piece of research. Online posts showed Kogan lecturing in Russian. One talk was called: “New methods of communication as an effective political instrument”.","Cambridge University said academics are allowed to take on outside work but are expected to inform their head of institution, a rule Kogan had complied with. “We understand that Dr Kogan informed his head of department of discussions with St Petersburg University regarding a collaboration; it was understood that this work and any associated grants would be in a private capacity,” a spokesman said.","Apart from that, Kogan appears to have largely kept the work private. Colleagues said they had not heard about the post in St Petersburg. “I am very surprised by that. No one knew,” one academic who asked not to be named told the Observer. Russia is not mentioned in a 10-page CV Kogan posted on a university website in 2015. The CV lists undergraduate prizes and grants of a few thousand dollars and links to dozens of media interviews.","One Cambridge Analytica employee mentioned Kogan’s Russian work in an email to Nix in March 2014 discussing a pitch to a Caribbean nation for a security contract, including “criminal psychographic profiling via intercepts”.","“We may want to either loop in or find out a bit more about the interesting work Alex Kogan has been doing for the Russians and see how/if it applies,” the colleague wrote.","Kogan told the Observer: “Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way. No data or models.” His recollection was that the Russia project had started a year after his collaboration with Cambridge Analytica ended.","He said the St Petersburg position emerged by chance on a social visit. A native Russian speaker, Kogan was born in Moldova and brought up in Moscow until he was seven, when his family emigrated to the US, where he later obtained citizenship.","However, he stayed in touch with family friends in Russia and visited regularly.

Facebook declined immediate comment.","In a tweet, Stamos did not deny he was leaving but said: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook.

He and other company leaders stressed that Facebook aspires to be an “open platform,” according to one source who attended the meeting and described it as productive.","Story Continued Below","But the roster of high-profile conservatives in the room — including right-wing media star Glenn Beck and a top aide to Donald Trump — still relayed to Zuckerberg their “frustrations” on an array of issues, from Facebook’s guidelines for reviewing news stories to how it handles content related to guns or the tea party, which they said often ends up being diminished or banned.","There’s a “perception among conservatives that Facebook is a liberal organization that conservatives can’t trust, and they seem genuinely interested in changing that,” said Rob Bluey, The Heritage Foundation's vice president of publishing, who attended the meeting.","\"It was really a give and take between political and technical and how these works are colliding,\" said David Bozell, son of Brent Bozell and executive director of online activist organization ForAmerica. \"It was very friendly very personable,\" he added.","Zuckerberg himself sought to drive home that point and defend his company in a Facebook post shortly after the meeting concluded.","“The reality is, conservatives and Republicans have always been an important part of Facebook,” he wrote. Donald Trump has more fans on Facebook than any other presidential candidate. And Fox News drives more interactions on its Facebook page than any other news outlet in the world. It’s not even close.”","“Still, I know many conservatives don’t trust that our platform surfaces content without a political bias,” Zuckerberg added. “I wanted to hear their concerns personally and have an open conversation about how we can build trust. I want to do everything I can to make sure our teams uphold the integrity of our products.”","Representing Facebook along with Zuckerberg were Sheryl Sandberg, the company’s chief operating officer and longtime backer of the Democratic Party, and Peter Thiel, the investor, Facebook board member and a recently named delegate for Trump at the GOP convention.","Conservative political and media figures attending the session included Barry Bennett, a top adviser to Trump; Beck, the television and radio commentator who owns The Blaze; Zac Moffatt, a digital adviser to Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign; former Republican Sen. Jim DeMint, the leader of The Heritage Foundation; and Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute.","Fox News contributor Dana Perino and CNN contributor S.E. Cupp also joined. Other guests included Alex Skatell, founder and CEO of the Independent Journal Review; Jonathan Garthwaite, general manager of conservative websites including HotAir; Mary Katherine Ham, editor at large of HotAir; Tucker Carlson, founder of The Daily Caller; Jennifer Braceras, a columnist at the Boston Herald; Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots; Kristen Soltis Anderson, a columnist and pollster; and Brent Bozell, founder and president of the Media Research Center.","“Facebook has a serious problem,” Bozell said in a statement issued before the meeting. “Trust is everything and now conservatives don’t trust them. My hope is that today’s meeting will begin to put concerns to rest.”","One prominent outlet, however, dismissed Facebook’s overture before the meeting even began: The conservative news site Breitbart lambasted Zuckerberg for holding what amounted to a “photo op.”","Some conservatives criticized the fact that the Zuckerberg meeting was private, even though Facebook convened it to emphasize its commitment to transparency. Reporters weren’t permitted to attend, and Facebook didn’t livestream any portion of the proceedings online.","“Facebook puts a lot of pressure [on users] to be transparent, to be social, to be open to be using video,” said Vincent Harris, a top GOP strategist, in an interview earlier this week. Stressing that the company could be “using their wonderful new Facebook Live feature,” he added, “Why are we having a closed door meeting about this?”","Hoping to further court the company’s newest skeptics, Facebook on Wednesday also offered the visiting conservatives a deep dive into how its news gathering works and a roughly hourlong tour of the company’s sprawling campus. And it even gave them the chance to try some of its technology, such as its virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift, according to schedule details obtained by POLITICO.","Afterward, some attendees described the meeting as positive: Cupp, from CNN, tweeted the group heard “strong commitments to address issues, as well as to work together on common goals.”","Since last week’s Gizmodo report, Facebook has taken flak from the Republican National Committee, which accused the company of “conservative censorship,” and from the Senate Commerce Committee, which pressed the social network to detail its news publishing practices. (Trump, who has used social media to fuel his presidential campaign, has yet to weigh in publicly.)","As it has scrambled to contain the political damage, Facebook has strongly rebutted the allegations while insisting that it is a neutral news platform — even as it has disclosed a previously unrevealed level of human intervention in the selection of stories for the “Trending” feature. The company over the past week has published its editorial guidelines, promised to answer lawmakers' questions and methodically reached out to the RNC and other Republican organizations as it tries to preserve its crucial D.C. relationships.","Complicating the dispute is Zuckerberg’s history of liberal-leaning stances, including his push for immigration reform, his support for same-sex marriage and Facebook’s decision earlier this year to ban gun sales on its site. But the company has also tried in recent years to bolster its conservative ties, including hiring former George W. Bush adviser Joel Kaplan as its global public policy director.","This year, it is also participating in both the Republican and Democratic national conventions, despite calls by liberal activists for companies to boycott the GOP gathering because of Trump's remarks about women and minorities — and Zuckerberg’s own opposition to the Republican front-runner’s policy positions."],"isopubdate":"2016-05-18"}

To some extent, they also apply to the venue profiles and events.","1. ADDING NEW ARTISTS TO OUR DATABASE","1.1. General rules for ADDING Artists:","• When submitting a new artist, you have to include one of 2 mandatory links (FACEBOOK, SPOTIFY) plus one other link to social media channels in order for the submission to be accepted","• Submissions can be written in any language, we only ask that you use latin alphabet, especially for names.","• Submitting artists that are either inactive or deceased is forbidden, therefore submissions will be denied.","• Content on any channel you add should not be older than 2 years (exceptions are SONGKICK, BEATPORT, ITUNES, SHAZAM).","• All channels must have CONTENT on it (exception is BANDSINTOWN — if without content it must be verified!).","• Links leading to empty channels will result in denial of your submission.","• URLs must start with http://, URLs for FACEBOOK, TWITTER, SOUNDCLOUD, YOUTUBE, SONGKICK, INSTAGRAM, and SPOTIFY must start with https://","1.2. Specific rules for ADDING Artists:","• Spotify profiles must be artist profiles, user profiles will be denied (https://open.spotify.com/user/...).• Homepage: official homepages are the best option here, but you can also use Bandcamp, Blogspot, Wordpress, and Wix pages as homepages. It is forbidden to add Reverbnation and Myspace pages as homepages. Do not link other social media channels here.• Facebook: must be a page, not a (personal or group) profile. We accept only legit or verified pages, all fan pages will be denied.• Twitter: we’ll accept legit or verified twitter accounts, all fan pages will be denied.• Soundcloud: make sure it’s not a fan-generated profile. Adding a profile that has only previews of tracks will be denied.• YouTube: make sure it’s not an auto-generated profile (topic). You can add either VEVO or OFFICIAL channel — choose strongest (in the following order: more subscribers, more videos uploaded, more views of those videos). • Google+: do not add community profiles, only user profiles will be accepted. Make sure the account is legit or verified. Fan accounts will be denied.• Beatport: only submit links that start with https://www.beatport.com/artist/umek/4177. Don’t submit dj.beatport links, as they will be denied.• Mixcloud: only link legit accounts with actual content. We only accept links in the following form: https://www.mixcloud.com/dj_umek/• Songkick: make sure the account is legit or verified and has at least one event (upcoming or past) listed.• Bandsintown: we accept verified accounts or accounts with at least one event listed on the profile. Empty ones must be verified in order to be accepted.• iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/artist/umek/80110059. This is what we’d like our iTunes links to look like. Don’t add links to specific albums or tracks.• Instagram: make sure it’s not a fan-generated Instagram profile before submitting the link. We accept private and open profiles.• Shazam: it has to be a legit or verified account.• Tumblr: make sure it’s not fan-generated profile.• Gigatools: make sure it matches the artist’s name and contains at least 5 (past or upcoming) events.","This is a personal Facebook profile, we will reject these.","2. SUGGESTING CHANGES TO EXISTING ARTIST PROFILES","2.1. General rules for CHANGES:","When suggesting a link or URL changes to existing artist profiles, follow the same rules that apply for adding artists.Furthermore you need to understand that when you propose a change in a profile and we accept that change — all statistics for that channel on artist profile is reset. So have in mind that you can ruin your favorite band statistics if you make reckless changes!","2.2. Specific rules for CHANGES:","• Do not replace existing links with ones that have different URL, but lead to the same channel (YouTube channel links are the most common example here).• Do not replace http:// with https:// unless you are the artist and you will claim your profile.• Do not make changes for inactive or dead users — but DO NOTIFY us of such a case! We are dealing with thousands of entries a day so we can not follow artists activities but will gladly remove them once notified!","3. ADDING VENUES","VENUE NAME: always use official VENUE name (write it in the latin alphabet!) — one that is used in other official channels.VENUE ADDRESS: when adding new VENUES to our database make sure we can locate them on GOOGLE MAPS — always put in the foundable address (sometimes Venue can be found by its name so you can also put in a name of the venue as the address!).CAPACITY TYPE: when deciding about the type of Venue, consider official information found on Venues official channels. If there is no such information try alternatives (google search).CAPACITY RANGE: if there is no official information about capacity range, try alternatives (google search) or try to determine the capacity range from photos of Venue or its location.LINKS: there are no mandatory links for adding new venues to our database, but we’d appreciate it if you could add links to at least some channels, to ease the workload of our curating team.","4. SUGGESTING CHANGES TO VENUES","When suggesting changes to existing venues, please follow the guidelines that apply to artists.","5. ADDING EVENTS","When it comes to events, you can only add them to our database. You can’t curate existing ones.","Event will be denied if:","• Event is already in our database• Date of the Event is wrong• Line up is incorrect or incomplete• You provided insufficient information about the venue• You have chosen wrong Venue from the drop-down list• We were not able to determine the existence of the event (based on provided information)","There are THREE ways to add EVENTS:","1. You can add events in the main menu in the upper-right corner (+ADD).2. Directly on an ARTIST profile (when you add them from an artist profile, the artist will be automatically added to the line-up).3. Directly on VENUE profile (when you add them from venue profiles, the venue will be added automatically).","5.1. Rules for ADDING Events","EVENT NAME: must be written in a specific form: EVENT NAME at VENUE NAME (always use the official name of the event, if there is none put artists names in)TICKET LINK: is not mandatory, but it is very useful because it helps us establish whether Event is real (it will take place at the provided venue at a given time with the provided lineup).EVENT DATE: must be correct. When adding festivals, choose the start of the festival as the event date.EVENT LINEUP: put in the complete lineup! If the particular artist is not in our database we will consider your lineup as correct. When it comes to festivals — put in the complete lineup for all days under one event! (Festivals are particularly tricky since lineups often change, so you need to put in at least 60% of the artists).VENUE: you must always check if a Venue is already in our database — if it is, you must choose it from the dropdown list. If a Venue is not in our database please provide sufficient information about Venue name and ADDRESS. Without sufficient information, your entry will be denied!","If you encounter any problems or have questions, you can always reach us at support@viberate.com or info@viberate.com"],"isopubdate":"2017-12-04"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and former Trump senior adviser Stephen Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of the investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said that Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked, as well as some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Kogan and Cambridge, and Wylie, that the information he had shared had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to Facebook that they had done so. But Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" the company said. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.\"","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collections have been criticized by other researchers. \"Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows.

One article I want to point you towards is Lance Weiler’s “Virtual Discovery.” It looks at some of the ways that creators are building audiences by embracing collaborative models of marketing and even production. Weiler also discusses the importance of data portability — the ability for filmmakers to take the aggregated info about their audiences from online platform to online platform. Why is this important?","From the piece:","The real strength of data portability for filmmakers is not just in making their own audiences portable but in allowing these audiences to make the films themselves portable and social. In the not-so-distant future media social graphs will be created allowing film content to benefit fully from the promise of the Long Tail.","Relationships to films will seamlessly flow from one film to the next once the connections can be made in a simple fashion that moves beyond a basic IMDb or Google search. Visualizing the connections between films and allowing them to be spread across blogs, sites and social networking pages could produce media social graphs that link actors, shooting locations, genres, or musical references across multiple films. However in many cases these connections will be guided by an infinite number of nuances, referenced and generated by an audience that has a desire to discover, share and engage with the media they care about — references built upon core elements such as what a person likes and dislikes, watches or reviews, comments on, or personally recommends.","Or maybe it will be things that connect people in personal ways, like where they first met or how they felt at a particular moment in time. This is nothing new. The mind has been making these connections around music and films for years. A certain combination of musical notes or a crisp line of dialog will immediately trigger a memory from one‘s life. But it is such personalization of media in the online space that will fuel the next generation of distributed social networking as well as a number of new discovery and distribution business models in the process.","Another valuable aspect of this media social graph will be a layer that enables point of purchase to ride in close proximity to any reference to the media. For example, links to purchase digital downloads, DVDs or even to book tickets for an upcoming screening will accompany these social graphs.","Check out the piece online (or, even better, pick up the magazine on the stands), and then, when you are finished reading it, head over to The Workbook Project because Weiler has posted three of his “This Conference is Being Recorded” podcasts with the key interviewees in the article. Here, Larry Lessig talks about the “hybrid economy” detailed in his new Remix book. At this link Chris Saad discusses his Data Portability Project. And over here you can listen to Justin Ouellette talk about his Muxtape music discovery site.","And, for another take on issues related to online audience building, visit this blog tomorrow — I’ll be running a short interview with Tommy Pallotta in which he discusses his decision to leave Facebook."],"isopubdate":""}

Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends.

His statement, which acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes in responding to the situation, wasn’t much of an apology—Zuckerberg and Facebook have repeatedly demonstrated they seem to have a hard time saying they’re sorry.","For me, Zuckerberg’s statement fell short in a very specific way: He’s treating the Cambridge Analytica breach as a bad-actor problem when it’s actually a known bug.","In the 17-months-long conversation Americans have been having about social media’s effects on democracy, two distinct sets of problems have emerged. The ones getting the most attention are bad-actor problems—where someone breaks the rules and manipulates a social-media system for their own nefarious ends. Macedonian teenagers create sensational and false content to profit from online ad sales. Disinformation experts plan rallies and counterrallies, calling Americans into the streets to scream at each other. Botnets amplify posts and hashtags, building the appearance of momentum behind online campaigns like #releasethememo. Such problems are the charismatic megafauna of social-media dysfunction. They’re fascinating to watch and fun to study—who wouldn’t be intrigued by the team of Russians in St. Petersburg who pretended to be Black Lives Matter activists and anti-Clinton fanatics in order to add chaos to the presidential election in the United States? Charismatic megafauna may be the things that attract all the attention—when really there are smaller organisms, some invisible to the naked eye, that can dramatically shift the health of an entire ecosystem.","Known bugs are the set of problems with social media that aren’t the result of Russian agents, enterprising Macedonians, or even Steve Bannon, but seem to simply come with the territory of building a social network. People are mean online, and bullying, harassment, and mob behavior make online spaces unusable for many people. People tend to get stuck in cocoons of unchallenging, ideologically compatible information online, whether these are “filter bubbles\" created by algorithms, or simply echo chambers built through homophily and people’s friendships with “birds of a feather.” Conspiracy theories thrive online, and searching for information can quickly lead to extreme and disturbing content.","The Cambridge Analytica breach is a known bug in two senses. Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University researcher who built a quiz to collect data on tens of millions of people, didn’t break into Facebook’s servers and steal data. He used the Facebook Graph API, which until April 2015 allowed people to build apps that harvested data both from people who chose to use the app, and from their Facebook friends. As the media scholar Jonathan Albright put it, “The ability to obtain unusually rich info about users’ friends—is due to the design and functionality of Facebook’s Graph API. Importantly, the vast majority of problems that have arisen as a result of this integration were meant to be ‘features, not bugs.’”","In his non-apology, Zuckerberg claimed Facebook had already taken the most “important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people’s information.” But changing the API Kogan used to collect this data is only a small part of a much bigger story.","To be clear, I believe Kogan acted unethically in allegedly collecting this data in the first place, and that giving this data to Cambridge Analytica was an unforgivable breach of research ethics. But Kogan was able to do this because Facebook made it possible, not just for him, but for anyone building apps using the Graph API. When Kogan claims he’s being made a scapegoat by both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, he has a strong case: Selling data to Cambridge Analytica is wrong, sure, but Facebook knew that people like Kogan could access the data of millions of users. That’s precisely the functionality Facebook advertised to app developers.","Speaking with Laurie Segall on CNN this week, Zuckerberg emphasized that Facebook would investigate other app makers to see if anyone else was selling psychographic data they’ve collected through the Graph API. But Zuck didn’t mention that Facebook’s business model is based on collecting this demographic and psychographic information and selling the ability to target ads to people using this data about them.","This is a known bug not just for Facebook and other social networks, but for the vast majority of the contemporary web. Like Facebook, Google develops profiles of its users, with information from people’s private searches and tools like Gmail and office applications, to help advertisers target messages to them. As you read this article on The Atlantic, roughly three dozen ad trackers are watching you, adding your interest in this story to profiles they maintain on your online behavior. (If you want to know more about who’s watching you, download Ghostery, a browser extension that tracks and can block these “third-party” trackers.) The Atlantic is not unusual. Most ad-supported websites track their users, as part of agreements that seek to make their ad inventory more valuable.","I’ve referred to this bargain, in which people get content and services for free in exchange for having persuasive messages psychographically targeted to them, as the “original sin” of the internet. It’s a dangerous and socially corrosive business model that puts internet users under constant surveillance and continually pulls our attention from the tasks we want to do online toward the people paying to hijack our attention. It’s a terrible model that survives only because we haven’t found another way to reliably support most internet content and services—including getting individuals to pay for the things they claim to value.","We become aware of how uncomfortable this model is when Steve Bannon and Cambridge Analytica develop personality profiles of us so they can tailor persuasive messages to our specific personal quirks, but that’s exactly what any competent advertiser is doing, every day, on nearly every site online. If that makes you feel uncomfortable: Good, it should. But the problem is way bigger than Facebook. This is a known bug not just with social networks, but with the contemporary, ad-supported web as a whole.","It’s relatively easy for social networks to address bad-actor problems. For the most part, social networks would be better off without bots artificially promoting posts or fabricated news capturing clicks. Platform interests are aligned with society’s interests as a whole in fighting bad actors.","It’s different with known bugs.","When platforms address them, they run the risk of breaking their business models. It’s hard for YouTube to fix a recommendation engine that leads us toward conspiracy-theory videos without breaking a system that encourages us to surf from one popular video to the next, racking up ad views in the process. It’s hard—though not impossible—to fix harassment and bullying on Twitter when many of Twitter’s most engaged users are opinionated and sharp-tongued and their arguments are some of the most compelling content on the service. And it’s impossible for Facebook to protect us from manipulative advertising targeted to our psychographic profile when their business model is built on selling this particular form of persuasion.","Platforms won’t fix known bugs on their own, not without external pressure. In his interview with Segall, Zuckerberg acknowledged that it might be time for regulation of Facebook, suggesting standards that force transparency around who’s paying for ads. We should push Facebook, and the web as a whole, to do much more to address this known bug, and others.","Users of the internet have been forced into a bargain they had no hand in negotiating: You get the services you want, and platforms get the data they need. We need the right to opt out of this bargain, paying for services like Facebook or YouTube in exchange for verifiable assurances that our usage isn’t being tracked and that our behavioral data is not being sold. We need an ecosystem that encourages competitors to existing social-media platforms, which means ensuring a right to export data from existing social networks and new software that lets us experiment with new services while maintaining contacts on existing ones. We need to treat personally identifiable information less like a resource to be exploited and more like toxic waste, which must be carefully managed, as Maciej Ceglowski has proposed. This may require a digital EPA, as Franklin Foer, Paul Ford, and others have argued—a prospect that would be more appealing if the actual EPA wasn’t currently being gutted.","Critically, we need the scholars, philanthropists, and policy makers who’ve woken up to the problems of bad actors on the internet to pay attention to the known bugs as well. Addressing the effects of echo chambers, polarization, and psychographic persuasion may not be as sexy as unmasking Russian botnets, but the botnets are a merely a symptom of a much larger problem.","Tribalism, manipulation, and misinformation are well-established forces in American politics, all predating the web. But something fundamental has changed. Never before have we had the technological infrastructure to support the weaponization of emotion on a global scale. The people who built this infrastructure have a moral obligation to own up to what they’ve done. On some level, in some way, Zuckerberg must know that. “We have a responsibility to protect your data,” he said in his statement, “and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you.” Nor does he deserve our support if he and his peers don’t address the known bugs that are corroding democracy.","We want to hear what you think about this article.

{"originalurl":"http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/BBKI75r?ocid=st","title":"Feds prohibit candidates from commenting on Trump, despite constitutional questions","text":["It's yet another example of the crazy and complex federal campaign finance laws. Worse, it shows how the federal government has unconstitutionally inserted itself into state governance.","The Federal Election Commission recently released two enforcement matters concerning the federal gag on state candidates. In one matter, Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee's 2016 reelection campaign ran a TV ad tying his Republican opponent to Trump. The ad concluded, \"Bill Bryant and Donald Trump, Wrong for Washington [State].\" Hillary Clinton and Inslee went on to clobber their opponents in that state. Going in the opposite direction, gubernatorial candidate Eric Greitens sent a mailer urging Missouri voters to turn out for Trump and Greitens. Trump went on to win a conversely large margin in that state, while Greitens won by a narrower margin.","The Inslee and Greitens ads seem rather typical for political campaigns, but they were actually outlawed by Congress in 2002 as part of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA). Among other things, that law prohibits state candidates from sponsoring any ad that \"promotes or supports\" or \"attacks or opposes\" a federal candidate unless they use so-called \"federal funds.\" \"Federal funds,\" in turn mean donations within the federal contribution limits, source prohibitions, and reporting requirements.","The vast majority of states have contribution limits for gubernatorial candidates that are higher than the federal limits, or have no limits at all. Twenty states also permit contributions beyond the federal limits for state legislative candidates. Corporate contributions, which are prohibited under federal law, also are permitted in a majority of states. State and local candidates also file their campaign finance reports with state and local authorities, and therefore do not comply with the federal reporting requirements. In short, all or virtually all state and local candidates run using non-federal funds, and therefore are prohibited by BCRA from discussing federal elected officials in their campaign ads.","BCRA's gag rule on state and local candidates was a dumb idea when passed. Now, it's likely unconstitutional as well. In 2003, the Supreme Court upheld the law based on a \"prediction ... that state and local candidates and officeholders will become the next conduits for the soft-money funding\" of federal campaign ads. At the time, BCRA had banned non-federal funds (a.k.a. \"soft money\") from being used to pay for any campaign ads regarding federal candidates.","In other words, the Supreme Court upheld this provision based on a mere conjecture, and a far-fetched one at that. After all, how many state candidates would allow their own campaign funds to be used to campaign for another candidate running for federal office? To the extent state candidates like Inslee and Greitens invoke the names of federal candidates, they're trying to win their own races. That's the well-known \"coattails effect.\"","The Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision shredded the rationale for this gag law. Today, contribution limits no longer apply to independent speech by advocacy groups and super PACs about federal races. Therefore, there isn't any reason for donors seeking to influence federal races to use state candidates as \"conduits\" to evade the federal contribution limits - not that this had ever been likely.","So now state candidates find themselves in a tough spot. If they want to attack or praise Trump, who has declared he is a candidate in 2020, they will be violating federal campaign finance laws. While state candidates must keep their mouths shut, independent groups may support or oppose federal candidates as much as they want.","When Congress passed BCRA, critics complained that it federalized state election activities. They were right. Indeed, 16 years later, state and local party committees struggle under the law's burdens, even as the Supreme Court tossed out the law's other key provisions. As the 2018 elections unfold, many state and local candidates also will unwittingly run afoul of the federal law, and pressure will mount for a constitutional challenge."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The BBC was “another beauty”.","That night I did two things. First, I typed “Trump” in the search box of Twitter. My feed was reporting that he was crazy, a lunatic, a raving madman. But that wasn’t how it was playing out elsewhere. The results produced a stream of “Go Donald!!!!”, and “You show ’em!!!” There were star-spangled banner emojis and thumbs-up emojis and clips of Trump laying into the “FAKE news MSM liars!”","Trump had spoken, and his audience had heard him. Then I did what I’ve been doing for two and a half months now. I Googled “mainstream media is…” And there it was. Google’s autocomplete suggestions: “mainstream media is… dead, dying, fake news, fake, finished”. Is it dead, I wonder? Has FAKE news won? Are we now the FAKE news? Is the mainstream media – we, us, I – dying?","I click Google’s first suggested link. It leads to a website called CNSnews.com and an article: “The Mainstream media are dead.” They’re dead, I learn, because they – we, I – “cannot be trusted”. How had it, an obscure site I’d never heard of, dominated Google’s search algorithm on the topic? In the “About us” tab, I learn CNSnews is owned by the Media Research Center, which a click later I learn is “America’s media watchdog”, an organisation that claims an “unwavering commitment to neutralising leftwing bias in the news, media and popular culture”.","Another couple of clicks and I discover that it receives a large bulk of its funding – more than $10m in the past decade – from a single source, the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. If you follow US politics you may recognise the name. Robert Mercer is the money behind Donald Trump. But then, I will come to learn, Robert Mercer is the money behind an awful lot of things. He was Trump’s single biggest donor. Mercer started backing Ted Cruz, but when he fell out of the presidential race he threw his money – $13.5m of it – behind the Trump campaign.","It’s money he’s made as a result of his career as a brilliant but reclusive computer scientist. He started his career at IBM, where he made what the Association for Computational Linguistics called “revolutionary” breakthroughs in language processing – a science that went on to be key in developing today’s AI – and later became joint CEO of Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund that makes its money by using algorithms to model and trade on the financial markets.","One of its funds, Medallion, which manages only its employees’ money, is the most successful in the world – generating $55bn so far. And since 2010, Mercer has donated $45m to different political campaigns – all Republican – and another $50m to non-profits – all rightwing, ultra-conservative. This is a billionaire who is, as billionaires are wont, trying to reshape the world according to his personal beliefs.","Robert Mercer very rarely speaks in public and never to journalists, so to gauge his beliefs you have to look at where he channels his money: a series of yachts, all called Sea Owl; a $2.9m model train set; climate change denial (he funds a climate change denial thinktank, the Heartland Institute); and what is maybe the ultimate rich man’s plaything – the disruption of the mainstream media. In this he is helped by his close associate Steve Bannon, Trump’s campaign manager and now chief strategist. The money he gives to the Media Research Center, with its mission of correcting “liberal bias” is just one of his media plays. There are other bigger, and even more deliberate strategies, and shining brightly, the star at the centre of the Mercer media galaxy, is Breitbart.","It was $10m of Mercer’s money that enabled Bannon to fund Breitbart – a rightwing news site, set up with the express intention of being a Huffington Post for the right. It has launched the careers of Milo Yiannopoulos and his like, regularly hosts antisemitic and Islamophobic views, and is currently being boycotted by more than 1,000 brands after an activist campaign. It has been phenomenally successful: the 29th most popular site in America with 2bn page views a year. It’s bigger than its inspiration, the Huffington Post, bigger, even, than PornHub. It’s the biggest political site on Facebook. The biggest on Twitter.","Prominent rightwing journalist Andrew Breitbart, who founded the site but died in 2012, told Bannon that they had “to take back the culture”. And, arguably, they have, though American culture is only the start of it. In 2014, Bannon launched Breitbart London, telling the New York Times it was specifically timed ahead of the UK’s forthcoming election. It was, he said, the latest front “in our current cultural and political war”. France and Germany are next.","A determined plutocrat and a brilliant media strategist can, and have, found a way to mould journalism to their own ends","But there was another reason why I recognised Robert Mercer’s name: because of his connection to Cambridge Analytica, a small data analytics company. He is reported to have a $10m stake in the company, which was spun out of a bigger British company called SCL Group. It specialises in “election management strategies” and “messaging and information operations”, refined over 25 years in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. In military circles this is known as “psyops” – psychological operations. (Mass propaganda that works by acting on people’s emotions.)","Cambridge Analytica worked for the Trump campaign and, so I’d read, the Leave campaign. When Mercer supported Cruz, Cambridge Analytica worked with Cruz. When Robert Mercer started supporting Trump, Cambridge Analytica came too. And where Mercer’s money is, Steve Bannon is usually close by: it was reported that until recently he had a seat on the board.","Last December, I wrote about Cambridge Analytica in a piece about how Google’s search results on certain subjects were being dominated by rightwing and extremist sites. Jonathan Albright, a professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, who had mapped the news ecosystem and found millions of links between rightwing sites “strangling” the mainstream media, told me that trackers from sites like Breitbart could also be used by companies like Cambridge Analytica to follow people around the web and then, via Facebook, target them with ads.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica makes the astonishing boast that it has psychological profiles based on 5,000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters – its USP is to use this data to understand people’s deepest emotions and then target them accordingly. The system, according to Albright, amounted to a “propaganda machine”.","A few weeks later, the Observer received a letter. Cambridge Analytica was not employed by the Leave campaign, it said. Cambridge Analytica “is a US company based in the US. It hasn’t worked in British politics.”","Which is how, earlier this week, I ended up in a Pret a Manger near Westminster with Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s affable communications director, looking at snapshots of Donald Trump on his phone. It was Wigmore who orchestrated Nigel Farage’s trip to Trump Tower – the PR coup that saw him become the first foreign politician to meet the president elect.","Wigmore scrolls through the snaps on his phone. “That’s the one I took,” he says pointing at the now globally famous photo of Farage and Trump in front of his golden elevator door giving the thumbs-up sign. Wigmore was one of the “bad boys of Brexit” – a term coined by Arron Banks, the Bristol-based businessman who was Leave.EU’s co-founder.","Cambridge Analytica had worked for them, he said. It had taught them how to build profiles, how to target people and how to scoop up masses of data from people’s Facebook profiles. A video on YouTube shows one of Cambridge Analytica’s and SCL’s employees, Brittany Kaiser, sitting on the panel at Leave.EU’s launch event.","Facebook was the key to the entire campaign, Wigmore explained. A Facebook ‘like’, he said, was their most “potent weapon”. “Because using artificial intelligence, as we did, tells you all sorts of things about that individual and how to convince them with what sort of advert. And you knew there would also be other people in their network who liked what they liked, so you could spread. And then you follow them. The computer never stops learning and it never stops monitoring.”","“It is creepy! It’s really creepy! It’s why I’m not on Facebook! I tried it on myself to see what information it had on me and I was like, ‘Oh my God!’ What’s scary is that my kids had put things on Instagram and it picked that up. It knew where my kids went to school.”","They hadn’t “employed” Cambridge Analytica, he said. No money changed hands. “They were happy to help.”","Why?","“Because Nigel is a good friend of the Mercers. And Robert Mercer introduced them to us. He said, ‘Here’s this company we think may be useful to you.’ What they were trying to do in the US and what we were trying to do had massive parallels. We shared a lot of information. Why wouldn’t you?” Behind Trump’s campaign and Cambridge Analytica, he said, were “the same people. It’s the same family.”","There were already a lot of questions swirling around Cambridge Analytica, and Andy Wigmore has opened up a whole lot more. Such as: are you supposed to declare services-in-kind as some sort of donation? The Electoral Commission says yes, if it was more than £7,500. And was it declared? The Electoral Commission says no. Does that mean a foreign billionaire had possibly influenced the referendum without that influence being apparent? It’s certainly a question worth asking.","In the last month or so, articles in first the Swiss and the US press have asked exactly what Cambridge Analytica is doing with US voters’ data. In a statement to the Observer, the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “Any business collecting and using personal data in the UK must do so fairly and lawfully. We will be contacting Cambridge Analytica and asking questions to find out how the company is operating in the UK and whether the law is being followed.”","Cambridge Analytica said last Friday they are in touch with the ICO and are completely compliant with UK and EU data laws. It did not answer other questions the Observer put to it this week about how it built its psychometric model, which owes its origins to original research carried out by scientists at Cambridge University’s Psychometric Centre, research based on a personality quiz on Facebook that went viral. More than 6 million people ended up doing it, producing an astonishing treasure trove of data.","These Facebook profiles – especially people’s “likes” – could be correlated across millions of others to produce uncannily accurate results. Michal Kosinski, the centre’s lead scientist, found that with knowledge of 150 likes, their model could predict someone’s personality better than their spouse. With 300, it understood you better than yourself. “Computers see us in a more robust way than we see ourselves,” says Kosinski.","But there are strict ethical regulations regarding what you can do with this data. Did SCL Group have access to the university’s model or data, I ask Professor Jonathan Rust, the centre’s director? “Certainly not from us,” he says. “We have very strict rules around this.”","A scientist, Aleksandr Kogan, from the centre was contracted to build a model for SCL, and says he collected his own data. Professor Rust says he doesn’t know where Kogan’s data came from. “The evidence was contrary. I reported it.” An independent adjudicator was appointed by the university. “But then Kogan said he’d signed a non-disclosure agreement with SCL and he couldn’t continue [answering questions].”","Kogan disputes this and says SCL satisfied the university’s inquiries. But perhaps more than anyone, Professor Rust understands how the kind of information people freely give up to social media sites could be used.","Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is a friend of the Mercers. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images","“The danger of not having regulation around the sort of data you can get from Facebook and elsewhere is clear. With this, a computer can actually do psychology, it can predict and potentially control human behaviour. It’s what the scientologists try to do but much more powerful. It’s how you brainwash someone. It’s incredibly dangerous.","“It’s no exaggeration to say that minds can be changed. Behaviour can be predicted and controlled. I find it incredibly scary. I really do. Because nobody has really followed through on the possible consequences of all this. People don’t know it’s happening to them. Their attitudes are being changed behind their backs.”","Mercer invested in Cambridge Analytica, the Washington Post reported, “driven in part by an assessment that the right was lacking sophisticated technology capabilities”. But in many ways, it’s what Cambridge Analytica’s parent company does that raises even more questions.","Emma Briant, a propaganda specialist at the University of Sheffield, wrote about SCL Group in her 2015 book, Propaganda and Counter-Terrorism: Strategies for Global Change. Cambridge Analytica has the technological tools to effect behavioural and psychological change, she said, but it’s SCL that strategises it. It has specialised, at the highest level – for Nato, the MoD, the US state department and others – in changing the behaviour of large groups. It models mass populations and then it changes their beliefs.","SCL was founded by someone called Nigel Oakes, who worked for Saatchi & Saatchi on Margaret Thatcher’s image, says Briant, and the company had been “making money out of the propaganda side of the war on terrorism over a long period of time. There are different arms of SCL but it’s all about reach and the ability to shape the discourse. They are trying to amplify particular political narratives. And they are selective in who they go for: they are not doing this for the left.”","In the course of the US election, Cambridge Analytica amassed a database, as it claims on its website, of almost the entire US voting population – 220 million people – and the Washington Post reported last week that SCL was increasing staffing at its Washington office and competing for lucrative new contracts with Trump’s administration. “It seems significant that a company involved in engineering a political outcome profits from what follows. Particularly if it’s the manipulation, and then resolution, of fear,” says Briant.","It’s the database, and what may happen to it, that particularly exercises Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician and data activist who has been investigating Cambridge Analytica and SCL for more than a year. “How is it going to be used?” he says. “Is it going to be used to try and manipulate people around domestic policies? Or to ferment conflict between different communities? It is potentially very scary. People just don’t understand the power of this data and how it can be used against them.”","There are two things, potentially, going on simultaneously: the manipulation of information on a mass level, and the manipulation of information at a very individual level. Both based on the latest understandings in science about how people work, and enabled by technological platforms built to bring us together.","Are we living in a new era of propaganda, I ask Emma Briant? One we can’t see, and that is working on us in ways we can’t understand? Where we can only react, emotionally, to its messages? “Definitely. The way that surveillance through technology is so pervasive, the collection and use of our data is so much more sophisticated. It’s totally covert. And people don’t realise what is going on.”","Public mood and politics goes through cycles. You don’t have to subscribe to any conspiracy theory, Briant says, to see that a mass change in public sentiment is happening. Or that some of the tools in action are straight out of the military’s or SCL’s playbook.","But then there’s increasing evidence that our public arenas – the social media sites where we post our holiday snaps or make comments about the news – are a new battlefield where international geopolitics is playing out in real time. It’s a new age of propaganda. But whose? This week, Russia announced the formation of a new branch of the military: “information warfare troops”.","Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda institute tells me that one third of all traffic on Twitter before the EU referendum was automated “bots” – accounts that are programmed to look like people, to act like people, and to change the conversation, to make topics trend. And they were all for Leave. Before the US election, they were five-to-one in favour of Trump – many of them Russian. Last week they have been in action in the Stoke byelection – Russian bots, organised by who? – attacking Paul Nuttall.","You can take a trending topic, such as fake news, and then weaponise it, turn it against the media that uncovered it","There’s nothing accidental about Trump’s behaviour, Andy Wigmore tells me. “That press conference. It was absolutely brilliant. I could see exactly what he was doing. There’s feedback going on constantly. That’s what you can do with artificial intelligence. You can measure ever reaction to every word. He has a word room, where you fix key words. We did it. So with immigration, there are actually key words within that subject matter which people are concerned about. So when you are going to make a speech, it’s all about how can you use these trending words.”","Wigmore met with Trump’s team right at the start of the Leave campaign. “And they said the holy grail was artificial intelligence.”","Who did?","“Jared Kushner and Jason Miller.”","Later, when Trump picked up Mercer and Cambridge Analytica, the game changed again. “It’s all about the emotions. This is the big difference with what we did. They call it bio-psycho-social profiling. It takes your physical, mental and lifestyle attributes and works out how people work, how they react emotionally.”","Bio-psycho-social profiling, I read later, is one offensive in what is called “cognitive warfare”. Though there are many others: “recoding the mass consciousness to turn patriotism into collaborationism,” explains a Nato briefing document on countering Russian disinformation written by an SCL employee. “Time-sensitive professional use of media to propagate narratives,” says one US state department white paper. “Of particular importance to psyop personnel may be publicly and commercially available data from social media platforms.”","Yet another details the power of a “cognitive casualty” – a “moral shock” that “has a disabling effect on empathy and higher processes such as moral reasoning and critical thinking”. Something like immigration, perhaps. Or “fake news”. Or as it has now become: “FAKE news!!!!”","How do you change the way a nation thinks? You could start by creating a mainstream media to replace the existing one with a site such as Breitbart. You could set up other websites that displace mainstream sources of news and information with your own definitions of concepts like “liberal media bias”, like CNSnews.com. And you could give the rump mainstream media, papers like the “failing New York Times!” what it wants: stories. Because the third prong of Mercer and Bannon’s media empire is the Government Accountability Institute.","Bannon co-founded it with $2m of Mercer’s money. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, was appointed to the board. Then they invested in expensive, long-term investigative journalism. “The modern economics of the newsroom don’t support big investigative reporting staffs,” Bannon told Forbes magazine. “You wouldn’t get a Watergate, a Pentagon Papers today, because nobody can afford to let a reporter spend seven months on a story. We can. We’re working as a support function.”","Welcome to the future of journalism in the age of platform capitalism. News organisations have to do a better job of creating new financial models. But in the gaps in between, a determined plutocrat and a brilliant media strategist can, and have, found a way to mould journalism to their own ends.","In 2015, Steve Bannon described to Forbes how the GAI operated, employing a data scientist to trawl the dark web (in the article he boasts of having access to $1.3bn worth of supercomputers) to dig up the kind of source material Google can’t find. One result has been a New York Times bestseller, Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, written by GAI’s president, Peter Schweizer and later turned into a film produced by Rebekah Mercer and Steve Bannon.","This, Bannon explained, is how you “weaponise” the narrative you want. With hard researched facts. With those, you can launch it straight on to the front page of the New York Times, as the story of Hillary Clinton’s cash did. Like Hillary’s emails it turned the news agenda, and, most crucially, it diverted the attention of the news cycle. Another classic psyops approach. “Strategic drowning” of other messages.","This is a strategic, long-term and really quite brilliant play. In the 1990s, Bannon explained, conservative media couldn’t take Bill Clinton down because “they wound up talking to themselves in an echo chamber”.","As, it turns out, the liberal media is now. We are scattered, separate, squabbling among ourselves and being picked off like targets in a shooting gallery. Increasingly, there’s a sense that we are talking to ourselves. And whether it’s Mercer’s millions or other factors, Jonathan Albright’s map of the news and information ecosystem shows how rightwing sites are dominating sites like YouTube and Google, bound tightly together by millions of links.","Is there a central intelligence to that, I ask Albright? “There has to be. There has to be some type of coordination. You can see from looking at the map, from the architecture of the system, that this is not accidental. It’s clearly being led by money and politics.”","There’s been a lot of talk in the echo chamber about Bannon in the last few months, but it’s Mercer who provided the money to remake parts of the media landscape. And while Bannon understands the media, Mercer understands big data. He understands the structure of the internet. He knows how algorithms work.","Robert Mercer did not respond to a request for comment for this piece. Nick Patterson, a British cryptographer, who worked at Renaissance Technologies in the 80s and is now a computational geneticist at MIT, described to me how he was the one who talent-spotted Mercer. “There was an elite group working at IBM in the 1980s doing speech research, speech recognition, and when I joined Renaissance I judged that the mathematics we were trying to apply to financial markets were very similar.”","He describes Mercer as “very, very conservative. He truly did not like the Clintons. He thought Bill Clinton was a criminal. And his basic politics, I think, was that he’s a rightwing libertarian, he wants the government out of things.”","He suspects that Mercer is bringing the brilliant computational skills he brought to finance to bear on another very different sphere. “We make mathematical models of the financial markets which are probability models, and from those we try and make predictions. What I suspect Cambridge Analytica do is that they build probability models of how people vote. And then they look at what they can do to influence that.”","Finding the edge is what quants do. They build quantitative models that automate the process of buying and selling shares and then they chase tiny gaps in knowledge to create huge wins. Renaissance Technologies was one of the first hedge funds to invest in AI. But what it does with it, how it’s been programmed to do it, is completely unknown. It is, Bloomberg reports, the “blackest box in finance”.","Johan Bollen, associate professor at Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing, tells me how he discovered one possible edge: he’s done research that shows you can predict stock market moves from Twitter. You can measure public sentiment and then model it. “Society is driven by emotions, which it’s always been difficult to measure, collectively. But there are now programmes that can read text and measure it and give us a window into those collective emotions.”","The research caused a huge ripple among two different constituencies. “We had a lot attention from hedge funds. They are looking for signals everywhere and this is a hugely interesting signal. My impression is hedge funds do have these algorithms that are scanning social feeds. The flash crashes we’ve had – sudden huge drops in stock prices – indicates these algorithms are being used at large scale. And they are engaged in something of an arms race.”","The other people interested in Bollen’s work are those who want not only to measure public sentiment, but to change it. Bollen’s research shows how it’s possible. Could you reverse engineer the national, or even the global, mood? Model it, and then change it?","Google, democracy and the truth about internet search","Read more","“It does seem possible. And it does worry me. There are quite a few pieces of research that show if you repeat something often enough, people start involuntarily to believe it. And that could be leveraged, or weaponised for propaganda. We know there are thousands of automated bots out there that are trying to do just that.”","THE war of the bots is one of the wilder and weirder aspects of the elections of 2016. At the Oxford Internet Institute’s Unit for Computational Propaganda, its director, Phil Howard, and director of research, Sam Woolley, show me all the ways public opinion can be massaged and manipulated. But is there a smoking gun, I ask them, evidence of who is doing this? “There’s not a smoking gun,” says Howard. “There are smoking machine guns. There are multiple pieces of evidence.”","“Look at this,” he says and shows me how, before the US election, hundreds upon hundreds of websites were set up to blast out just a few links, articles that were all pro-Trump. “This is being done by people who understand information structure, who are bulk buying domain names and then using automation to blast out a certain message. To make Trump look like he’s a consensus.”","And that requires money?","“That requires organisation and money. And if you use enough of them, of bots and people, and cleverly link them together, you are what’s legitimate. You are creating truth.”","You can take an existing trending topic, such as fake news, and then weaponise it. You can turn it against the very media that uncovered it. Viewed in a certain light, fake news is a suicide bomb at the heart of our information system. Strapped to the live body of us – the mainstream media.","One of the things that concerns Howard most is the hundreds of thousands of “sleeper” bots they’ve found. Twitter accounts that have tweeted only once or twice and are now sitting quietly waiting for a trigger: some sort of crisis where they will rise up and come together to drown out all other sources of information.","Like zombies?","“Like zombies.”","Many of the techniques were refined in Russia, he says, and then exported everywhere else. “You have these incredible propaganda tools developed in an authoritarian regime moving into a free market economy with a complete regulatory vacuum. What you get is a firestorm.”","This is the world we enter every day, on our laptops and our smartphones. It has become a battleground where the ambitions of nation states and ideologues are being fought – using us. We are the bounty: our social media feeds; our conversations; our hearts and minds. Our votes. Bots influence trending topics and trending topics have a powerful effect on algorithms, Woolley, explains, on Twitter, on Google, on Facebook. Know how to manipulate information structure and you can manipulate reality.","We’re not quite in the alternative reality where the actual news has become “FAKE news!!!” But we’re almost there. Out on Twitter, the new transnational battleground for the future, someone I follow tweets a quote by Marshall McLuhan, the great information theorist of the 60s. “World War III will be a guerrilla information war,” it says. “With no divisions between military and civilian participation.”","By that definition we’re already there.","Additional reporting by Paul-Olivier Dehaye","• Carole Cadwalladr will be hosting a discussion on technology’s disruption of democracy at the bluedot festival, Jodrell Bank, Cheshire, 7-9 July","A shadowy operation involving big data, billionaire friends of Trump and the disparate forces of the Leave campaign heavily influenced the result of the EU referendum.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The company just announced that it will end a feature called Partner Categories, launched back in 2013 out of a partnership between Facebook and major data brokers.","Third party data helps Facebook further atomize its user base into meaningful segments for advertisers. As TechCrunch explained when the data partnership first launched:","“Through new partnerships with top online and offline purchase data providers Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai, Facebook is now allowing advertisers to target hashed lists of existing and potential customers, and categories like role-playing gamers or soda drinkers.”","Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that the change is permanent, not a temporary precaution. In order to leverage the deep pool of data Facebook collects on users, the company mixes information that it obtains from users themselves (Pages a user liked, for instance) with information from advertisers (membership status in a loyalty program, for example) and with data obtained from third party providers.","While Facebook feels comfortable with the integrity of its data sourcing within the first two categories, it feels less settled about dipping into these aggregate pools of third party data. The decision was issued in light of the company’s recent privacy concerns over third-party data mishandling.","Facebook Product Marketing Director Graham Mudd elaborated on the decision in a statement:","“We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories. This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.”","Facebook clarified that it will still work with companies like Experian and Acxiom in order to measure ad performance and provide metrics, although it will also be conducting a review of those ongoing relationships. Facebook may also move toward sharing data in a shared server environment in order to offer further assurances of user privacy. As Mudd noted, the program will be discontinued in the coming months."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

And Lukoil had some very specific concerns.","Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.","Steve Bannon, was vice president of Cambridge Analytica at the time of the Lukoil discussions, had a very clear idea of how they could use the firm to win elections, not by pushing a candidate, but by shaping American culture.","In 2014, Steve Bannon – then executive chairman of the “alt-right” news network Breitbart – was [CA Developer and Analyst Christopher] Wylie’s boss. And Robert Mercer, the secretive US hedge-fund billionaire and Republican donor, was Cambridge Analytica’s investor. And the idea they bought into was to bring big data and social media to an established military methodology – “information operations” – then turn it on the US electorate.","Steve Bannon has made no effort to disguise his intention to bring down liberal democracy and replace it with white nationalism. He’s currently on a European tour, where he’s cheered on fascism at every stop and praised Mussolini’s fashion sense—all those fetching black shirts and sharp uniforms.","Cambridge Analytica was the tool that Bannon and the Mercers built to enable their fascist utopia. Their instrument for taking everything that marketing firms has learned about selling shoes or getting people to “click here,” and putting it to use as a landmine for democracy.","We are still only just starting to understand the maelstrom of forces that came together to create the conditions for what Mueller confirmed last month was “information warfare”. But Wylie offers a unique, worm’s-eye view of the events of 2016. Of how Facebook was hijacked, repurposed to become a theatre of war: how it became a launchpad for what seems to be an extraordinary attack on the US’s democratic process.","Christopher Wylie was approached by Steve Bannon to build a “psychological warfare mindfuck tool” that would use big data and social media, not to directly market a candidate, but to drive open cracks in American culture. The intention was to ratchet up racial, gender and social concerns, increasing unrest and convincing Americans—especially white Americans—that they were being left behind in their own country.","In 2014 and 2015, as they were building their tool, Cambridge had multiple contacts with Russian officials who were, not so coincidentally, seeking exactly the same kind of information and tool that Cambridge was building.","As Cambridge moved into supporting Trump, they used the information they had derived from Facebook data, and Facebook’s own targeted ad tools, to put information in front of voters in critical areas.","The ads, stories and links that Cambridge provided were often not specifically “vote for Trump” pieces, so much as they were continuations of their cultural-change effort. They were intended to create a narrative that working class white voters were being ignored by the Democratic Party, who were wholly owned by urban blacks and immigrants, and that blacks and immigrants were benefiting while whites were “forgotten.” Added onto this was a layer of stories about emasculating feminists.","If some of this sounds like the actions of the Russian “hackers” in 2016 election, it’s because their approaches and actions were almost identical. Both start in 2014 working to cause disruption and exacerbate social unrest. Both turn to supporting Trump once he becomes a candidate. Both use Facebook data and tools to target their actions. And both contact WikiLeaks as the go-to site for laundering the release of data.","This could be astounding coincidence—but a simpler explanation is that Cambridge Analytica, Steve Bannon and others in Trump’s digital effort coordinated their entire approach with Moscow.","The second story here is Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg’s giant social media firm was aware of Cambridge’s actions at least two years ago. But rather than let users know that their information had been lifted, they handled it quietly, behind the scenes. Facebook is now beating its chest, claiming that it really thought CA had destroyed the data, and that the skimming of 50 million profiles didn’t represent a reportable “breach.”","But this story comes on top of stories that show Facebook was not only eager to market their tools to Trump—at a huge discount—but was openly selling political ads during a US election to Russian companies that were so open about their intentions that they were paying Facebook in rubles.","In testimony to a Senate judiciary subcommittee, a senior Facebook lawyer admitted that Russian operatives had used the social network to spread “deeply disturbing” content designed to aggravate America’s racial and ideological divides.","“[Bannon] got it immediately. He believes in the whole Andrew Breitbart doctrine that politics is downstream from culture, so to change politics you need to change culture. And fashion trends are a useful proxy for that. ...","But Wylie wasn’t just talking about fashion. He had recently been exposed to a new discipline: “information operations”, which ranks alongside land, sea, air and space in the US military’s doctrine of the “five-dimensional battle space”.","Facebook’s story appears to be one of such overarching greed that they would sell anything to anyone for dollars—or for rubles—and then feign innocence.","An investigation about Cambridge Analytica is slated to run in the UK this week, but the company is currently fighting to keep this information from becoming public."],"isopubdate":""}

Paul Lewis reports on the Silicon Valley refuseniks alarmed by a race for human attention","Justin Rosenstein had tweaked his laptop’s operating system to block Reddit, banned himself from Snapchat, which he compares to heroin, and imposed limits on his use of Facebook. But even that wasn’t enough. In August, the 34-year-old tech executive took a more radical step to restrict his use of social media and other addictive technologies.","Rosenstein purchased a new iPhone and instructed his assistant to set up a parental-control feature to prevent him from downloading any apps.","He was particularly aware of the allure of Facebook “likes”, which he describes as “bright dings of pseudo-pleasure” that can be as hollow as they are seductive. And Rosenstein should know: he was the Facebook engineer who created the “like” button in the first place.","A decade after he stayed up all night coding a prototype of what was then called an “awesome” button, Rosenstein belongs to a small but growing band of Silicon Valley heretics who complain about the rise of the so-called “attention economy”: an internet shaped around the demands of an advertising economy.","These refuseniks are rarely founders or chief executives, who have little incentive to deviate from the mantra that their companies are making the world a better place. Instead, they tend to have worked a rung or two down the corporate ladder: designers, engineers and product managers who, like Rosenstein, several years ago put in place the building blocks of a digital world from which they are now trying to disentangle themselves. “It is very common,” Rosenstein says, “for humans to develop things with the best of intentions and for them to have unintended, negative consequences.”","Rosenstein, who also helped create Gchat during a stint at Google, and now leads a San Francisco-based company that improves office productivity, appears most concerned about the psychological effects on people who, research shows, touch, swipe or tap their phone 2,617 times a day.","There is growing concern that as well as addicting users, technology is contributing toward so-called “continuous partial attention”, severely limiting people’s ability to focus, and possibly lowering IQ. One recent study showed that the mere presence of smartphones damages cognitive capacity – even when the device is turned off. “Everyone is distracted,” Rosenstein says. “All of the time.”","It is very common for humans to develop things with the best of intentions that have unintended, negative consequences","Justin Rosenstein, creator of the 'like' button","But those concerns are trivial compared with the devastating impact upon the political system that some of Rosenstein’s peers believe can be attributed to the rise of social media and the attention-based market that drives it.","Drawing a straight line between addiction to social media and political earthquakes like Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump, they contend that digital forces have completely upended the political system and, left unchecked, could even render democracy as we know it obsolete.","In 2007, Rosenstein was one of a small group of Facebook employees who decided to create a path of least resistance – a single click – to “send little bits of positivity” across the platform. Facebook’s “like” feature was, Rosenstein says, “wildly” successful: engagement soared as people enjoyed the short-term boost they got from giving or receiving social affirmation, while Facebook harvested valuable data about the preferences of users that could be sold to advertisers. The idea was soon copied by Twitter, with its heart-shaped “likes” (previously star-shaped “favourites”), Instagram, and countless other apps and websites.","It was Rosenstein’s colleague, Leah Pearlman, then a product manager at Facebook and on the team that created the Facebook “like”, who announced the feature in a 2009 blogpost. Now 35 and an illustrator, Pearlman confirmed via email that she, too, has grown disaffected with Facebook “likes” and other addictive feedback loops. She has installed a web browser plug-in to eradicate her Facebook news feed, and hired a social media manager to monitor her Facebook page so that she doesn’t have to.","Justin Rosenstein, the former Google and Facebook engineer who helped build the ‘like’ button: ‘Everyone is distracted. All of the time.’ Photograph: Courtesy of Asana Communications","“One reason I think it is particularly important for us to talk about this now is that we may be the last generation that can remember life before,” Rosenstein says. It may or may not be relevant that Rosenstein, Pearlman and most of the tech insiders questioning today’s attention economy are in their 30s, members of the last generation that can remember a world in which telephones were plugged into walls.","It is revealing that many of these younger technologists are weaning themselves off their own products, sending their children to elite Silicon Valley schools where iPhones, iPads and even laptops are banned. They appear to be abiding by a Biggie Smalls lyric from their own youth about the perils of dealing crack cocaine: never get high on your own supply.","•••","One morning in April this year, designers, programmers and tech entrepreneurs from across the world gathered at a conference centre on the shore of the San Francisco Bay. They had each paid up to $1,700 to learn how to manipulate people into habitual use of their products, on a course curated by conference organiser Nir Eyal.","Eyal, 39, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, has spent several years consulting for the tech industry, teaching techniques he developed by closely studying how the Silicon Valley giants operate.","Are smartphones really making our children sad?","Read more","“The technologies we use have turned into compulsions, if not full-fledged addictions,” Eyal writes. “It’s the impulse to check a message notification. It’s the pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later.” None of this is an accident, he writes. It is all “just as their designers intended”.","He explains the subtle psychological tricks that can be used to make people develop habits, such as varying the rewards people receive to create “a craving”, or exploiting negative emotions that can act as “triggers”. “Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation,” Eyal writes.","Attendees of the 2017 Habit Summit might have been surprised when Eyal walked on stage to announce that this year’s keynote speech was about “something a little different”. He wanted to address the growing concern that technological manipulation was somehow harmful or immoral. He told his audience that they should be careful not to abuse persuasive design, and wary of crossing a line into coercion.","But he was defensive of the techniques he teaches, and dismissive of those who compare tech addiction to drugs. “We’re not freebasing Facebook and injecting Instagram here,” he said. He flashed up a slide of a shelf filled with sugary baked goods. “Just as we shouldn’t blame the baker for making such delicious treats, we can’t blame tech makers for making their products so good we want to use them,” he said. “Of course that’s what tech companies will do. And frankly: do we want it any other way?”","We’re not freebasing Facebook and injecting Instagram here","Nir Eyal, tech consultant","Without irony, Eyal finished his talk with some personal tips for resisting the lure of technology. He told his audience he uses a Chrome extension, called DF YouTube, “which scrubs out a lot of those external triggers” he writes about in his book, and recommended an app called Pocket Points that “rewards you for staying off your phone when you need to focus”.","Finally, Eyal confided the lengths he goes to protect his own family. He has installed in his house an outlet timer connected to a router that cuts off access to the internet at a set time every day. “The idea is to remember that we are not powerless,” he said. “We are in control.”","But are we? If the people who built these technologies are taking such radical steps to wean themselves free, can the rest of us reasonably be expected to exercise our free will?","Not according to Tristan Harris, a 33-year-old former Google employee turned vocal critic of the tech industry. “All of us are jacked into this system,” he says. “All of our minds can be hijacked. Our choices are not as free as we think they are.”","Harris, who has been branded “the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”, insists that billions of people have little choice over whether they use these now ubiquitous technologies, and are largely unaware of the invisible ways in which a small number of people in Silicon Valley are shaping their lives.","A graduate of Stanford University, Harris studied under BJ Fogg, a behavioural psychologist revered in tech circles for mastering the ways technological design can be used to persuade people. Many of his students, including Eyal, have gone on to prosperous careers in Silicon Valley.","Tristan Harris, a former Google employee, is now a critic of the tech industry: ‘Our choices are not as free as we think they are.’ Photograph: Robert Gumpert for the Guardian","Harris is the student who went rogue; a whistleblower of sorts, he is lifting the curtain on the vast powers accumulated by technology companies and the ways they are using that influence. “A handful of people, working at a handful of technology companies, through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today,” he said at a recent TED talk in Vancouver.","“I don’t know a more urgent problem than this,” Harris says. “It’s changing our democracy, and it’s changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships that we want with each other.” Harris went public – giving talks, writing papers, meeting lawmakers and campaigning for reform after three years struggling to effect change inside Google’s Mountain View headquarters.","It all began in 2013, when he was working as a product manager at Google, and circulated a thought-provoking memo, A Call To Minimise Distraction & Respect Users’ Attention, to 10 close colleagues. It struck a chord, spreading to some 5,000 Google employees, including senior executives who rewarded Harris with an impressive-sounding new job: he was to be Google’s in-house design ethicist and product philosopher.","Looking back, Harris sees that he was promoted into a marginal role. “I didn’t have a social support structure at all,” he says. Still, he adds: “I got to sit in a corner and think and read and understand.”","He explored how LinkedIn exploits a need for social reciprocity to widen its network; how YouTube and Netflix autoplay videos and next episodes, depriving users of a choice about whether or not they want to keep watching; how Snapchat created its addictive Snapstreaks feature, encouraging near-constant communication between its mostly teenage users.","I have two kids and I regret every minute that I’m not paying attention to them because my smartphone has sucked me in","Loren Brichter, app designer","The techniques these companies use are not always generic: they can be algorithmically tailored to each person. An internal Facebook report leaked this year, for example, revealed that the company can identify when teens feel “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”. Such granular information, Harris adds, is “a perfect model of what buttons you can push in a particular person”.","Tech companies can exploit such vulnerabilities to keep people hooked; manipulating, for example, when people receive “likes” for their posts, ensuring they arrive when an individual is likely to feel vulnerable, or in need of approval, or maybe just bored. And the very same techniques can be sold to the highest bidder. “There’s no ethics,” he says. A company paying Facebook to use its levers of persuasion could be a car business targeting tailored advertisements to different types of users who want a new vehicle. Or it could be a Moscow-based troll farm seeking to turn voters in a swing county in Wisconsin.","Harris believes that tech companies never deliberately set out to make their products addictive. They were responding to the incentives of an advertising economy, experimenting with techniques that might capture people’s attention, even stumbling across highly effective design by accident.","A friend at Facebook told Harris that designers initially decided the notification icon, which alerts people to new activity such as “friend requests” or “likes”, should be blue. It fit Facebook’s style and, the thinking went, would appear “subtle and innocuous”. “But no one used it,” Harris says. “Then they switched it to red and of course everyone used it.”","Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California. The company’s famous ‘likes’ feature has been described by its creator as ‘bright dings of pseudo-pleasure’. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images","That red icon is now everywhere. When smartphone users glance at their phones, dozens or hundreds of times a day, they are confronted with small red dots beside their apps, pleading to be tapped. “Red is a trigger colour,” Harris says. “That’s why it is used as an alarm signal.”","The most seductive design, Harris explains, exploits the same psychological susceptibility that makes gambling so compulsive: variable rewards. When we tap those apps with red icons, we don’t know whether we’ll discover an interesting email, an avalanche of “likes”, or nothing at all. It is the possibility of disappointment that makes it so compulsive.","It’s this that explains how the pull-to-refresh mechanism, whereby users swipe down, pause and wait to see what content appears, rapidly became one of the most addictive and ubiquitous design features in modern technology. “Each time you’re swiping down, it’s like a slot machine,” Harris says. “You don’t know what’s coming next. Sometimes it’s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it’s just an ad.”","•••","The designer who created the pull-to-refresh mechanism, first used to update Twitter feeds, is Loren Brichter, widely admired in the app-building community for his sleek and intuitive designs.","Now 32, Brichter says he never intended the design to be addictive – but would not dispute the slot machine comparison. “I agree 100%,” he says. “I have two kids now and I regret every minute that I’m not paying attention to them because my smartphone has sucked me in.”","Brichter created the feature in 2009 for Tweetie, his startup, mainly because he could not find anywhere to fit the “refresh” button on his app. Holding and dragging down the feed to update seemed at the time nothing more than a “cute and clever” fix. Twitter acquired Tweetie the following year, integrating pull-to-refresh into its own app.","Since then the design has become one of the most widely emulated features in apps; the downward-pull action is, for hundreds of millions of people, as intuitive as scratching an itch.","Inside the rehab saving young men from their internet addiction","Read more","Brichter says he is puzzled by the longevity of the feature. In an era of push notification technology, apps can automatically update content without being nudged by the user. “It could easily retire,” he says. Instead it appears to serve a psychological function: after all, slot machines would be far less addictive if gamblers didn’t get to pull the lever themselves. Brichter prefers another comparison: that it is like the redundant “close door” button in some elevators with automatically closing doors. “People just like to push it.”","All of which has left Brichter, who has put his design work on the backburner while he focuses on building a house in New Jersey, questioning his legacy. “I’ve spent many hours and weeks and months and years thinking about whether anything I’ve done has made a net positive impact on society or humanity at all,” he says. He has blocked certain websites, turned off push notifications, restricted his use of the Telegram app to message only with his wife and two close friends, and tried to wean himself off Twitter. “I still waste time on it,” he confesses, “just reading stupid news I already know about.” He charges his phone in the kitchen, plugging it in at 7pm and not touching it until the next morning.","“Smartphones are useful tools,” he says. “But they’re addictive. Pull-to-refresh is addictive. Twitter is addictive. These are not good things. When I was working on them, it was not something I was mature enough to think about. I’m not saying I’m mature now, but I’m a little bit more mature, and I regret the downsides.”","Not everyone in his field appears racked with guilt. The two inventors listed on Apple’s patent for “managing notification connections and displaying icon badges” are Justin Santamaria and Chris Marcellino. Both were in their early 20s when they were hired by Apple to work on the iPhone. As engineers, they worked on the behind-the-scenes plumbing for push-notification technology, introduced in 2009 to enable real-time alerts and updates to hundreds of thousands of third-party app developers. It was a revolutionary change, providing the infrastructure for so many experiences that now form a part of people’s daily lives, from ordering an Uber to making a Skype call to receiving breaking news updates.","Loren Brichter, who in 2009 designed the pull-to-refresh feature now used by many apps, on the site of the home he’s building in New Jersey: ‘Smartphones are useful tools, but they’re addictive … I regret the downsides.’ Photograph: Tim Knox for the Guardian","But notification technology also enabled a hundred unsolicited interruptions into millions of lives, accelerating the arms race for people’s attention. Santamaria, 36, who now runs a startup after a stint as the head of mobile at Airbnb, says the technology he developed at Apple was not “inherently good or bad”. “This is a larger discussion for society,” he says. “Is it OK to shut off my phone when I leave work? Is it OK if I don’t get right back to you? Is it OK that I’m not ‘liking’ everything that goes through my Instagram screen?”","His then colleague, Marcellino, agrees. “Honestly, at no point was I sitting there thinking: let’s hook people,” he says. “It was all about the positives: these apps connect people, they have all these uses – ESPN telling you the game has ended, or WhatsApp giving you a message for free from your family member in Iran who doesn’t have a message plan.”","A few years ago Marcellino, 33, left the Bay Area, and is now in the final stages of retraining to be a neurosurgeon. He stresses he is no expert on addiction, but says he has picked up enough in his medical training to know that technologies can affect the same neurological pathways as gambling and drug use. “These are the same circuits that make people seek out food, comfort, heat, sex,” he says.","All of it, he says, is reward-based behaviour that activates the brain’s dopamine pathways. He sometimes finds himself clicking on the red icons beside his apps “to make them go away”, but is conflicted about the ethics of exploiting people’s psychological vulnerabilities. “It is not inherently evil to bring people back to your product,” he says. “It’s capitalism.”","That, perhaps, is the problem. Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist who benefited from hugely profitable investments in Google and Facebook, has grown disenchanted with both companies, arguing that their early missions have been distorted by the fortunes they have been able to earn through advertising.","It’s changing our democracy, and it's changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships we want","Tristan Harris, former design ethicist at Google","He identifies the advent of the smartphone as a turning point, raising the stakes in an arms race for people’s attention. “Facebook and Google assert with merit that they are giving users what they want,” McNamee says. “The same can be said about tobacco companies and drug dealers.”","That would be a remarkable assertion for any early investor in Silicon Valley’s most profitable behemoths. But McNamee, 61, is more than an arms-length money man. Once an adviser to Mark Zuckerberg, 10 years ago McNamee introduced the Facebook CEO to his friend, Sheryl Sandberg, then a Google executive who had overseen the company’s advertising efforts. Sandberg, of course, became chief operating officer at Facebook, transforming the social network into another advertising heavyweight.","McNamee chooses his words carefully. “The people who run Facebook and Google are good people, whose well-intentioned strategies have led to horrific unintended consequences,” he says. “The problem is that there is nothing the companies can do to address the harm unless they abandon their current advertising models.”","But how can Google and Facebook be forced to abandon the business models that have transformed them into two of the most profitable companies on the planet?","McNamee believes the companies he invested in should be subjected to greater regulation, including new anti-monopoly rules. In Washington, there is growing appetite, on both sides of the political divide, to rein in Silicon Valley. But McNamee worries the behemoths he helped build may already be too big to curtail. “The EU recently penalised Google $2.42bn for anti-monopoly violations, and Google’s shareholders just shrugged,” he says.","Rosenstein, the Facebook “like” co-creator, believes there may be a case for state regulation of “psychologically manipulative advertising”, saying the moral impetus is comparable to taking action against fossil fuel or tobacco companies. “If we only care about profit maximisation,” he says, “we will go rapidly into dystopia.”","Does staring at your phone for hours on end serve any practical purpose?","Read more","•••","James Williams does not believe talk of dystopia is far-fetched. The ex-Google strategist who built the metrics system for the company’s global search advertising business, he has had a front-row view of an industry he describes as the “largest, most standardised and most centralised form of attentional control in human history”.","Williams, 35, left Google last year, and is on the cusp of completing a PhD at Oxford University exploring the ethics of persuasive design. It is a journey that has led him to question whether democracy can survive the new technological age.","He says his epiphany came a few years ago, when he noticed he was surrounded by technology that was inhibiting him from concentrating on the things he wanted to focus on. “It was that kind of individual, existential realisation: what’s going on?” he says. “Isn’t technology supposed to be doing the complete opposite of this?”","That discomfort was compounded during a moment at work, when he glanced at one of Google’s dashboards, a multicoloured display showing how much of people’s attention the company had commandeered for advertisers. “I realised: this is literally a million people that we’ve sort of nudged or persuaded to do this thing that they weren’t going to otherwise do,” he recalls.","He embarked on several years of independent research, much of it conducted while working part-time at Google. About 18 months in, he saw the Google memo circulated by Harris and the pair became allies, struggling to bring about change from within.","It is not inherently evil to bring people back to your product. It’s capitalism","Chris Marcellino, former Apple engineer","Williams and Harris left Google around the same time, and co-founded an advocacy group, Time Well Spent, that seeks to build public momentum for a change in the way big tech companies think about design. Williams finds it hard to comprehend why this issue is not “on the front page of every newspaper every day.","“Eighty-seven percent of people wake up and go to sleep with their smartphones,” he says. The entire world now has a new prism through which to understand politics, and Williams worries the consequences are profound.","The same forces that led tech firms to hook users with design tricks, he says, also encourage those companies to depict the world in a way that makes for compulsive, irresistible viewing. “The attention economy incentivises the design of technologies that grab our attention,” he says. “In so doing, it privileges our impulses over our intentions.”","That means privileging what is sensational over what is nuanced, appealing to emotion, anger and outrage. The news media is increasingly working in service to tech companies, Williams adds, and must play by the rules of the attention economy to “sensationalise, bait and entertain in order to survive”.","Tech and the rise of Trump: as the internet designs itself around holding our attention, politics and the media has become increasingly sensational. Photograph: John Locher/AP","In the wake of Donald Trump’s stunning electoral victory, many were quick to question the role of so-called “fake news” on Facebook, Russian-created Twitter bots or the data-centric targeting efforts that companies such as Cambridge Analytica used to sway voters. But Williams sees those factors as symptoms of a deeper problem.","It is not just shady or bad actors who were exploiting the internet to change public opinion. The attention economy itself is set up to promote a phenomenon like Trump, who is masterly at grabbing and retaining the attention of supporters and critics alike, often by exploiting or creating outrage.","Williams was making this case before the president was elected. In a blog published a month before the US election, Williams sounded the alarm bell on an issue he argued was a “far more consequential question” than whether Trump reached the White House. The reality TV star’s campaign, he said, had heralded a watershed in which “the new, digitally supercharged dynamics of the attention economy have finally crossed a threshold and become manifest in the political realm”.","Williams saw a similar dynamic unfold months earlier, during the Brexit campaign, when the attention economy appeared to him biased in favour of the emotional, identity-based case for the UK leaving the European Union. He stresses these dynamics are by no means isolated to the political right: they also play a role, he believes, in the unexpected popularity of leftwing politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, and the frequent outbreaks of internet outrage over issues that ignite fury among progressives.","All of which, Williams says, is not only distorting the way we view politics but, over time, may be changing the way we think, making us less rational and more impulsive. “We’ve habituated ourselves into a perpetual cognitive style of outrage, by internalising the dynamics of the medium,” he says.","It is against this political backdrop that Williams argues the fixation in recent years with the surveillance state fictionalised by George Orwell may have been misplaced. It was another English science fiction writer, Aldous Huxley, who provided the more prescient observation when he warned that Orwellian-style coercion was less of a threat to democracy than the more subtle power of psychological manipulation, and “man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions”.","Since the US election, Williams has explored another dimension to today’s brave new world. If the attention economy erodes our ability to remember, to reason, to make decisions for ourselves – faculties that are essential to self-governance – what hope is there for democracy itself?","“The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will,” he says. “If politics is an expression of our human will, on individual and collective levels, then the attention economy is directly undermining the assumptions that democracy rests on.” If Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat are gradually chipping away at our ability to control our own minds, could there come a point, I ask, at which democracy no longer functions?","“Will we be able to recognise it, if and when it happens?” Williams replies. “And if we can’t, then how do we know it hasn’t happened already?”"],"isopubdate":"2017-10-06"}

The “turkers,” as they’re known, tend to perform work that is rote and repetitive, like flagging pornographic images or digging through search engine results for email addresses. Most jobs pay between 1 and 15 cents. “Turking makes us our rent money and helps pay off debt,” one turker told The Intercept. Another turker has called the work “voluntary slave labor.”","The task posted by “Global Science Research” appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would “download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.”","“Our terms of service clearly prohibit misuse,” said a spokesperson for Amazon Web Services, by email. “When we learned of this activity back in 2015, we suspended the requester for violating our terms of service.”","Although Facebook’s early growth was driven by closed, exclusive networks at college and universities, it has gradually herded users to agree to increasingly permissive terms of service. By 2014, anything a user’s friends could see was also potentially visible to the developers of any app that they chose to download. Some of the turkers noticed that the Global Science Research app appeared to be taking advantage of Facebook’s porousness. “Someone can learn everything about you by looking at hundreds of pics, messages, friends, and likes,” warned one, writing on a message board. “More than you realize.” Others were more blasé. “I don’t put any info on FB,” one wrote. “Not even my real name … it’s backwards that people put sooo much info on Facebook, and then complain when their privacy is violated.”","In late 2015, the turkers began reporting that the Global Science Research survey had abruptly shut down. The Guardian had published a report that exposed exactly who the turkers were working for. Their data was being collected by Aleksandr Kogan, a young lecturer at Cambridge University. Kogan founded Global Science Research in 2014, after the university’s psychology department refused to allow him to use its own pool of data for commercial purposes. The data collection that Kogan undertook independent of the university was done on behalf of a military contractor called Strategic Communication Laboratories, or SCL. The company’s election division claims to use “data-driven messaging” as part of “delivering electoral success.”","SCL has a growing U.S. spin-off, called Cambridge Analytica, which was paid millions of dollars by Donald Trump’s campaign. Much of the money came from committees funded by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who reportedly has a large stake in Cambridge Analytica. For a time, one of Cambridge Analytica’s officers was Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s senior adviser. Months after Bannon claimed to have severed ties with the company, checks from the Trump campaign for Cambridge Analytica’s services continued to show up at one of Bannon’s addresses in Los Angeles.","“You can say Mr. Mercer declined to comment,” said Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesperson for Robert Mercer, by email.","Facebook Elections signs in the media area at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Aug. 6, 2015, before the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election.","Photo: John Minchillo/AP","The Intercept interviewed five individuals familiar with Kogan’s work for SCL. All declined to be identified, citing concerns about an ongoing inquiry at Cambridge and fears of possible litigation. Two sources familiar with the SCL project told The Intercept that Kogan had arranged for more than 100,000 people to complete the Facebook survey and download an app. A third source with direct knowledge of the project said that Global Science Research obtained data from 185,000 survey participants as well as their Facebook friends. The source said that this group of 185,000 was recruited through a data company, not Mechanical Turk, and that it yielded 30 million usable profiles. No one in this larger group of 30 million knew that “likes” and demographic data from their Facebook profiles were being harvested by political operatives hired to influence American voters.","Kogan declined to comment. In late 2014, he gave a talk in Singapore in which he claimed to have “a sample of 50+ million individuals about whom we have the capacity to predict virtually any trait.” Global Science Research’s public filings for 2015 show the company holding 145,111 British pounds in its bank account. Kogan has since changed his name to Spectre. Writing online, he has said that he changed his name to Spectre after getting married. “My wife and I are both scientists and quite religious, and light is a strong symbol of both,” he explained.","The purpose of Kogan’s work was to develop an algorithm for the “national profiling capacity of American citizens” as part of SCL’s work on U.S. elections, according to an internal document signed by an SCL employee describing the research.","“We do not do any work with Facebook likes,” wrote Lindsey Platts, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica, in an email. The company currently “has no relationship with GSR,” Platts said.","“Cambridge Analytica does not comment on specific clients or projects,” she added when asked whether the company was involved with Global Science Research’s work in 2014 and 2015.","The Guardian, which was was the first to report on Cambridge Analytica’s work on U.S. elections, in late 2015, noted that the company drew on research “spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission.” Kogan disputed this at the time, telling The Guardian that his turker surveys had collected no more than “a couple of thousand responses” for any one client. While it is unclear how many responses Global Science Research obtained through Mechanical Turk and how many it recruited through a data company, all five of the sources interviewed by The Intercept confirmed that Kogan’s work on behalf of SCL involved collecting data from survey participants’ networks of Facebook friends, individuals who had not themselves consented to give their data to Global Science Research and were not aware that they were the objects of Kogan’s study. In September 2016, Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, said that the company built a model based on “hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans” filling out personality surveys, generating a “model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.”","Shortly after The Guardian published its 2015 article, Facebook contacted Global Science Research and requested that it delete the data it had taken from Facebook users. Facebook’s policies give Facebook the right to delete data gathered by any app deemed to be “negatively impacting the Platform.” The company believes that Kogan and SCL complied with the request, which was made during the Republican primary, before Cambridge Analytica switched over from Ted Cruz’s campaign to Donald Trump’s. It remains unclear what was ultimately done with the Facebook data, or whether any models or algorithms derived from it wound up being used by the Trump campaign.","In public, Facebook continues to maintain that whatever happened during the run-up to the election was business as usual. “Our investigation to date has not uncovered anything that suggests wrongdoing,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Intercept.","Facebook appears not to have considered Global Science Research’s data collection to have been a serious ethical lapse. Joseph Chancellor, Kogan’s main collaborator on the SCL project and a former co-owner of Global Science Research, is now employed by Facebook Research. “The work that he did previously has no bearing on the work that he does at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Intercept.","Chancellor declined to comment.","Cambridge Analytica has marketed itself as classifying voters using five personality traits known as OCEAN — Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism — the same model used by University of Cambridge researchers for in-house, non-commercial research. The question of whether OCEAN made a difference in the presidential election remains unanswered. Some have argued that big data analytics is a magic bullet for drilling into the psychology of individual voters; others are more skeptical. The predictive power of Facebook likes is not in dispute. A 2013 study by three of Kogan’s former colleagues at the University of Cambridge showed that likes alone could predict race with 95 percent accuracy and political party with 85 percent accuracy. Less clear is their power as a tool for targeted persuasion; Cambridge Analytica has claimed that OCEAN scores can be used to drive voter and consumer behavior through “microtargeting,” meaning narrowly tailored messages. Nix has said that neurotic voters tend to be moved by “rational and fear-based” arguments, while introverted, agreeable voters are more susceptible to “tradition and habits and family and community.”","Dan Gillmor, director of the Knight Center at Arizona State University, said he was skeptical of the idea that the Trump campaign got a decisive edge from data analytics. But, he added, such techniques will likely become more effective in the future. “It’s reasonable to believe that sooner or later, we’re going to see widespread manipulation of people’s decision-making, including in elections, in ways that are more widespread and granular, but even less detectable than today,” he wrote in an email.","Donald Trump throws a hat to supporters during a campaign rally on Sept. 15, 2015, in Los Angeles.","Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images","Trump’s circle has been open about its use of Facebook to influence the vote. Joel Pollak, an editor at Breitbart, writes in his campaign memoir about Trump’s “armies of Facebook ‘friends,’ … bypassing the gatekeepers in the traditional media.” Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, has written in his own campaign memoir about “geo-targeting” cities to deliver a debunked claim that Bill Clinton had fathered a child out of wedlock, and narrowing down the audience “based on preferences in music, age range, black culture, and other urban interests.”","Clinton, of course, had her own analytics effort, and digital market research is a normal part of any political campaign. But the quantity of data compiled on individuals during the run-up to the election is striking. Alexander Nix, head of Cambridge Analytica, has claimed to “have a massive database of 4-5,000 data points on every adult in America.” Immediately after the election, the company tried to take credit for the win, claiming that its data helped the Trump campaign set the candidate’s travel schedule and place online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times. Since then, the company has been de-emphasizing its reliance on psychological profiling.","The Information Commissioner’s Office, an official privacy watchdog within the British government, is now looking into whether Cambridge Analytica and similar companies might pose a risk to voters’ rights. The British inquiry was triggered by reports in The Observer of ties between Robert Mercer, Cambridge Analytica, and the Leave.EU campaign, which worked to persuade British voters to leave the European Union. While Nix has previously talked about the firm’s work for Leave.EU, Cambridge Analytica now denies that it had any paid role in the campaign.","Leave.EU signage is displayed in London on March 5, 2016.","Photo: Rex Features/AP Images","In the U.S., where privacy laws are looser, there is no investigation. Cambridge Analytica is said to be pitching its products to several federal agencies, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff. SCL, its parent company, has new offices near the White House and has reportedly been advised by Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, on how to increase its federal business. (A spokesperson for Flynn denied that he had done any work for SCL.)","Years before the arrival of Kogan’s turkers, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg tried to address privacy concerns around the company’s controversial Beacon program, which quietly funneled data from outside websites into Facebook, often without Facebook users being aware of the process. Reflecting on Beacon, Zuckerberg attributed part of Facebook’s success to giving “people control over what and how they share information.” He said that he regretted making Beacon an “opt-out system instead of opt-in … if someone forgot to decline to share something, Beacon went ahead and still shared it with their friends.”","Seven years later, Facebook appears to have made the same mistake, but with far greater consequences. In mid-2014, however, Facebook announced a new review process, where the company would make sure that new apps asked only for data they would actually use. “People want more control,” the company said at that time. “It’s going to make a huge difference with building trust with your app’s audience.” Existing apps were given a full year to switch over to have Facebook review how they handled user data. By that time, Global Science Research already had what it needed."],"isopubdate":""}

Its elevated & expensive role in the Trump digital marketing team’s self-proclaimed voter suppression rollout was the culmination of several years of preparation by military and anti-government interests on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as nationless finance & technology kingmakers seeking to enhance their own profit power.","As a direct result of the reporting led by the Observer’s Carole Cadwalladr, Cambridge Analytica is already under active investigation for violating United Kingdom data protection laws, as related to their involvement with Leave.EU. It’s unclear if anything will come of this, as Leave’s ‘Bad Boys of Brexit’ seem quite confident they were able to skate through some loopholes and use some creative accounting to their advantage.","Separate issues have been under the microscope of UK authorities. For example, one is the improper collection & use of voters’ personal data via the internet for political marketing/advertising purposes, and another is the question of foreign (read: non-UK) money being used to fund the Leave campaigns. Cambridge Analytica is at the center of the data inquiry, and US-based stock trader Robert Mercer has been identified as the primary source of the foreign money, but in both cases political media production & dissemination is the underlying issue.","Our previous article looked at the undertold history of the nonprofit organization Citizens United regarding highly influential American political media & advertising from 1988 to 2011, and we’ll continue just prior to where we left off. SCL was in a down period at the beginning of our tale, and its Cambridge Analytica did not yet exist. Donald Trump would soon begin early-2011 meetings with his new friends Steve Bannon and Citizens United’s David Bossie (fresh off a huge Supreme Court victory) to plot out a Trump 2012 presidential campaign, but they ultimately decided to once again put his formal aspirations on hold.","PROFIT BOTS","Bannon & Bossie began releasing their political issue advocacy film collaborations in 2010, months after Bossie’s Citizens United v FEC case received its big Supreme Court victory, but they were among many looking to exploit the new election [de]regulations. One such up-and-coming major player was half-billionaire Robert Mercer.","Mercer had won awards in his first career, working for IBM’s Watson AI project in the field of natural language processing, where he wrote code teaching computers how to understand humans. The avid yachtsman changed tacks slightly in 1993, as he went on to make his sudden fortune with the wildly profitable private hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, also known as RenTec, of which he is now co-CEO. Its stock-in-trade, if you will, is using quantitative analysis and high frequency trading (HFT) to win big on the global financial markets.","Quantitative analysis is a blanket term that covers a range of techniques, but the basic idea is to execute financial transactions based on predictions made by calculating large groups of historical alphanumeric sets; i.e., using existing patterns to predict future outcomes. When you’re anticipating future numbers, you might naturally expect to first inspect past numbers.","However, the standard human brain can only do so much these days, so the vast majority of work involved in this field is performed by computers. Even experts in the field — unsurprisingly called ‘quants’, though RenTec is known for exclusively employing mathematicians, physicists, and cryptographers — are still only able to quickly & accurately calculate a small grouping of historical variables. As a result, giant datasets — consisting of any number of different variables tracked over time — are fed into computers which calculate them using complex math equations, following repeatable series of preprogrammed steps that are known as algorithms.","Not only do quants employ algorithms to spit out robotically identified market trends, but they frequently direct the algorithms to buy and sell stocks all on their own. This outsourcing of labor is known as algorithmic trading, and since the computers involved are usually employing algorithms on both sides of these transactions, the trades can happen incredibly quickly (nanoseconds) and in high volumes (around half of all US equity trades). Now we’re describing the quant subgenre of high frequency trading.","HFT is very controversial within the financial industry, with supporters saying it helps keep the markets liquid & transparent and detractors saying it increases volatility, but it’s probably safe to say most outside observers think it’s very dangerous. It’s been responsible for “flash crashes”; allowed for massive accumulations of private wealth for no reason other than automated exploitation of loopholes, timezones, and bandwidth; played a sizable (or at least very profitable) role in the 2008 global financial meltdown; and put the planet’s resources under the control of larval artificial intelligence.","For these reasons, it should be no surprise HFT came under the scrutiny of regulators, but only after a decade of algorithmic trading that was enabled by the 2000 changeover to stock decimalization (pricing shares by pennies instead of quarter-dollars). The EU had been fairly vigilant in that regard, but the US government hadn’t pricked up its ears until after the July 2009 arrest of Sergey Aleynikov, a Russian-born U.S. citizen, for allegedly stealing ‘proprietary’ algorithms from his employer Goldman Sachs.","Aleynikov was accused of sticking his digital avatar hand into the “black box” — the batches of algorithms that are kept secret by HFT firms — of Goldman Sachs, but his still-active case has been in & out of courts for these past 8 years, partially because some of the laws he broke had not yet been fully written. That genre of legislative inefficiency sparked the interest of Peter DeFazio, a Democratic congressman from Oregon, which in turn caught the eyes of quants and black box houses like RenTec.","4 minutes of HFT","DeFazio spearheaded the idea of a financial transactions tax — to impose a micropercent tax on trades that would only affect the high-volume HFT in any tangible way— and teamed up with a couple colleagues to bring bills to the floor of Congress. He got nowhere in 2009, two years after the “Quant Quake”, nor in 2010, even after the May 6th “Flash Crash” again alerted the public to the dangers of HFT. Despite the failure to ignite substantial interest, his dedication to reform did not go unnoticed.","TEST DRIVING CITIZENS UNITED","DeFazio’s 2010 reelection campaign was nearly derailed by the appearance of highly-funded ads which attacked him and supported his ‘Tea Party’ Republican opponent, Art Robinson. Created by a PAC calling itself Concerned Taxpayers of America (CTA), it had been an ongoing mystery at the time as to who put up the big money for that organization. Only a few weeks before the election, as per the then-newly lax criteria set forth by the Citizens United decision earlier that year, was it revealed that one of the only two funders was Mr Robert Mercer, who contributed $643,750.","Investigation by the Washington Post prior to the reveal turned up even more curiosities, including a denial of the existence of CTA by a PR rep standing in the doorway of its registered address and directly to DeFazio’s face. Also, we should not be surprised to learn CTA’s treasurer was Jason Miller, who would go on to become Trump’s campaign communications director starting 30 June 2016. Miller was briefly named White House communications director in December 2016, before recusing himself a few days later after a fellow campaign worker accused the otherwise married Miller of fathering her unborn child.","Mercer’s attacks on DeFazio are easily attributable to HFT tax proposals, but his support of political then-novice Art Robinson is also notable. Robinson is a crackpot pseudoscientist whose mentor was Nobel Prize Winner Linus Pauling, before they acrimoniously parted ways in a divorce which ultimately ended in Robinson’s $25.5m lawsuit against the Pauling Institute (which he settled for $575k).","Robinson then became a supporter of homeopathic disease cures via exposure to raw radioactive elements, as well as a well-known climate change denier, an obsessive hoarder of 14,000+ human urine samples, and a forest-dwelling widower who homeschooled his 6 children using his own Bible-based, available-for-sale “Robinson Curriculum” (all of which basically makes him the Anti-Captain Fantastic). He lost to DeFazio in 2010 and lost again & again & again in 3 subsequent elections, but managed to become the chairman of the Oregon Republican Party from 2013–15, and has recently been considered for the role of Trump’s chief Science Adviser.","Robert Mercer and his politically powerful daughter Rebekah are said to have become fans of Robinson’s after reading his newsletter “Access to Energy”, which argues such things as Chernobyl radiation and carbon pollution are ultimately beneficial to planetary life. However, Mercer has privately “downplay[ed] the dangers posed by nuclear war” when excitedly expressing his belief that Hiroshima & Nagasaki radiation made the greater population of Japan healthier, and Robinson has published a book & multi-DVD set on Nuclear War Survival Skills, so they have that hobby in common.","After bringing someone like Robinson close to victory in 2010, the Mercers’ fresh taste for political power brought them the privileges and lifestyles of the rich & famous. They soon found themselves at a 2011 conference of the Club For Growth, a pro-business activist group for the conservative elite, which spent $6m of its own in support of 2010 GOP/Tea Party contenders. The Club is perhaps best known for being sued and fined by the FEC in 2005 for violating fair election laws. Its Executive Director David Keating then formed SpeechNow, a group which sued the FEC and did even more damage to campaign finance regulations via their Ninth Circuit Court victory in the immediate wake of Citizens United v FEC, but right now we’re focused on the Club as the place where Mercer first met Andrew Breitbart.","BREITBART OUT, BANNON & MERCER IN","Three years after meeting Steve Bannon in 2004 — at the Beverly Hills movie premiere of Bannon’s directorial debut In the Face of Evil: Reagan’s War in Word and Deed — Breitbart left The Drudge Report to start his own media outlet, Breitbart News, which he said was intended to be “unapologetically pro-freedom and pro-Israel.” Breitbart rapidly became the darling of the ultraconservatives and elbowed his way into mainstream relevance, becoming a driving force in the 2009–10 rise of the explicitly anti-Obama Tea Party.","With their respective stars on the rise, it’s impossible to know who was more smitten with whom at the Spring 2011 Club For Growth meeting, but Breitbart took enough interest in the Mercers to later introduce them to his man Bannon. Having been with Breitbart News since its inception, Bannon ended up hitting it off with the Mercers and they immediately joined forces. In June 2011, the Mercers invested $10m in Breitbart, becoming co-owners in the process, but one of their contract stipulations demanded that their brand new friend Bannon be promoted to the board of directors.","Bannon & Breitbart, aka the Three Men and A Baby ghost","Around that same time in 2011, the 42yo Breitbart suffered a heart attack. Within a year, he collapsed on an L.A. street and died on 1 March 2012, with his autopsy blaming another massive heart attack due to an enlarged heart. Later that very same day, Bannon has said he met with New York investors to plan the future of Breitbart News, and he would quickly be named Executive Chairman on 19 March.","This was a crucial time period for all of these players. In February 2012, Bannon founded the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) with $2m in seed funding from the Mercers. Rebekah Mercer became Chairwoman, and Bannon installed Peter Schweizer — author of Reagan’s War, the book adapted into Bannon’s first “documentary” — as president of GAI. Like Bossie and Mercer, Schweizer is yet another Clinton-hating, Reagan-adoring, tax reform & financial deregulation advocate and conspiracy theorist.","A couple of the first ‘reports’ out of the gate for GAI: a treatise attesting to the horrors of food stamps, as well as another which itemized every instance of President Barack Obama’s attendance at his daily briefings. Breitbart predictably publishes multiple stories each time GAI puts out a press release, but both of those early missives were picked up for publication and discussion in major media outlets, such as ABC News,Washington Times,National Review, and Washington Post.","Peter Schweizer on Russia Today","What we’ll call ‘Mercer Money’ was also funneled into Citizens United’s coffers, to the tune of another 2 million dollars. This cash was at least partly used to fund Bannon & Bossie’s 4th Citizens United Productions collaboration, The Hope and the Change, an anti-Obama movie which premiered at the August Republican National Convention and played in theatres & on cable TV up through Election Day. Once again, the Citizens United v FEC decision enabled that release schedule.","And yet despite all of this intrigue, perhaps the most important development and deployment of Mercer Money in 2012 came in the form of a $5,000,000 investment in a relatively unknown British defense contractor, then called Strategic Communication Laboratories Ltd but now known as SCL Group. The Mercers tossed the pounds across the pond to enable data analytics research, with Rebekah wanting a “results-oriented consultant.”","This investment has been noted elsewhere as a natural fit for Robert Mercer, as his background in algorithms and language processing mesh with what we now know about SCL’s recent use of big data to enhance electioneering communications, but that actually didn’t yet make sense at the time. Back then, the only technology strongly tied to SCL would have been communications hardware (as opposed to database software), but only as one aspect of their rather straightforward advertising-cum-propaganda tactics.","SCL had worked on some elections, in a few war zones, and for the Pentagon over the years, with perhaps their most notable appearance being in 2004 Ukraine at the time of the Orange Revolution (allegedly on behalf of the vested interests of British intelligence, according to one untrustworthy source, as previously noted by TEXTIFIRE). SCL carries a Secret clearance as a ‘List X’ contractor for the British Ministry of Defence and had always portrayed themselves as experts in the field of behavioral dynamics and psychological warfare, but had no known background in the algorithmic data processing with which they are now associated.","So why would an ill-equipped foreign defense contractor like SCL be called upon by the Mercers to do big data research? The answer again appears to lie somewhere in the weeds near Steve Bannon.","WEREN’T THE FIRST TEA PARTIERS ANGRY AT THE BRITS..?","Bannon became interested in United Kingdom politics in the early 2010s, seeing it as fertile ground for ideological manipulation. He began making friends with far right bloggers and politicians, particularly those tied in with Nigel Farage’s United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). A hard right party commonly disparaged as fascist, UKIP sought to restore what it saw as true conservatism. Bannon was greatly invested in the USA Tea Party ‘movement’ at the time, as evidenced by his movie productions and speaking engagements, so he viewed UKIP as a natural comrade in arms.","UKIP had been stagnating as a political force while known as a single platform party, focused almost entirely on immigration crackdown and demand for UK’s exit from the European Union. Co-founder Farage had returned to lead the party for a 2nd time in November 2010 — later in the same week as the first Tea Party Republicans were elected in the US midterms — after failing in his bid to become House of Commons Speaker earlier that year, and began to incorporate a wider variety of populist messaging with a focus on local elections to increase growth.","Soon after Bannon took over Breitbart in the summer of 2012, he brought Farage to the USA for a grand tour of New York and Washington, D.C. During this trip, Bannon introduced Farage to a number of movers & shakers, including the staff of Jeff Sessions, the then-senator from Alabama who is now US Attorney General. This was certainly not the first connection between UK eurosceptics and US nativists, however.","Throughout the previous year, a UK political activist ‘pressure group’ called Atlantic Bridge was garnering a lot of press for all the wrong reasons. Fronted by then-Defence Secretary Liam Fox, after being founded in 1997 by Fox and Reagan BFF/ex-UK-PM Margaret Thatcher, its stated goal was to protect the 80's holdover concept of the US & UK’s military and cultural ‘special relationship’ from “the European integrationists who would like to pull Britain away from its relationship with the United States.”","Atlantic Bridge fell into the sea in late 2011, after extensive investigations found Fox had been implementing a “shadow foreign policy” by internationally courting a variety of corporate lobbyists and military contractors via the dark money donated to Bridge as a falsely-labeled charity. Fox then resigned his Cabinet position, taking a few others down with him.","One of those affected was yet another powerful hedge fund manager, ex-Goldman Sachs trader, climate-change denier & funder, and longtime Tory/Conservative donor named Michael Hintze who provided the majority of those donations and lent his private jet to Fox for schmoozy jaunts to meet with D.C. defence contractors. With a strong interest in geopolitical wargames, a habit of supporting Defence Secretaries, and a predilection for hiring senior military officials at his powerful firm Convertible & Quantitative Strategies, it’s small wonder Hintze sought to establish a Western security superhighway before the Bridge collapsed.","Back in 2007, however, Atlantic Bridge was still in its prime, and it gained even more power when a giant among US political activist groups began an official partnership with it. The American Legislative Exchange Council — better known as ALEC — set up a stateside nonprofit called the Atlantic Bridge Project, in order to “foster positive relationships between conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic, so they may further the ideals exemplified by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.”","Atlantic Bridge’s Liam Fox thanking ALEC 2008","ALEC’s decades-old modus operandi is to write complete versions of new legislation, which invariably benefits only its powerful corporate members, to be passed off to complicit politicians and introduced in Congress as original products. An official ALEC newsletter from Dec 2007 bragged of the Bridge Project’s new plans to enact “a series of events aimed at conservative leaders from the field of politics, media, business, and academia — exposing them to innovative conservative thinking from the U.S. and Great Britain and helping them forge new transatlantic relationships.”","Catherine Bray is pictured in the newsletter as the Director of International Relations for Atlantic Bridge; she had previously worked for prominent UKIP member & climate change denier Roger Helmer and subsequently worked for Tory Daniel Hannan, “the man who brought you Brexit.” In 2015, Bray married Wells Griffith, who became the battleground states director for Trump’s presidential campaign.","Managing the D.C. operations for the Project was Gordon Cohen Strategies LLC, co-founded by Lee Cohen, Atlantic Bridge’s Washington DC Director, and J.D. Gordon, a retired Pentagon spokesman and well-traveled defense lobbyist. Lee Cohen is now an ardent Trump supporter, publishing an IJR essay in November 2016 predicting Trump and new UK PM Theresa May will be the new Reagan & Thatcher.","Within a few days of Liam Fox’s resignation, J.D. Gordon took a job as communications director for Herman Cain’s 2012 presidential campaign, in which Tea Partier Cain promised to reduce corporate taxes and install the Shell Oil CEO as head of the EPA. Cain began briefly leading Obama in the polls at that time and was the most reported-on GOP candidate in 2011, but quit the race less than 2 months later after sexual misconduct charges arose.","Gordon was slightly controversial when he originally joined up as one of Cain’s foreign policy advisers, as he had recently left a fellowship position at the Washington-based Center for Security Policy, a far-right think tank (or perhaps hate group) devoted to advancing founder and former Reagan official Frank Gaffney’s pet cause of extreme Islamophobia. Cain’s campaign also absorbed the staff of Gordon’s own embryonic thinktank, the Center for Security and Democracy, which included a former Heritage Foundation manager.","J.D. Gordon is most recently known for his work as a key foreign policy adviser to Cain clone Donald Trump, who counted Herman among his early campaign rally speakers/surrogates, and about whom Gordon wrote a pro-Trump Breitbart article in April 2016. Gordon was also Jeff Sessions’ deputy, allegedly traveled to Budapest six times during the campaign, participated in the infamous July 2016 Republican National Convention meeting — hosted by the Heritage Foundation — involving co-adviser Carter Page and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and is said to have previously recommended that Page embark on his Congressionally-investigated trip to Moscow. Gordon also claims he personally asked to water down the RNC platform with noncommittal language omitting lethal weapons support for Ukraine, and that Trump directly ordered him to do so.","(L to R) Lee, Johnson, Toomey, DeMint, Rubio","Atlantic Bridge’s leading light in the US Congress was South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint, then frequently cited as one of the farthest-right sitting Senators. An ardent tax reformer, Family member, and anti-immigration crusader, he was on board with the Tea Party from its inception in early 2009, setting the stage with the establishment of his Senate Conservatives Fund PAC in 2008. The Fund attacked Republicans for being too ‘moderate’ and then gave millions to the successful 2010 Senate campaigns of such first-time Tea Party candidates as Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee, and Pat Toomey. Also in 2010, DeMint introduced the first bill intended to repeal the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.","Senator DeMint followed up that legislation a few months later with his first published article/op-ed on Breitbart News, dated 6 May 2010. Breitbart repeatedly showered him with glowing coverage, so he went on to publish another article there on 27 Jul 2012, in which he endorsed Tea Party candidate Ted Cruz for Senate and lauded the aforementioned Club for Growth’s monetary “air and ground support” for Cruz’s campaign.","A large chunk of the money for that tactical assault was provided by Robert Mercer, with other miniature morsels of Mercer Money going to DeMint, Toomey, and Rubio at various times. Unsurprisingly, Club for Growth rated Paul, Johnson, Lee and DeMint as 4 of the only 5 Senators to vote ‘correctly’ 100% of the time, with Lee and Demint tying for the Heritage Foundation’s top honor at 99% approval.","DeMint resigned from the Senate less than two months after the 2012 election in order to become president of Heritage — a thinktank which shares an enormous number of historical, practical, and membership commonalities with ALEC — by which time Atlantic Bridge had been dead [in the UK] for over a year. Even so, it’s easy to imagine DeMint, Liam Fox, J.D. Gordon, and/or any of the other Atlantic Bridge ambassadors still managed to make their way to any one of the legendary parties thrown at the “Breitbart Embassy”, a four-story townhouse rented (?) by Breitbart near the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C.","As for the gregarious and cigar-chomping heavy drinker Nigel Farage, we don’t have to imagine anything. He was treated as the guest of honor at a Breitbart Embassy dinner & cocktail party in September 2014, where the stars of the new right rubbed shoulders with journalists from across the media spectrum. Other guests that night included LifeZette’s Laura Ingraham, a reporter from Rolling Stone, Jeff Sessions, and Sessions’ then-top aide Stephen Miller.","Steve Bannon had been partially living at the Embassy since at least 2011, when Breitbart staff and writers were first encouraged to work & sleep there, though it was initially expected to serve as a means to rub shoulders with the movers & shakers of the DC political elite. “Andrew [Breitbart] said that if you didn’t have a place within spitting distance of the Capitol, no one would come,” Bannon toldThe Washington Post at an Embassy blowout schmooze-and-boozefest CPAC rager in 2014. “He loved to throw big parties.”","But regardless of the precise circumstances by which Bannon became enmeshed with the UK’s conservative elite prior to mid-2012, engrossing as the detailed story may be, his friendship with UKIP & Brexit’s Farage tells us all we need to know. As such, we should be unsurprised to learn it was allegedly Steve Bannon who urged the Mercers in summer 2012 to invest US$5m in big data research funds with the British defence contractor SCL Group.","PSYOPS GOES MAINSTREAM","In October 2012, a few months after the Bannon-driven deposit of Mercer Money toward new election management technology, a Strategic Communication Laboratories subsidiary named SCL Elections was registered in the UK. All company shares were initially owned by Alexander Nix, Director of SCL Group and public face of the conglomerate, but its first and current Managing Director is Mark Turnbull.","Turnbull had previously worked for the tremendously influential public relations and strategic communications firm Bell Pottinger — co-founded by infamous PR guru Lord Timothy Bell — spending 18 years at the company. In 2004, he founded and led Bell Pottinger Public Advocacy (BPPA, fka Bell Pottinger Special Projects), which claimed to specialize in “understanding and influencing the human and social dynamics of conflict and cooperation…[using]…people’s identities, interests, networks and narratives that are the focal point for communications designed to deliver measurable change in support of political, social, developmental or military objectives.”","Bell Pottinger (B-PC) landed a 2004 Pentagon contract in Iraq devoted to manufacturing pro-Coalition media — including in-house advertising, video production, and paid placement of newspaper/TV/radio news items — in support of post-Saddam Hussein nation building and anti-Daesh messaging. The creative team of BPPA collaborated on the media directly with US military intelligence, with the crews working side-by-side in the most highly secured locations, such as Baghdad’s Camp Victory.","Though initially intended to be a 4-month contract, first granted by Ian Tunnicliffe’s Office of Strategic Communications of the Coalition Provisional Authority under USA’s pseudo-viceroy of Iraq, L. Paul Bremer, the project ultimately extended all the way to 2011. Upwards of 40 ‘stratcom’ companies — including BKSH & Associates, formed from the ashes of Black, Manafort, and Stone — followed B-PC’s lead, creating a veritable vortex of political propaganda and psychological operations experimentation. B-PC came out as the big winner of the free-for-all, as by the end of its time in Iraq, B-PC’s contract payouts had ballooned from US$5.8m to a total of $540m–660m.","Also present in Iraq during those years was a specialized British Armed Forces tri-service unit, the 15 (UK) Psychological Operations Group, formerly known as Shadow. Its stated objective was to “influence attitudes in order to affect behaviour” with “planned, culturally sensitive, truthful and attributable activities directed and disseminated by various means to an approved target audience.” It drew from the Army, Navy & Air Force, seeking out Reserves who were also “TV & film producers, camera operators, radio presenters, [and] graphic designers/illustrators for print/web.”","Two important members of 15 (UK) PSYOPS (aka 15 POG) were Stephen Jolly of the Ministry of Defence and Royal Navy Commander Steve Tatham, both graduates of Cambridge University-affiliated schools. A linguistic scientist, certified psyops planner, and instructor for 15 POG, Jolly went on to serve as the UK’s Director of Defence Communications, starting in Dec 2012. He retired in 2015 as the most senior serving psyops officer in British Defence, moving on to become Fellow of the UK Defence Academy and Fellow in Communications at the Cambridge University Judge Business School.","As Defence Comms Director, Jolly embraced the new ‘Army 2020’ holistic reform initiative, pushing a “full spectrum” approach which combines the fields of public relations, media operations, information operations (IO) and psyops. This led to the creation of the 77th Brigade of the British Army, which absorbed several specialized units, including the 15 (UK) PSYOPS Group. Its establishment received a fair amount of media coverage, due to the claim it would partially focus on utilizing social media to wage the ‘dark arts’ of asymmetric warfare, but its №1 Column focuses on “the behavioural analysis of actors, audiences and adversaries.”","Commander Steve Tatham served with 15 POG in Iraq, but commanded its Afghanistan regiment for years. He also plied his trade as Director of Communication Research at the UK Defence Academy, and was the UK’s longest continuously serving Influence Activities officer. Upon retirement he became Director of Operations at IOTA-Global, a UK company owned by Nigel Oakes, the founder of SCL and its research arm, Behavioural Dynamics Institute (BDi).","Grown just outside battlefields across the globe, Tatham designed a course titled “Target Audience Analysis” for the National Defence Academy of Latvia on behalf of the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, teaching several agencies how to counter Russia’s propaganda in Eastern Europe. Originally a 9-week intensive training, delivered as a collaboration between IOTA-Global, BDi, and SCL Defence (formerly an SCL Group subsidiary), Tatham has repeated the course in Moldova and Ukraine. As IOTA-Global recently disbanded its corporate status, Tatham is currently Director of Defence Operations at SCL Group.","Verbalisation’s RAID","Another pair of 15 (UK) PSYOPS veterans and avowed fans of the new 77th Brigade, Sven Hughes and David Stanhope, are leaders at the behavioral marketing firm Verbalisation, which bills itself as “the world’s first consultancy dedicated to changing behaviour by precision-engineering language.” Hughes, who also assisted NATO forces in Afghanistan, says his staff members are “largely ex-military personnel and political campaigners.” Stanhope spent eight years with 15 POG, serving under Cdr Tatham for a spell in Afghanistan, and also worked in 2011 for SCL (briefly joining fellow ex-IO/psyops agents Jerry Knight & the aforementioned Ian Tunnicliffe, both former SCL directors). The POG vets claim Verbalisation’s RAID aka Rapid Audience Insight Diagnostics® software tool can help military and marketing clients — including several News Corp media outlets — “decode” personalities based on 24 set parameters, including language, cognition, susceptibility, and culture.","Despite years of effort and billions of international dollars, the Iraq and Afghanistan information operations (IO) projects were deemed by experts to have been a failure. Cdr Tatham even co-wrote a UK Defence Academy report lamenting “the corporate failure to adapt IO and PSYOPS’s operating practices to the 21st century, instead relying upon ages-old methods of communication,” as well as an “over reliance of IO and PSYOPS on commercial advertising and marketing strategies.”","“Commercial marketing and advertising methods are designed to increase the hit rate of customers in a target group. A conversion of 10% would be considered outstanding and highly profitable. But in military operations achieving a 10% change in the behaviour of an insurgent group or a hostile community would be operationally insignificant,” Tatham wrote in the NATO StratCom Target Audience Analysis (TAA) course summary. He instead advocates for TAA and the use of scientific research into behavior predictors, such as language, likes, and motivation, as opposed to focusing the majority of resources on creative media production glitz.","To this end, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), a trading fund of the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) which is the equivalent of USA’s DARPA, conducted a study between May-Sept 2013 called ‘Project DUCO’ which contracted SCL and BDi to test out their TAA capabilities. The evaluation was undertaken as part of the Human and Social Influence project, funded from the MoD Science and Technology research budget. In-person questionnaires were verbally completed by young unmarried males (“YUMs”) in target regions, with SCL-trained interviewers canvassing neighborhoods like standard solicitors, simply because no other means existed to gain insight into individual personalities and groupthink.","It seems that the psyops startup incubators of Iraq and Afghanistan failed to overwhelmingly win the hearts and minds of the target audiences in those locales, but succeeded in honing the methodological requirements of the IO traffickers. As Tatham suggested, giant billboards and radio jingles aimed at a large population based on small sample size indicators weren’t effective enough, so a product like Verbalisation — listed under “Counter Terrorism and Security” on R-Cloud, Dstl’s marketplace for partnered contractors — was born, ready and able to pinpoint individuals & target groups for analysis and alteration.","Of course, all of this sounds exactly like the TAA work SCL was contracted in early 2017 to perform for the US State Department’s new Global Engagement Center, a reboot of the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (CSCC) and its famously failed 2010s online propaganda & surveillance program.","SCL and State’s CSCC were not strangers prior to 2017, though, as Nigel Oakes had spoken at a January 2012 CSCC seminar on “The Most Common Mistakes in Designing Influence Campaigns,” at which Oakes was pitching the State Dept on knowledge acquired from Iraq and Afghan 15 POG work. The seminar’s BDi-provided video description explains, “Nigel highlighted four very common errors made in designing influence campaigns, especially if one is trying to induce significant behavior change.”","Bits and pieces of the 2000s Middle Eastern psyops extravaganza had trickled out back then, but the full extent of B-PC/BPPA’s Iraq work under Mark Turnbull was only revealed in a October 2016 report entitled “Fake News and False Flags” by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a UK nonprofit devoted to extended and unbiased investigations.","Five years previous, the Bureau conducted another well-publicized investigation into Turnbull’s BPPA, in which B-PC executives were caught on tape boasting about their unique “dark arts” ability to initiate political change via their deep infiltration into the highest levels of UK government. The execs also boasted of their skills in hiding bad PR by manipulating Google results with juiced-up ‘Google bombing’, and how they had a team devoted to Wikipedia reputation management, which is common now but was rather cutting-edge at the time.","NOT EXACTLY MAGGIE & GORBY","Also back in 2004 — the same year BPPA formed and their work began in Iraq — B-PC took on a contract to spin their web in Ukraine for Yulia Tymoshenko in the time of the Orange Revolution, which would have seen them working against Paul Manafort’s clients in the Party of Regions, as well as in the vicinity of fellow contractor SCL. A previous article published by TEXTIFIRE explored SCL’s role in those events and the related history, which involves billionaires, rigged elections, the most glamorous Russian spy in history, and a mythical war room SCL billed as “The Most Powerful Weapon In The World.”","Bell’s involvement in Ukraine did not end in 2004, for even though they had been employed by future Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, it was her frequent antagonist and Party of Regions bigwig Dmytro Firtash who retained the long-term services of B-PC. Firtash is an oil & natural resources magnate who also owns Ukraine’s largest TV station, but is now an internationally wanted criminal suspect trailing a long history of personal relationships with Vladimir Putin and Russian mobster Semion Mogilevich. Just as with the American PR firm Black, Manafort, Stone, and Atwater, whose client list is littered with objectively unsavory characters, Bell Pottinger has long made itself available to the highest bidder.","Bell advised the Firtash Foundation while Anthony Fisher, senior consultant with Bell Pottinger, served as director of the Foundation. Fisher also co-founded the Firtash front Scythian Limited, which came under fire for funneling foreign funds to Tory politicians in a scandal which prevented a National Security Adviser nominee from being confirmed, and is a board member of the Firtash-supported group British Ukrainian Society (BUS). Chairman of BUS is Lord Risby, an economics graduate of Cambridge University, former vice-chairman of the Conservative Party, and current member of the House of Lords.","Firtash’s direct ties to several well-placed UK Conservatives is a curiosity. Despite his heavy baggage, Firtash has stayed active in politics via his BUS, and he donated a truck full of cash to help establish Cambridge University’s Ukrainian Studies school. Perhaps his open checkbook and loose lips have allowed him to avoid extradition to the USA, instead roaming free in Vienna while out on US$125,000,000 bail from long-unprosecuted charges. Without speculating too much about his actual place in this tale, Firtash’s story in particular is reminiscent of the days of Reagan-Thatcher-Gorbachev era Cold War double agents.","What’s old is apparently new again, however, as the Parliamentary members of the short-lived group Conservative Friends of Russia would no doubt decline to attest. Conservative Friends rapidly fizzled after public outcry but quickly relaunched as the Westminster Russia Forum, yet those ex-Friends could be expected to assure us that their original so-called “Tories for Putin” group was strictly on the up and up.","As Friends co-founder Richard Royal explained at the time in his 2012 Guardian op-ed, the Tories had turned their backs on the more liberal Labour leadership but found their increasingly hardlining nativist gaze met in Eurasia. “We must remember, however, that being a Friend of Russia is not the same as being a Friend of the Russian government,” said Royal. “By that reckoning, our Conservative members were not friends of Britain between 1997 and 2010[.]”","Retro ’80s stylings abound, in fact, as Conservative bedfellow Lord Bell was nominated for his knighthood by Margaret Thatcher, for whom he served as personal media adviser throughout her time as UK Prime Minister, with their close friendship illustrated by Bell’s official announcement of her 2013 death.","The Iron Lady left behind quite the well-connected coterie, with her Atlantic Bridge co-founder Liam Fox overseeing the aforementioned psyops work while Shadow Defence Secretary & Defence Secretary from 2005–2011, his megadonor patron Michael Hintze a client of Lord Bell’s during the time of Atlantic Bridge, and old friend Sir Geoffrey Pattie — another former vice-chair of the Conservative party who served as Thatcher’s Minister of State for Industry & Information Technology and Undersecretary for Defence Procurement — spending a few years as a Director of SCL.","Though Sir Pattie had switched from Director to President of SCL Group four years prior, SCL Elections’ official registration in the month preceding President Obama’s reelection — with Mercer Money in its coffers and Lord Bell’s ‘Special Projects’ ex-director Mark Turnbull at its helm — set off a chain reaction of SCL corporate maneuverings that extended across the following four years.","A flurry of declarations of new subsidiaries and subsequent name changes of those companies culminated on 7 September 2016, when SCL Director Alexander Nix transferred all 100 original shares of SCL Elections from himself to the company SCL Analytics. Formed a year prior, SCL Analytics is 70% owned by Nix and 30% owned by its parent company SCL Group.","However, that CA-UK is technically separate from the American subsidiary Cambridge Analytica LLC, which was registered in Delaware on 31 Dec 2013, over two years sooner. To confuse us even further, 22 Apr 2014 saw the DE registration of SCL USA Inc., which is also wholly owned by SCL Elections but is separate from the 12 Feb 2003 establishment of SCL USA LLC.","If you followed all that, give yourself a pat on the back and a candy.","SEEKING A Ph.D. IN EXPLOITATIVE AD-TECH","Cambridge Analytica LLC — the US company which will henceforth be referred to as CA or CambAnal — has garnered a large amount of public interest over the last year and a half for its use of big data in elections, just like Rebekah Mercer wanted. The primary subject of that media attention has been debate over the controversial merits of CA’s claimed use of Five Factor Model or BIG5 personality profiling — aka OCEAN, an acronym derived from Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism — with much less of a focus on either the sourcing of the identifying datapoints or the origination of the tools & methodology CA deployed.","A December 2016 article in Das Magazin — a sensation in Germany at the time, which spread virally upon its English translation published by VICE’s Motherboard in January — told a story relayed by Michal Kosinski, formerly Director of Operations for Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre and Leader of the e-Psychometrics Unit. Kosinski seemed to be suggesting SCL and CA might have stolen (or at least repurposed without permission) his team’s research into third-party use of millions of Facebook interactions as data point items, which Kosinski et al collected using a Facebook quiz app and then ran through OCEAN profiling for personality cataloguing purposes.","Cambridge University played a major role in an earlier TEXTFIRE article, as it has become a hotbed of international spy chatter over the last several months, encompassing rumors about Gen. Michael Flynn and Russian influence at the renowned spycraft coffee klatch, the Cambridge Intelligence Seminar (where 15 POG’s Stephen Jolly is said to be a frequent attendee). Switching gears, however, it is important to note that Cambridge was partnering with another organization on this and other psychometrics projects: Microsoft Research.","At the time of his key March 2013 journal article, Kosinski was also a research advisor to the Online Services and Advertising group at Microsoft Research Cambridge. One of his two article co-authors was Dr. Thore Graepel, who “is a researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge leading the Online Services and Advertising and Applied Games group, where their work is focused on the application of large scale machine learning and probabilistic modelling techniques to a wide range of problems including online advertising, web search, and games,” according to his still-active Cambridge online profile.","Perhaps Cambridge simply needs to update its website, for Dr. Graepel currently works as Research Lead at Google DeepMind and Professor of Computer Science at University College London. DeepMind is a company Google purchased in 2014, which seeks to conquer quantum computing but now primarily develops “the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms,” and which has come under fire for its mishandling of millions of UK patients’ health data while under contract from Britain’s NHS.","The other significant co-author on that publication (and its several predecessors, starting in Feb 2012) was Dr David Stillwell, Deputy Director of The Psychometrics Centre, whose Cambridge profile labels the barely-30y/o as the “Mark Zuckerberg of Psychometrics.” Stillwell originally wrote the myPersonality app which gathered the studies’ data from millions of Facebook profiles, doing so while preparing for his graduate studies in 2007. Just one year after Facebook first became available to the general public, myPersonality began hoarding user profiles.","Stillwell also created a Facebook app called You Are What You Like, a product released no later than October 2013. “By linking the myPersonality database to Facebook Likes we have created an application that is able to predict your personality simply by logging in to your Facebook account,” boasted its deactivated Cambridge webpage.","Another tool developed from myPersonality (and its cousin myIQ) was LikeAudience, described in the 2010–11 annual Cambridge report as “a breakthrough research and marketing tool developed by Michal Kosinski that provides detailed psycho-demographic profiles of brands, products, ideas, and all the other things people like on Facebook.”","The Psychometrics Centre was working on “gender difference in intelligence” and “perceptions of intelligence in Facebook images and their relationship to actual IQ and to personality, the validity of social network likes as predictors of product preference and the relationship between personality and product preference,” the report went on to say. “Michal Kosinski established a continuing collaboration with the Microsoft Laboratory at Cambridge, on several projects including an exploration of crowd sourcing of intelligence in the Amazon Mechanical Turk.”","“Never before have we had access to such comprehensive behavioural data about consumers,” said Kosinski in a 22 Apr 2011 article by Cambridge. “We think [LikeAudience] will revolutionise marketing, because it introduces a completely new dimension by adding scientifically robust personality tests to other demographic information.”","The same article announced Kosinski and Stillwell “believe that [LikeAudience] will be of particular value to marketers, who will be able to uncover new potential audiences for their advertising campaigns, and exploitable niches based on the fans of their closest rivals. The potential significance for politicians, particularly when on the election trail, is also clear.”","Identifying politics and elections as potential use case scenarios has been a common theme with these products. The “How Does It Work?” page on YouAreWhatYouLike.com posited, “If most of the things you like are liked by liberal people (e.g. Quentin Tarantino) — it is quite likely that you are also liberal.”","“Sarah Palin appeals to a rather different personality type. Her followers are likely to be more traditional in mindset, disciplined, dutiful, and older than the average Obama fan.” Further analysis of Palin-approving LikeAudience users found those with similar profiles “still track the fortunes of the last President, George W. Bush, and also enthuse about Pizza Hut and the Seattle Seahawks.”","PreferenceTool, the successor of the deprecated LikeAudience, seems quite sure of its efficacy in applying all this knowledge to behavioural modification. “PreferenceTool enables marketers to significantly improve targeting and reduce the cost of marketing campaigns,” said its splash page. “It is used by leading online marketing agencies and is proved to have increased campaign effectiveness by up to 140%. [emphasis theirs]”","Despite an outward veneer of academically pure intention, this research is clearly being conducted for specific purposes. To get a better sense of their work, Cambridge has helpfully provided us with a litany of online demonstrations of what appears to be its currently most hyped [and administratively sanctioned] product, the online psychometric assessment creation tool Concerto. We can quickly see the difference between Cambridge Psychometric’s historical topics of focus, such as preschool activities and mental disorders, as compared to the names of quizzes performed in Concerto, including several titled “Advertisement Test”.","Both the Psychometrics Centre and Microsoft Research websites plainly hawk their myPersonality-derived services to interested clients, using keywords of ‘advertising’ and ‘machine learning’. Cambridge offers the use of myPersonality data as a service, on both the Psychometrics homepage and and its flagship Apply Magic Sauce site, and also offers open-source data to hundreds of active researchers at myPersonality.org.","Apply Magic Sauce hosts a sample personality quiz, which likely distracts rubberneckers more interested in the self-help quizzes found on Cambridge’s DiscoverMyProfile.com, but its business2business page boasts of services which will sound very familiar if you’ve read this far. “We enable instant psychological assessment of your users based on their online behaviour,” it excitedly exclaims, by using a range of tools “from multi-channel keyword targeting to psycholinguistic tailoring.”","“In a fraction of a second, you can now adjust the presentation, delivery and content of your message to suit the distinct psychological make-up of the person viewing it,” if you are simply willing to pay a few hundred or thousand quid per month, depending on the extent of your customised needs. To be clear, Cambridge University’s publicly available Apply Magic Sauce product is openly offering to perform high-frequency advertisement creation based on psychographic profiling data culled from Facebook, in what is likely a very lucrative setup for the school.","On the private sector side, “Online Services and Advertising and Applied Games group” sounds rather self-explanatory, so it is relatively clear what Microsoft has intended to accomplish through its Cambridge funding. Microsoft Research Cambridge (MSRC) research is being funneled into Microsoft’s Cortana AI tool and its Azure Cognitive Services AI platform, as well as “voting games” and internet ads. An MSRC study from Sept 2014 is titled “Efficient Advert Assignment”, focusing on algorithmic pay-per-click schemes in online search results.","“Only in the recent literature have computationally efficient methods been considered for market and auction design,” the paper reminds us. “In the context of electronic commerce and specifically sponsored search auctions, these computational considerations are of critical importance given the increased diversity and competition associated with online advertising.”","Cambridge and Microsoft’s team-up has produced algorithm-to-algorithm HFT of consumers’ personalities and their custom-targeted online adverts. No wonder the Psychometrics Centre changed departments in 2016, moving from Social and Developmental Psychology to Stephen Jolly’s Judge Business School.","TAKING THE CAMBRIDGE OUT OF CAMBANAL","With fingers pointing at CambAnal and CambUni as a result of all the recent media coverage, blame has begun to be shifted around. School, tech company, and professors are all turning on each other. In an attempt to uncover their true relationships, data protection advocate and researcher Paul-Olivier Dehaye has filed a number of Freedom Of Information requests with Cambridge, but has thus far only received refusals; instead, the University has appeared to be attempting to distance itself from the research in question. Their stance seems to be that they have no claim to the data or results, that Michal Kosinski owns it all, and that Microsoft is solely responsible for its existence.","In the aforementioned Das Magazin article, Kosinski absolved himself and Cambridge of any responsibility, saying, “This is not my fault. I did not build the bomb. I only showed that it exists.” He instead laid nearly all the blame at the feet of a young Cambridge professor, then known as Dr Aleksandr Kogan. Kosinski said Kogan approached him in late January 2014, attempting to purchase access to myPersonality on behalf of a deep-pocketed company, and it was not until some time later that Kosinski remembered it was SCL. Kogan went on to start his own company and began harvesting Facebook information from unsuspecting Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, paying the going rate of pennies per full profile download, and then turned that info over to SCL in some sort of licensing deal.","In a public Facebook conversation, Kogan denies almost all of this. He says he and Kosinski knew each other and continued to stay in touch after SCL entered the frame; SCL also met and had direct interactions with Kosinski; and SCL was by that time heavily into machine learning and microtargeting applications of psychological data for political purposes.","As he noted in his lengthy Facebook rebuttal, Kogan legally changed his married name to Aleksandr Spectre in 2016, making him Dr Spectre. He only has a small handful of published papers to his name(s), focused exclusively on emotionality neuroscience, though that didn’t stop him from becoming Director aka “beloved commander” of the Cambridge Prosociality and Well-Being Lab as early as July 2013. His full birth name was Aleksandr Borisovich Kogan, owing to his Moldovan birth and Russian ancestry.","As easy as it would be to cast the Russian mad scientist Dr Spectre as the villain in this British spy story, the problem is Kosinski’s timeline doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.","The word on the street is CambAnal hired researchers from Cambridge University as part of its original staff, which is allegedly where the “Cambridge” came from when naming the company on its first 31 Dec 2013 Delaware registration, along with the perceived instant name cachet. But that this would be less than a month before Spectre allegedly approached Kosinski on behalf of SCL — or before SCL met Kosinski — is an enormous coincidence, especially since the Psychometric Centre’s Facebook-related research publications and marketing products had been making the rounds for 3–5 years at that point.","Not to mention, the first pre-CA “unpaid pilot project to show how SCL might work” for electioneering purposes was in the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial race, which culminated on 5 Nov 2013. What was their ‘value add’ in mid/late 2013 if SCL was merely offering UK military psyops techniques (as described in our companion article), if Cambridge Analytica and its fancy-sounding name wouldn’t be officially established until two months later, and if they weren’t testing out any BIG5 methodology or offering up psycho-demographic profile data from Facebook?","Of course, it’s possible these shortcomings contributed to their candidate Ken Cuccinelli’s loss, despite another $600,000 of Mercer Money given to Cuccinelli supporters at Virginia Principles Fund, which is the only donation ever listed for that PAC. Perhaps they emerged from the losing battle with a better sense of their big data needs, but as the next few years unfolded, this model where Mercer donates to a campaign or PAC just prior to Cambridge Analytica’s employment would quickly become de rigueur.","Cuccinelli, who would later advise Ted Cruz, said he met Mercer on a fundraising trip to New York. “He’s very solid and understated. You wouldn’t know you were talking to someone with that kind of force,” said Cuccinelli. “He just thinks our country is off track and he’s in a position to do something to get it back on track.”","It’s unlikely CambAnal/SCL was the reason for the recent FBI raid of Strategic Campaign Group, a firm which also worked for Cuccinelli’s 2013 campaign and the Mercer-funded/CA-assisted John Bolton SuperPAC. Still, it’s unclear if SCL was legally allowed to do unpaid electioneering work in 2013, since SCL USA LLC’s 12 Feb 2003 Delaware establishment as a defense contractor made it the only American SCL subsidiary in existence at that time. And why is SCL USA LLC currently listed as a Foreign Company in VA records if it’s registered to Steve Bannon’s Beverly Hills business address…?","After recommending that the Mercers fund the startup SCL Elections in 2012, which was the major catalyst for the creation of CambAnal, Steve Bannon continued his push into UK affairs. He flew to England in late 2013 to meet with Raheem Kassam, a young far-right blogger and frequent thinktank employee. Bannon invited him to guide the hand of the upcoming Breitbart London bureau expansion site, which Kassam agreed to do.","Breitbart London successfully launched in February 2014 and began working surprising magic on the fortunes of UKIP, which would gain its biggest head of steam yet as it made huge gains in Parliamentary seats and pushed for an exit of Britain from the EU. This seems to be partially due to Kassam’s positioning as Bannon’s UK avatar. Kassam not only tirelessly supported the cause on Breitbart, but switched his voting allegiance from Conservative to UKIP at the time Bannon visited in 2013, and then suddenly rose to become UKIP leader Nigel Farage’s chief of staff in 2014.","Unfortunately for Farage’s bizarrely alleged good friend Robert Mercer, this was a few months before Renaissance Technologies would again be mentioned in the halls of Capitol Hill.","MR. MERCER GOES TO WASHINGTON","On 22 July 2014, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, led by US Senators Carl Levin (D) and John McCain (R), held a hearing titled, “Abuse of Structured Financial Products: Misusing Basket Options to Avoid Taxes and Leverage Limits.” Called in to testify were six financial heavyweights: the Managing Director of Barclays, the CEO of Barclays Capital, a Managing Director and the President of Deutsche Bank Securities, and two executives from Renaissance Technologies.","After a 6-year investigation, the firms were being accused of nearly 15 years of tax evasion through the use of “basket contracts” aka “basket options”, which are too complicated to necessitate a full explanation in this space. The end result is the conversion of short-term trading profits into long-term capital gains, which lowered the tax rate on their gains/profits from 35% to 15%, saving RenTec et al billions of dollars in taxes.","Using algorithms written to identify and exploit opportunities for statistical arbitrage — aka StatArb, which focuses on tiny and very brief pricing anomalies of publicly-traded assets, which occur for various reasons and are only visible to computers — Rentec would execute more than 100 thousand trades a day, and more than 30 million a year. Deutsche and Barclays then assisted RenTec and two hedge funds in covering up the digital paper trail, skirting the outermost edges of the tax law in the process.","This type of high frequency trading is among many different strategies that act as one, including the implementation of machine-learning technologies to make and implement investment decisions. In contrast to algorithms that make short-term market forecasts, incredibly powerful computer arrays use big data to look far into the future, continually buying and selling securities based on those predictions. To power this, RenTec developed its own programming language to run those modeling systems. Medallion Fund, its most profitable fund — perhaps the most profitable in the world, though it’s open only to RenTec employees — includes several million lines of code in its algorithmic instructions.","As RenTec founder Dr Jim Simons — the 2nd largest Democratic donor in 2016 and one of the first people Barack Obama visited in his first post-presidential trip to NYC — once said, “It’s 100% automated. It’s as automated as it can be. The computer does its thing. It generates its trade, and the trade gets executed. No one sticks its head to the door, and says: ‘Jeez! You should buy IBM!’ We couldn’t model that.”","Big winners in HFT need the best computers, the most bandwidth, and the closest proximity to stock exchanges in order to maximize their chances of finding exploits, but this is all much more useful when combined with constantly refreshed input on the state of the planet’s activities. RenTec is said to maintain one of the largest data troves in the world, compiling information on every bit or byte they can get their hands on. Just as with BlackRock, another financial firm with incredible success leveraging big data & information surveillance due to their decades-old data facility in Washington State and ten more elsewhere, the storage of eclectic trivia empowers their algorithms to make decisions based on all available data points & variables.","As Dr Peter Brown, Robert Mercer’s co-CEO and co-President testified in front of McCain, “We collect all the publicly available data we can find that we believe might bear on the movement of the prices of tradable instruments — news stories, analysts’ reports, energy reports, crop reports, weather reports, regulatory filings, accounting data, and, of course, quotes and trades from markets around the world. Our models use this data to make predictions about future price changes.”","Another huge source of the information constantly being compiled by enormous data warehouses like these comes from private distributors of pure social media output, known as the Firehose. Facebook and Twitter are the most important generators of this info flow, but nearly all social media companies make their raw data streams available for harvesting and analysis. A slew of companies have offered paid access to view the mountains of data via slick interfaces, as well as feed into hungry algorithms. All of these online interactions are near-instantly categorized, contextualized, and transformed into stock trades and/or ad purchases.","Mercer hoards his chips","Despite all this money constantly changing hands, which is encoded in law as an important event for tax purposes, between 2010 — the midterm election cycle year when Republicans & Tea Partiers took control of the House of Representatives — and 2014, the I.R.S. budget dropped by almost $2 billion in real terms, or nearly 15 percent. Just to reiterate, RenTec is thought to have kept over $6,000,000,000 in tax money away from the I.R.S. and federal government simply through the use of basket contract schemes, which was then paid out to RenTec employees and funneled back into the coffers of the ad & PR agencies who work for Citizens United v FEC-enabled SuperPACs.","Nothing much came of the McCain hearing, except suggestions by the I.R.S. in 2015 that basket contracts would come under scrutiny, before backing off of that threat a few months later. Hillary Clinton had proposed HFT taxes as part of her platform, which may help explain Mercer’s hatred of her, and the loopholes may get another look this year, possibly maybe, but not if Robert Mercer or his friends in the White House have anything to say about it. Any rage over the embarrassment of RenTec’s perceived persecution in 2014—later more fully addressed through the funding of an opposing GOP candidate in McCain’s next Senate race — found an easy outlet that summer, as Cambridge Analytica LLC added psychographic profiles to the data warehouses and high-frequency personality trading algorithms finally became operational.","A landmark moment for CambAnal arrived a month before the RenTec hearing, as it was rewarded for all of its convoluted preparation when it received its first publicly recorded paycheck on June 10th, 2014: $20,000 for working on urine hoarder Art Robinson’s third attempt to unseat HFT critic Peter DeFazio in Oregon. The two PACs which donated enough to Robinson to cover that bill were America Inc ($21,000), run by conservative media activist L. Brent Bozell, and Ending Spending Action Fund ($732,712), which received $1.75m of Mercer Money during the 2014 election cycle.","It has recently been revealed that June was CA’s first claimed month with its heavyweight Vice President/Secretary, who is primarily known as the former stock trader, Pentagon employee, executive chairman of the most influential online news outlet of the past few years, and Tea Party & Brexit supporter extraordinaire who initially helped kickstart SCL as it rolled down its current path. All of this describes just one person: Mr Stephen K. Bannon.","CATCHING UP TO THE PRESENT TENSION","Steve Bannon — the current White House Chief Strategist who still attends National Security Council meetings, as of this article’s publication date — has owned at least a hefty chunk of Cambridge Analytica LLC, the Facebook-powered, international military psyops-based, Mercer-funded, Microsoft-enabled, finance-loopholed, Amazon-trained, far-right-affiliated, foreign-born, algorithmic-advertising-driven media machine which participated in both the victorious Brexit and Donald Trump campaigns.","In fact, Bannon is the only publicly documented shareholder/owner of Cambridge Analytica LLC to date. Every SCL subsidiary in the UK has reported their shareholders on a regular basis for public dissemination, as is the lawful standard, but similar information is generally not available in the US. As a result of Bannon’s required White House financial disclosures, however, we learned he owned between $1m-$5m in CambAnal, though in defiance of legality he had not sold it as of at least late April 2017.","Now, there is no shortage of marketing & PR agencies looking to exploit technology for political or financial gain, as evidenced by a private psychological operations firm-for-hire like Bell Pottinger, British Army psyops-based Verbalisation, or any number of boutique advertising startups. Even frequent GOP candidate vendor Campaign Solutions did so back in 2014 for the radically right wing John Bolton SuperPAC, which received $4m of Robert Mercer’s money between Apr 2014-Sep 2016.","Their job was to help microtarget DirectTV advertisements by cross-checking state voter files with consumer data such as magazine subscriptions, so the voters could then be sorted into 100 personality types, arranged into 28 clusters, and sent a specific version of a political ad tailored to each of those clusters through their satellite TV. This was a far cry from SCL’s in-person questionnaires of mere hundreds of YUMs for UK’s MoD, but Cambridge Analytica was also hired to work closely with Campaign Solutions on the 2014 campaigns to create those varying TV ads. In 2015 & 2016, CambAnal was repeatedly contracted by John Bolton SuperPAC to work with Connell Donatelli, which shares an owner with Campaign Solutions, to produce more targeted ads.","Even so, when Bannon’s CambAnal later joined Trump’s GOP data team in employing the same high-speed AI advertising and algorithmic purchasing strategies laid out by Microsoft, Cambridge University, Verbalisation, and even RenTec while partnering with Facebook & Google’s ad deployment platforms during the 2016 elections, it was a very big deal. Here we had highly motivated, massively funded, ideologically driven, career specialist military, psychology, and technology minds from both sides of the Atlantic working closely together to achieve specific outcomes at any cost.","For example, Liam Fox is the first-ever UK Secretary of State for International Trade, despite all of his outrageous behavior just a few short years ago. Apparently someone who profits off of private deals with international military contractors, all while taking a government paycheck to represent the public’s best interests, is exactly who should be in charge of Trade as Britain prepares to exit the European Union. Brexit’s success paved the way for Fox to triumphantly reclaim his lost power, which makes his role clear.","Brexit kingpin and former financial trader Nigel Farage was invited to speak at Heritage Foundation in 2015, along with Roger Helmer & other UKIP “Patriotic Voices from Europe”, delivering a barrage of Obama attacks to the delight of the crowd. In fact, Farage’s Leave campaigns were entirely unafraid of identifying their friends across the pond, as evidenced by the namecheck in Go Movement Ltd’s (GML) application for Leave designation: “GML will further coordinate with the Heritage Foundation and other think tanks that support an EU referendum, which will provide a strong ‘outside’ voice within the echo chamber.” Predictably, the director of Heritage’s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom is elated about Brexit.","Heritage Foundation was credited with formulating the exact blueprint for Trump’s first 100 days, which mostly worked perfectly (if we can agree its true intent was to deconstruct the administrative state). Even its slight failure might explain why President Jim DeMint was recently ousted, after which time Steve Bannon was floated as a replacement candidate. Things are now looking like they might go very bad in the Trump administration, but the suggestion that a White House Chief Strategist would leave that post for a thinktank should clarify the extent of Heritage’s power and influence. Rebekah Mercer’s placement as a strong Heritage board member, along with her donations of millions of Mercer Money, is likely stoking the coals under a Bannon-Heritage matchup.","Club for Growth, which has received at least $2,000,000 of Mercer Money since 2011, is welcoming the new administration with open arms. Vice President Mike Pence gave a speech at the Spring 2017 Club event on 19 March, in which he mentioned Tea Partiers Pat Toomey & Mike Lee by name and regaled the crowd with stories of the Club’s strong support for Pence since way back in 2000.","Atlantic Bridge’s former partner ALEC has also filled the halls of the US government and especially the White House, with supporters, donation recipients, and members running the show at the highest possible level. Those names include CIA chief Mike Pompeo, EPA head Scott Pruitt, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, United Nations representative Nikki Haley, and — wait for it — VP Mike Pence.","Renaissance Technologies is a legend in the trading industry, partially because they have consistently been pioneers of automated financial prediction. In 2017, human quants across the market spectrum are being increasingly laid off and replaced by AI & algorithms. Machine learning is so prevalent in finance, with so much more predictive power than humans, that HFT and algos are the new normal. However, Robert Mercer is poised to dominate the industry with RenTec’s new HFT-killing patent, which will essentially elbow out all but the largest black box houses, leaving him King of FinTech.","These are the people that profited from techniques and software honed by the world’s largest militaries and tech corporations, merging media production intended to craft weapons out of art with… well, actually that perfectly describes both psyops and advertising, but merging those with total information awareness and special access to the control panels of the ubiquitous technologies used by billions of people. Theirs is the money that flowed freely in the wake of the Citizens United ruling, and that money has steered the conversations that buoyed their ascendancy.","At least two more enormous components to their success were glossed over in these pages, and we didn’t even get a chance to talk about the entire situation’s legality.","Amazingly, there is still so much more story to tell.","Stay tuned to TEXTIFIRE to catch up on the events of the last three years!","Thank you for reading and thanks to all the sourced researchers & artists.","NOTE: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that an Aleksandr Kogan who was the chief of a physiology school in Russia and has a neurocybernetics lab named after him is not the former Dr Spectre’s grandfather, according to Dr Kogan. We deeply regret the error."],"isopubdate":"2017-05-19"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S.

But Facebook was already doing this surreptitiously on some Android devices until October 2017, exploiting the way an older Android API handled permissions.","[Update, March 25, 2018, 20:24 Eastern Time]: Facebook has responded to this and other reports regarding the collection of call and SMS data with a blog post that denies Facebook collected call data surreptitiously. The company also writes that it never sells the data and that users are in control of the data uploaded to Facebook. This \"fact check\" contradicts several details Ars found in analysis of Facebook data downloads and testimony from users who provided the data. More on the Facebook response is appended to the end of the original article below.","This past week, a New Zealand man was looking through the data Facebook had collected from him in an archive he had pulled down from the social networking site. While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered something distressing: Facebook also had about two years' worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone, including names, phone numbers, and the length of each call made or received.","This experience has been shared by a number of other Facebook users who spoke with Ars, as well as independently by us—my own Facebook data archive, I found, contained call-log data for a certain Android device I used in 2015 and 2016, along with SMS and MMS message metadata.","Calls I made to my office number to check my voicemail, and from my office number to find my phone, found in my Facebook data archive. In total, there were two years of call data, from the period I used my Blackphone as my primary phone.","To retrieve a .zip file of your Facebook data, go to the Settings page on Facebook and click the link circled in this screen shot.","In response to an email inquiry by Ars about this data gathering, a Facebook spokesperson replied, \"The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.\"","The spokesperson pointed out that contact uploading is optional and installation of the application explicitly requests permission to access contacts. And users can delete contact data from their profiles using a tool accessible via Web browser.","Further Reading","Facebook uses phone-contact data as part of its friend recommendation algorithm. And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android and Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for access to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But even if users didn't give that permission to Messenger, they may have given it inadvertently for years through Facebook's mobile apps—because of the way Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past. (For Facebook's instructions on turning off continuous contact uploading, go here. )","If you granted permission to read contacts during Facebook's installation on Android a few versions ago—specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)—that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. From Android 4.1 on, a single request from those applications would trigger two separate permission requests.","But until the \"Marshmallow\" version of Android, even with split permissions, all permissions could still be presented all at once, without users getting the option to decline them individually. So Facebook and other applications could continue to gain access to call and SMS data with a single request by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Starting with Marshmallow, users could toggle these permissions separately themselves. But as many as half of Android users worldwide remain on older versions of the operating system because of carrier restrictions on updates or other issues.","Apple iOS has never allowed access to call log data by third-party apps, overt or silently, so this sort of data acquisition was never possible.","Facebook provides a way for users to purge collected contact data from their accounts, but it's not clear if this deletes just contacts or if it also purges call and SMS metadata. After purging my contact data, my contacts and calls were still in the archive I downloaded the next day—likely because the archive was not regenerated for my new request. (Update: The cached archive was generated once and not updated on the second request. However, two days after a request to delete all contact data, the contacts were still listed by the contact management tool.)","As always, if you're really concerned about privacy, you should not share address book and call-log data with any mobile application. And you may want to examine the rest of what can be found in the downloadable Facebook archive, as it includes all the advertisers that Facebook has shared your contact information with, among other things.","Update, March 25, 2018, continued:","Facebook responded to reports that it collected phone and SMS data without users' knowledge in a \"fact check\" blog post on Sunday. In the response, a Facebook spokesperson stated:","Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provide you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.","This contradicts the experience of several users who shared their data with Ars. Dylan McKay told Ars that he installed Messenger in 2015, but only allowed the app the permissions in the Android manifest that were required for installation. He says he removed and reinistalled the app several times over the course of the next few years, but never explicitly gave the app permission to read his SMS records and call history. McKay's call and SMS data runs through July of 2017.","In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used. Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.","While data collection was technically \"opt-in,\" in both these cases the opt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook's application, not a separate notification of data collection. Facebook never explicitly revealed that the data was being collected, and it was only discovered as part of a review of the data associated with the accounts. The users we talked to only performed such reviews after the recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data.","Facebook began explicitly asking permission from users of Messenger and Facebook Lite to access SMS and call data to \"help friends find each other\" after being publicly shamed in 2016 over the way it handled the \"opt-in\" for SMS services. That message mentioned nothing about retaining SMS and call data, but instead it offered an \"OK\" button to approve \"keeping all of your SMS messages in one place.\"","Facebook says that the company keeps the data secure and does not sell it to third parties. But the post doesn't address why it would be necessary to retain not just the numbers of contacts from phone calls and SMS messages, but the date, time, and length of those calls for years.","Sean Gallagher\nSean is Ars Technica's IT and National Security Editor.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The March 24 statement appeared after media stories last week about revelations from Chris Wylie, a data scientist from Victoria who described how he helped SCL Group and its offshoot company Cambridge Analytica gain access to the personal data of 50 million Facebook users and connect it to their psychological profiles.","Cambridge Analytica worked on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign while AggregateIQ gained notoriety for its work for the leave side which narrowly won the 2016 Brexit referendum.","“AggregateIQ has never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL,” the AggregateIQ statement said. “Aggregate IQ has never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica. Chris Wylie has never been employed by AggregateIQ.”","Wylie had been the research director at SCL and has been quoted saying that while the companies were separate, they worked so closely that people at SCL referred to AggregateIQ as its Canadian department. The companies shared the same underlying technology, he has said.","SCL Group describes itself on its website as “the global leader in data-driven communications.” The private firm specializes in data mining and data analysis, using the results to target key audiences in hopes of modifying their behaviours. According to its website it has done work for governments and military organizations around the world and has worked to influence elections in 19 countries, including Italy, India, South Africa, Colombia, Indonesia, Thailand and the United Kingdom.","While AggregateIQ’s statement says it never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica, it’s been on the public record that it did have a relationship with Cambridge’s parent company SCL since The Tyee reported it more than a year ago.","“We sub-contracted work to them, such as software development and digital marketing (before we built up our own in-house capacity in these areas),” an SCL spokesman told The Tyee via email in March 2017. “They also acted as a local point-of-contact in Canada for SCL. That business relationship ended and we haven’t worked with them for quite a while.”","Until February 2017, SCL had listed a Canadian office in Victoria, the phone number for which was answered by Zack Massingham, AggregateIQ’s CEO, even after the listing had been removed from SCL’s website.","“It was recently brought to our attention that their contact details were still on the website so we updated the page by removing them,” the SCL spokesman said a year ago. “SCL/Cambridge Analytica had no involvement whatsoever with their reported work with the Vote Leave campaign.”","For Massingham’s part, he said AggregateIQ had done work for SCL in the past, but the relationship had ended. “I don’t know why they recently had us listed as one of their worldwide offices, but other than the work we had done in the past, we do not have any current business with them,” he said at the time.","Jeff Silvester, AggregateIQ’s chief operating officer, did not respond to The Tyee’s request for comment this week.","Former Liberal candidate Penn said Wylie, who would have been 18 years old at the time, volunteered on her campaign. “He was around. I don’t even know exactly what he did,” she said.","Ray Larson, who was the communications director on Penn’s campaign, later went to London to work for SCL with Wylie.","Silvester was the executive assistant to Keith Martin, the Liberal incumbent in 2008 in a neighbouring riding, and Penn remembers him working closely to support her campaign.","“I can’t believe they didn’t know each other very well,” Penn said. “They were all milling around... I don’t blame any of these people for what they’re doing. They’re just making a living. The crime is we don’t have any regulations.”","Penn’s campaign manager in 2008 was Kit Spence, who along with strategist Brad Zubyk had worked in the Ukraine for Viktor Yanukovych and his pro-Russian Party of Regions. Also advising Yanukovych’s campaign was Paul Manafort, who would later become Trump’s campaign chair.","On Tuesday, Wylie told a British parliament committee that he “absolutely” believed AggregateIQ used Cambridge Analytica’s databases in its work during the Brexit referendum. According to the Associated Press’s report, Wylie said AggregateIQ “can do virtually everything that [Cambridge Analytica] can do but with a different billing name.”","Stone Leadership Campaign Hired Online Company That Helped Win Brexit","Reports Monday alleged that leave supporters had circumvented spending limits by co-ordinating more than one group to spend money on targeted advertising with AggregateIQ.","The statement on AggregateIQ’s website says, “All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client.” It also says it is and has always been Canadian owned and operated. “AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates. It has never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity.”","Penn lost in the 2008 election to Conservative Gary Lunn, but there were lingering questions about strange automated phone calls and the co-ordination of third party advertisers.","“I see in one little place the breeding ground for an issue of international proportions,” Penn said. “If you’re a professional political operative, in 2008 you saw how easy it was to use analytics and crude tools to interfere with an election.","“It sensitized a group of people, like me, to ‘we need reform.’ But it sensitized a group of operatives they needed to up their ante if they were going to win elections for their clients.”","The experience in 2008 showed the need for stronger laws to protect democracy, Penn said. “Nobody in Ottawa’s been listening.

{"originalurl":"https://digitalrobberbarons.wordpress.com/2018/03/28/facebook-privacy-and-us-uk/","title":"Facebook, privacy and us (UK) – Digital Robber Barons","text":["Facebook, privacy and us (UK)","“Theft” and misuse of data by Facebook is a feature and not a bug","I was part of a team that built a prototype Facebook as part of the U.K. Government Cybrarian digital inclusion project in 2001. We designed it so that users owned their own data. We could have easily built the full platform (Fujitsu had won the tendering process and built the prototype), which we dubbed an “Amazon for e-gov” because, as one of the team (Graham) cautioned us, the government wouldn’t get what we building unless we could summarise it in an elevator pitch.","We had built a “social network” but that term wasn’t in common currency then, so we didn’t have a clearly understood term with which to describe our work. Amazon was in reasonably wide-spread use then, although not by anyone in government who, at that time, were still describing 21st century media literacy as “the ability to use the red button on the TV remote”. Cybrarian was evaluated by the management consultancy advising the government, at a cost of £4.5m, that this prototype was a “search engine.” So a search engine was built by learndirect with the £1.6m left in the budget. But a UK social network, where users owned their data, did not get built back in 2002/3 as it could have been. The Cybrarian technical team formed lastfridaymob to discuss how government should behave in the digital age.","Privacy. With our UK welfare state, public-service ethos mentality we had started from the position that the user, the citizen (?), owned their own data. We spent a lot of time modelling that user-owned data model, ending up with 5 levels of privacy and, given the pornographic nature of much content on the web, 3 levels of content access categories. In our model users owned their data and decided on how much to reveal and who they might reveal it to. We also had to pro-actively design for many use states across the welfare state including GPs, hospitals and prisons (for resettlement). However we were starting from the point of offering self-organised, socially inclusive, education and then broadened our concerns out to include various activities citizens might be interested in organising in digital community centres, or supporting online. This covered the whole range of informal learning processes including setting up special interest groups (like Facebook Groups) and finding people with similar experiences and interests to you (from prompts) in order to create new learning, or other, groups. This is very similar to how social groups and movements have always organised themselves so we were effectively designing for a digital version of Civil Society.","I realised we needed to design an Information Architecture for Civil Society if we were to build social networks not networked business systems. Public technologies were then (and now) being built using a business information architecture, as I’d warned in 1996 after creating a course called Business Uses of the Internet (or e-commerce before the term existed). That is, the systems being built for use in the public domain had the same underpinning information record structure as commercial business information systems, because that’s what contractors knew how, and were trained, to build. They used traditional business taxonomies to create information records based on the traditional commercial assumption of users being customers to whom you sell things.","However we could be creating new digital record structures that we own, and that reflect civil society, by using folksonomies based on user-generated tagging (as this WordPress blogging tool does). I’d worked on a DfES project called “Metadata for Community Content” researching this. In which case we would define how we are represented on the web and we would also decide how much of our self-definition we would share with others, in which circumstances, and for which purpose. Technically very easy. Building commercial systems is very easy (the other way) as we’ve seen. What happens online is all about standards and protocols, such as net neutrality. Politically very complicated to regulate, because our politicians have no idea what they are talking about and we, as citizens, have no idea how to engage in the participatory democratic processes (thanks to our taxonomy-driven schooling) that would help shape a social web that suits us rather than tech giants.","As Eli Pariser pointed out in “The Filter Bubble” back in 2012 (subtitle “what the Internet is hiding from you“) tech giants prefer to define you for search purposes in ways that suit their preference to be able to sell you as a definable product to advertisers. So your user interactions on social technologies are shaped by your advertising value. As Jaron Lanier pointed out in Who Owns The Future we could share in the revenue generated by our value to advertisers. I profoundly disagree with him as I didn’t grow up with advertising-funded American commercial TV and I want a different information architecture for the participatory web. But sharing in revenues we generate is perhaps a way of getting to the participatory web I prefer.","There is no technical problem in allowing users (citizens) to own the data that defines them online. It’s either a political issue (in the UK or the EU) or a commercial one (in the USA), or both. Obviously the American Mark Zuckerberg in digitising the already existing physical facebook offered to students at Harvard (his alma mater like Bill Gates) decided he would own users data, not least because he stored it on his servers. In our model your data sits in your digital space and you allow it to be used, encrypted, as and when it is needed. Zuckerberg didn’t invent anything he just e-enabled an already existing print-based product. All Facebook and the tech giants have done is build business information systems on the social web that are “always closing” on an infinite loop, because your data is always sitting there on their servers for 24/7 exploitation by them.","Privacy settings are a choice in any technology that uses personal data. Google had already corrupted this choice by deciding it would sell targeted online advertising to its users, and becoming billionaires in the process. They call this disruption, a term coined by the economist Schumpeter to describe how capitalism re-invents itself, but now used as the essence of cool by digital hipsters everywhere. Zuckerberg wanted the same wealth and later recruited Sheryl Sandberg from Google. In fact tech CEOs always want to become billionaires, which means rerouting revenues into their technology space. Their only value is wealth and they have no interest in ethics, especially any ethical issues that would separate them from greater wealth. Look at Elon Musk creating space junk out of his old car.","My observation, as someone who has been working with the participatory affordances of digital technologies since the 1980s (see Homi & the NeXT One from 1989), is that the Southern California tech giants have instead chosen to recreate online the commercial TV that pacified them in their childhood; content plagued by advertising. After all any culture reproduces itself first before it gets round to doing anything different. Given the tools to build an Architecture of Participation they have chosen to build an Architecture of Greed. Which is now becoming a global requirement as the tech giants groom us, in order to sell ourselves in the ways that make them the most money. We all have to feed their endless greed.","“Theft” and misuse of personal data is a feature not a bug of Facebook. You could argue that The Social Network (as Aaron Sorkin coolly characterised Facebook) was essentially benign in connecting people socially until the recent redesign (2015?) that changed the search default from people you knew to sticky content they wanted you to read; turns out that #fakenews is particularly sticky content. Facebook then became a media platform trying to point you at content it could monetise rather than connect you with your friends, as a social network should do, and as it began.","On privacy we have a choice. Let tech giants and other corporates build taxonomies defining us and then process that as #bigdata with which to manipulate us. Or learn how to define ourselves using Folksonomies and then use participative technologies to define our own futures. Folksonomy not Taxonomy","Baby you’re a rich man, and a very greedy boy; youngest billionaire on the planet.","Fred Garnett 28th March 2018 I’ve been writing about how a digital society might look in the 21st century after 2021 ever since 1984.","Advertisements","Share this:","Like this:","LikeLoading...","Published by fred6368","Visiting Researcher at the London Knowledge Lab\nMember of the Learner-Generated Contexts Group\nSocial Improv & #Heutagogy\nContextualist & CyberSalonista\nParticipatory City\nBeatles & World Music Fan\nWorking on #WikiQuals\nView all posts by fred6368","1 thought on “Facebook, privacy and us (UK)”","Sadly this whole country always has wanted its infrastructure digital or otherwise ‘on the cheap’, if they can find someone else to ‘wear the expense’ they will…thus it is/was with FB, an American platform of a somewhat down market nature ideally aimed at the small business person (nothing wrong with that imo), let Americans do as they do they don’t always get it wrong and money isn’t inherently ‘bad’.

Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.","Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed.","Kogan says he changed the terms and conditions of his personality-test app on Facebook from academic to commercial part way through the project, according to an email to Cambridge University colleagues obtained and cited by CNN.","Kogan says Facebook made no objection, but Facebook says it was not informed of the change, CNN reported. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.","GRAVE VIOLATION","\"If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook's policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,\" Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","On Tuesday people were seen carrying multiple plastic storage containers into and out of the building that houses Cambridge Analytica's London office, among other companies.

The latest allegations — that a Trump campaign consulting firm with Russian connections used improperly obtained Facebook data on tens of millions of Americans to target voters — raise disturbing questions about the roles of both Facebook and Russia.","Will this finally be what it takes for these CEOs to appear before Congress?","Facebook denies knowingly aiding and abetting this or any other misconduct, as do the other companies. They may indeed have been unwitting vehicles for the Russian intervention activities that occurred in 2016. Or we may learn that they were negligent or reckless for financial or other reasons. Whatever the explanations, the tech companies cannot use them any more.","Our top intelligence leaders tell us foreign manipulation is ongoing. They expect Russian intervention to continue in the 2018 mid-terms and beyond. Facebook, Twitter and Google have so far not been willing to take the dramatic steps that only they can carry out to ensure that history will not repeat itself.","Congress must require testimony under oath from Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, CEO Larry Page of Alphabet (Google's parent company), and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. They need to tell the American public what they are doing to prevent bad actors or foreign adversaries from invading their platforms and our future elections.","We need information that only the three major tech companies can provide to fight these insidious attacks on our national security and on our constitutional system. We need to know, for starters, whether any of these companies or their employees knew or suspected what Russia was doing in the 2016 presidential election, and, if so, what they did with this information.","We need to see all the data these companies have related to Russian use of their platforms to intervene in our elections. This does not mean their proprietary algorithms, but it does, for example, mean all of the Facebook posts, ads, groups and events generated by Russia-affiliated groups. The information should be provided for each of the 126 million Facebook users and the 20+ million Instagram users who were subjected to Russian manipulation efforts. Facebook should also notify the 50 million Americans whose profiles were reportedly \"harvested\" by Cambridge Analytica — the consulting firm now suspended by Facebook that claims to have provided the \"secret sauce\" that drove Trump's electoral success.","Twitter and Google, including its YouTube subsidiary, should provide the analogous information to Congress. All of the data provided by the three companies should be provided in searchable form.","The companies need to reveal how much advertising Russia-affiliated groups bought before and after the 2016 election in all currencies, not just the obvious one of rubles. They also need to provide full information about any automated and human advertising support services the companies provided to Russia-affiliated groups, facilitating their intrusions upon American society. For example, did the companies provide support to recent disinformation efforts such as #ReleaseTheMemo and efforts to discredit the Parkland high schoolers?","Congress and the public also need to be fully informed about exactly what advertising support services the companies provided to individual candidates in the last election, and how that functioned. For example, did tech company employees embedded in the Trump campaign provide it with any extra advantages that amplified Russian support or might otherwise be considered unfair?","Perhaps most importantly, Congress and the public need to be fully informed about the steps the companies are taking to eliminate election interference on their platforms, including, but not limited to, interference by trolls and bots — and why they expect these steps to work.","Today, any hostile power or other malicious actor can follow the Russians' 2016 \"information warfare\" playbook, and it is likely that others will do so. We must know what Facebook, Twitter and Google are doing to help prevent that.","To date, those companies have been operating as if it is up to them to decide how much to tell us about their role in Russia’s interference in the last elections.","That is dead wrong.","This is a national crisis and these CEOs and their companies are right in the middle of contributing to it.

Facebook’s disingenuous explanations call for more questions and even less trust.","As Facebook’s leader, Zuckerberg resolves to get things straightened out in the future (“it’s my job, right?”)while he delivers a callcenter-style broken record reassurance: “Your privacy is important to us”. Yes, of course, our privacy is important to you; you made billions by surveilling and mining our private lives. One wonders how aware Zuckerberg is of the double entendre.","This wasn’t Zuckerberg’s first apology. Last September, he confessed that he regretted his previous dismissal of the notion that Facebook might have played a role in the outcome of the November 2016 election [as always, edits and emphasis mine]:","“After the election, I made a comment that I thought the idea misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of the election was a crazy idea. Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it,” the founder wrote, offering his first public admission that his initial remarks were off-base. “This is too important an issue to be dismissive.”","With the Guardian’s new exposé, things are different for Facebook: They’re much worse. The company is in a new kind of defensive stance as it tries to explain how the data of as many as 57 million users was aspirated by a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan and handed over to Cambridge Analytica, a political influence peddler.","After a few days of silence, Zuckerberg talked to the New York Times, to CNN, to Wired and Recode to explain what happened and, more important, to tell us what his company intends to do to put things right.","Carefully reading and re-reading Zuckerberg’s words puts me ill at ease. Of course, simply complaining that Facebook’s CEO sounds well-rehearsed won’t do. He’s a pro at managing a major crisis. Persphinctery statements are part of the fare (from the NYT interview):","“Privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people. One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data.”","But we quickly get to the misrepresentations.","“… someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar.”","Here, Zuckerberg glosses over the pivotal fact that researcher Aleksandr Kogan accessed data in a manner that was fully compatible with Facebook’s own rules (see below). It appears that the rule-breaking started after he put his mitts on the data and made a deal with Cambridge Analytica.","Next, we’re treated to the resolute statements. Facebook now realizes what transpired and will make sure it won’t happen in the future:","“So the actions here that we’re going to do involve first, dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to, so that apps and developers can’t do what Kogan did here. The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago, in 2014. But when we examined the systems this week, there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down, too.”","Three rich sentences, here. And a problem with each one…","First, an admission that Facebook’s own rules allowed developers overly-broad access to our personal data. Thanks to Ben Thompson, we have a picture of the bewildering breadth of user data developers had access to:","(Thompson’s Stratechery Newsletter is a valuable source of insights, of useful agreements and disagreements.)","Of course, developers have to request the user’s permission to make use of their data — even for something as seemingly “innocent” as a game or psychological quiz — but this isn’t properly informed consent. Facebook users aren’t legal eagles trained in the parsing of deliberately obscure sentences and networks of references and footnotes.","Second, Mark Zuckerberg claims that it wasn’t until 2014 that the company became aware of Cambridge Analytica’s abuse of Facebook’s Open Graph (introduced in 2010). This, to be polite, strains credulity. Facebook is a surveillance machine, its business is knowing what’s happening on its network, on its social graph. More damning is the evidence that Facebook was warned about app permissions abuses in 2011:","“… in August 2011 [European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max] Schrems filed a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission exactly flagging the app permissions data sinkhole (Ireland being the focal point for the complaint because that’s where Facebook’s European HQ is based).”","Finally, Zuckerberg tells us that upon closer examination Facebook realizes that it still has problematic data leaks that need to be attended to (“So we’re going ahead and doing that” he reassures us).","The message is clear: Zuckerberg thinks we’re idiots. How are we to believe Facebook didn’t know — and derived benefits — from the widespread abuse of user data by its developers. We just became aware of the Cambridge Analytica cockroach…how many more are under the sink? In more lawyerly terms: “What did you know, and when did you know it?”","A company’s culture emanates from the top and it starts early. In 2004, the man who was in the process of creating Facebook allegedly called Harvard people who entrusted him with their emails, text messages, pictures, and addresses “dumb fucks”. Should we charitably assume he was joking, or ponder the revelatory power of such cracks?","I have no idea how much trust Facebook lost in the current scandal, how much will be lost or regained in the combination of revisiting past misdeeds and making new, more intelligible rules. Zuckerberg, who's very well read, certainly knows that everything runs on trust, even dictatorships."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

However, the social network has accused Cambridge Analytica of holding that data, despite assurances to the contrary.","\"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" Facebook said in a blog post. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","Cambridge Analytica now finds itself in the middle of a political firestorm, amid a roiling debate over 'information warfare' that is being used to influence the electoral process. It stands accused of harvesting Facebook user data to profile voters that that were ultimately targeted by the Trump campaign, which spent over $6 million on information obtained by the firm.","Yet on Saturday, Cambridge Analytica issued a statement insisting it \"fully complies\" with Facebook's terms of service, and was working with the site to resolve the issue.","\"Cambridge Analytica's commercial and political divisions use social media platforms for outward marketing, delivering data-led and creative content to targeted audiences. They do not use or hold data from Facebook profiles,\" the firm said, as it sought to distance itself from a company it originally contracted to mine information.","\"In 2014, we contracted a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally-renowned institution to undertake a large scale research project in the United States,\" Cambridge Analytica said.","\"This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the U.K. Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent,\" it added.","\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" Cambridge said.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" it added.","Spencer Platt | Getty Images","People listen as Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a rally on October 22, 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio.","'Wild West' of political advertising online","In a statement, Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner, one of the most prominent voices in the debate about online political advertising, said the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook spat was indicative of a market that's \"essentially the Wild West\" of advertising.","\"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,\" Warner said on Saturday.","\"This is another strong indication of the need for Congress to quickly pass the Honest Ads Act to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements,\" the senator added.","The firm, initially funded by a multimillion investment by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer and helmed by former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, touted tools using data to identify and sway voters. That approach is now under fire on both sides of the Atlantic.","\"All parties involved — including the SCL Group/Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie and [thisisyourdigitallife creator] Aleksandr Kogan— certified to us that they destroyed the data in question,\" said Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel.","\"In light of new reports that the data was not destroyed, we are suspending these three parties from Facebook, pending further information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,\" Grewal added.","Despite Facebook's claims that Cambridge Analytica used the information in the service of Trump's presidential ambitions, the firm dismissed the notion.","\"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" it said. \"Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly.\"","\"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair,\" Wylie told the publication. \"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" he added. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.","Below is Cambridge Analytica's full statement:","Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook's terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.","Cambridge Analytica's Commercial and Political divisions use social media platforms for outward marketing, delivering data-led and creative content to targeted audiences.

Google Groups can feel exceedingly complicated. Facebook cares little about your privacy. And if you’re still using Yahoo Groups ... why? Instead of the Big Three, consider a service like Groups.io, a sensible, free platform that’s incredibly easy to use.","For a bit of background, Groups.io was founded by Mark Fletcher, who has a deep history of working with online collaboration services. He founded ONElist in 1998, which later became eGroups, which was then acquired by Yahoo and transformed into that which we now know as Yahoo Groups, first of its name and protector of the realm.","Advertisement","Fletcher left Yahoo after the acquisition, but he never gave up on groups, as he described in a 2014 blog post announcing the beta launch of Groups.io:","“Yahoo Groups and Google Groups both exude the dank air of benign neglect. Google Groups hasn’t been updated in years, and some of Yahoo’s recent changes have actually made Yahoo Groups worse! And yet, millions of people put up with this uncertainty and neglect, because email groups are still one of the best ways to communicate with groups of people. And I have a plan to make them even better.﻿“","So, what makes Groups.io great?","Groups.io doesn’t cost anything*","For most people, setting up a simple online group on the service—which can contain as many members as you want—isn’t going to cost you a penny. That makes Groups.io just as expensive as Yahoo Groups and Google Groups, and you get one added bonus as well: no advertising. Groups.io doesn’t fill your browser full of crap, nor does it use any of your group’s data to hit you up with personalized advertisements later.","Advertisement","*Groups.io is a freemium product, so you can pay extra for added features like more storage space for your group (beyond the free gigabyte you get), the ability to directly add new members without their approval, RSVP tracking for events, or a fully customized home page for your sprawling group. We don’t mind—everyone’s gotta make a living—since its free features are plenty comprehensive for most people.","For newbies, Groups.io is fairly user-friendly","Screenshot: David Murphy","Advertisement","If you have no idea what you’re doing, managing a new online discussion group can feel a bit overwhelming. Groups.io has plenty of configuration options to go through, but the service does a good job with its onboarding. As soon as you make a new group, you get a helpful little welcome message that tells you a little bit about how groups work and points you to where you can start playing around with your group’s configuration.","More importantly, all of your group’s primary settings are located under one simple submenu: Settings. You aren’t going to have to wade through countless sidebar menus, sections, and subheaders to ensure that everything in your group is tweaked to your liking. Just click on Settings. Adjust some options. Keep scrolling down. Once you hit the bottom of the Settings page, that’s it. You’re done.","A Groups.io group starts off with everything you need","Screenshot: David Murphy","Advertisement","Making a group on an online service is like making a dinner. Sometimes, you get a huge helping of the main course and you have to ask for a side dish or two. Sometimes you’re told the kitchen is closed and meat is all that’s on the menu. With Groups.io, you get a full meal whenever you start a new group.","By that, I mean that your brand-new group will come fully equipped with all the features you’re probably going to need: a built-in chat service (in addition to your group’s standard email-driven messages), hashtags for keeping group messages organized, a built-in calendar for displaying and managing group events, a handy dumping ground for files and photos, and even a built-in Wiki that you can use to provide more information about your group (or topics pertaining to your group’s activities).","Power users get plenty of third-party tie-ins","Screenshot: David Murphy","Advertisement","If you want to have a little fun, Groups.io can team up with a number of other popular services to help you manage your group in even more clever ways. First, the basics: You can set up special “receive-only” email addresses for your group, and Groups.io can automatically append a particular hashtag to messages sent to each email address, for easier organization.","If you have a Facebook page that you’ve been using to keep track of a group or a project, you can set it up so that anything you post to that page is automatically posted to your group as well. The same is true for RSS feeds—any content coming up on a feed can be automatically dumped into your group—as well as Trello, which can ping your group with a post whenever there is new activity on one of your boards. You can even integrate Groups.io with Github and receive a post whenever there’s a new code commit on your project.","And if that’s not enough, Groups.io syncs up with Slack. As long as person is a member of one entity—your Slack or Groups.io—they’ll be members of the other. And if that changes, they’ll be automatically removed at the next (hourly) synchronization.","Advertisement","Migrating from Google or Yahoo is easy","If you’re looking to make the switch from either platform, Groups.io has a fairly quick and automated way to dump your membership from a Google Group or a Yahoo Group and import it into Groups.io. The entire process takes about a day or so at most. For Yahoo Groups, Groups.io will also captures all of your group’s messages—but not attachments—and import them into your new Groups.io group."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

In the distant background is a blurry picture of a man with an open trench coat. His hands are in his pockets.”","I figured this would be an easy fix. I’d call Facebook and they would act mortified — and the page would come down. But that’s not what happened. Facebook said that because there was no explicit nudity or sex on that page, it would be allowed to remain.","What?!","By the time this page was pointed out to me, there had already been 21 people who “liked” it, and hundreds had had pro-pedophilia conversations.","Soon after Facebook showed a very obvious lack of concern, I called up companies that advertised on the site. Eventually the page was taken down.","Facebook’s pages are also being used — sources around the world told me — as a wee-hours-of-the-morning gathering place for pedophiles and others seeking illegal sex.","They share “jokes” and trade pictures. One comment that stayed up on Facebook for a long time was “You know you [sic] skilled when you can fit 10 kids in 1 self storage [room].”","Pages on Facebook distributing images of teen and pre-teen children in suggestive poses have become the targets of the Anonymous collective. Prior to the collective’s involvement the pages were reported to Facebook, but were not taken down.","Activists associated with Anonymous say the pages are an ongoing problem on Facebook, and that the social media network rarely removes one of the pages. The pages carry names like “Sexy Little Girls” or “Sexy Teen’s Legs.” The pages share images of children in underwear or swimsuits and do not distribute nude images of children, skirting the laws against child pornography.","Activists believe the images are usually stolen from the parents’ profiles and then distributed through a network of websites, groups, and pages that exist on Facebook and elsewhere on the web. Anaid Kejor, an activist with Pedo-Hunters, an Anonymous-affiliated group, offered this advice:","I would like people to realize that this is going on all the time, these pages and the people that run them are stealing pictures from your timelines. The cute pic of your 9-year old girl in a bikini, or boy in his briefs could end up on someone's bathroom wall being an object of adoration. Please do not post them at all, even to friends only. They can be stolen; just don't put them on Facebook.","The main target of tonight’s campaign by Anonymous seems to be the “Sexy Little Girls” page. A comment to the page by a Facebook user who employed the iconic Guy Fawkes mask as his profile picture states:","Facebook will not take this page down so we are anonymous and we will take matters into our own hands.","Posts by the page accompanying a photo of a prepubescent child question whether the girl qualifies as sexy or if she is just cute. Comments by frequent visitors to the page include admissions of gaining sexual gratification from the images.","Those that happen to stumble on the page have left comments stating that they are reporting the page to Facebook or the police, and some openly leave death threats for operators of the page.","Kejor explained her feelings on the pages, Facebook’s lack of response, and shared a little bit of her motivation behind participating in the collective’s actions.","I have been doing this for awhile. I win a few, I lose a few. They all make me angry when I see them, knowing that there are hundreds more on Facebook. I concentrate on those of pre-pubescent boys and girls and do my best to get them taken down. I know what these creeps are doing; they download the pics and do their thing.","Does it make me angry that Facebook doesn't take them down? Hell yes. They don't seem to realize that even if they are not naked, a page of these children in sexy poses, swimwear, underwear, is like a catalog to the perverts. I have grandchildren the age of these children that are being marketed to the \"Facebook pedophiles\" so yes I have a stake in this.","A New Jersey judge has ordered a teenager who accused a man of rape to turn over access to her Facebook page.","Mercer County superior court judge Robert Billmeier this week agreed to a request from David Stevens-Parker’s defence attorney, and the judge said he will privately review two weeks of Facebook postings for any comments related to the alleged rape before deciding whether any can be used in court.","The defence attorney, Andrew Ferencevych, said he wants to see if there are any hints that the sex was consensual. Stevens-Parker, 22, was charged with providing the then-16-year-old Princeton girl with alcohol before sexually assaulting her in April 2013.","Content from social media is routinely used in court, but the New Jersey case is different because it involves a judge ordering an alleged victim to turn over information, said Wendy Patrick, a prosecutor and former chairwoman of the California state bar ethics committee.","“It’s used all the time and the reason is because the internet has become a confessional,” Patrick said. “It’s a place where everyone is an open book.”","Patrick noted that authenticating content found on social media is often the most difficult part of trying to use it as evidence.","\"The defense attorney, Andrew Ferencevych, said he wants to see if there are any hints that the sex was consensual.

This applies to both heterosexual and homosexual conduct. As a general matter, this means that a person who is 16 years old can generally consent to have sex with any adult, regardless of age.","Like most other states, New Jersey’s laws allow for consensual sex between minors below the age of consent, if they are close to the same age.","In New Jersey, a person aged 13 or older can generally consent to have sex with anyone who is no more than 4 years older. Nobody under the age of 13 can legally consent to sex, regardless of the age of their partner.","Penalties for Under-Age Sex in New JerseyThe penalties for violating New Jersey’s age of consent are fairly stiff, but in line with the majority of other states. The crime of aggravated sexual assault, which is sex with a person under the age of 13, carries a penalty of 10 to 20 years in prison.","1. Create a strong password.

After he raped her he laughed, Creppel said to the station.","Later that afternoon, Smith sexually assaulted another woman he met through Facebook who he had just met in-person and had lunch with, the prosecutors told WBBM.","Police were able to link Smith to the third case after his DNA matched evidence recovered from her rape kit, Creppel told the station.","Facebook claims it has 400 million users. But are they well-protected from prying eyes, scammers and unwanted marketers?","Not according to Joan Goodchild, senior editor of CSO (Chief Security Officer) Online.","She says your privacy may be at far greater risk of being violated than you know when you log onto Facebook, due to security gaffes or marketing efforts by the company.","Facebook came under fire, when 15 privacy and consumer protection organizations filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, charging that the site, among other things, manipulates privacy settings to make users' personal information available for commercial use. Also, some Facebook users found their private chats accessible to everyone on their contact list - a major security breach that's left a lot of people wondering just how secure the site is.","In two words, asserts Goodchild - not very.","On \"The Early Show on Saturday Morning,\" she spotlighted five dangers she says Facebook users expose themselves to, probably without aware of it:","• Your information is being shared with third parties","• Privacy settings revert to a less safe default mode after each redesign","• Facebook ads may contain malware","• Your real friends unknowingly make you vulnerable","• Scammers are creating fake profiles","Is Facebook a secure platform to communicate with your friends?","Here's the thing; Facebook is one of the most popular sites in the world. … Security holes are being found on a regular basis. … It is not as inherently secure as people think it is when they log on every day.","Certainly, it is hard to compare this to others; we have never had this phenomenon before in the way people are communicating with each other - only e-mail comes close.","The potential for crime is real. Approximately $1.5 billion was lost in 2012 to online credit and debit card fraud in the US. In 2016, a study by Juniper Research estimated that the costs of cybercrime could be as high as 2.1 trillion by 2019. If you're not careful using Facebook, you are looking at the potential for identity theft, or possibly even something like assault if you share information with a dangerous person you think is actually a \"friend.\" One British police agency recently reported the number of crimes they've responded to in the last year involving Facebook climbed 346 percent. These are real threats.","Lately, it seems a week doesn't go by without some new news about a Facebook-related security problem.","A publication called \"TechCrunch\" discovered a security hole that made it possible for users to read their friends' private chats. Facebook has since patched it, but who knows how long that flaw existed? Some speculate it may have been that way for years.","Researchers at VeriSign's iDefense group discovered a hacker was selling Facebook user names and passwords in an underground hacker forum. It was estimated he had about 1.5 million accounts - and was selling them for between $25 and $45.","And the site is constantly under attack from hackers trying to spam these 400 million users, or harvest their data, or run other scams. Certainly, there is a lot of criticism in the security community of Facebook's handling of security. Perhaps the most frustrating thing is that the company rarely responds to inquiries.","Do people really have privacy on Facebook?","No. There are all kinds of ways third parties can access information about you. For instance, you may not realize that, when you are playing the popular games on Facebook, such as Farmville, or take those popular quizzes, every time you do that, you authorize an application to be downloaded to your profile that you may not realize gives information to third parties.","A study last year concluded that 40 percent of all Facebook profiles are fake. They have been set up by bots or impostors. If you have 500 friends, it is likely there is a percentage of people you don't really know and you are sharing a lot of information with them, such as when you are on vacation, your children's pictures, their names. Is this information you really want to put out there to people you don't even know?","'Anti-Facebook' platform Ello attracts thousands","By Zoe Kleinman, BBC","It was initially designed to just be used by about 90 friends of its founder Paul Budnitz.","But the bike shop owner, from the US state of Vermont, opened it to others on 7 August.","It has been dubbed the \"anti-Facebook\" network because of a pledge to carry no adverts or sell user data.","However some experts have cautioned that it might struggle with plans to charge micro-payments for certain \"features\".","The site has a minimalist design and does not appear as user-friendly, at first glance, as more established networks.","It has already survived a reported Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack - a targeted flood of internet traffic - which briefly knocked it offline over the weekend.","\"We're learning as we go but we have a very strong tech crew and back end,\" founder Paul Budnitz told the BBC.","\"It's in beta and it's buggy and it does weird stuff - and it's all being fixed as quickly as we can.\"","Mr Budnitz added that he was \"flattered\" by the \"anti-Facebook\" description, but said that was not the way he saw his service.","\"We don't consider Facebook to be a competitor. We see it as an ad platform and we are a network,\" he explained.","The network will eventually make money by selling access to features, Mr Budnitz added.","\"Like the app store, we're going to sell features for a few dollars,\" he said.","Members can already check out features in development on the page and register their interest.","However, the traditional model of a free-to-use network has historically been the key to success, said James McQuivey, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester.","\"Over all the other social media experiences from Whatsapp to Instagram to Pinterest - the reason they work is because they're free,\" he told the BBC.","\"You don't invite your friend to connect with you if it costs your friend money. Even in the world of digital music - you can pay for services but most people don't.\"","\"The fact is nobody has ever made a significant move away from any internet provider because of advertising or data.\"","1. Go to your profile page and look for the “Activity Log” button near the right side of the screen. Click it.","2. You’ll see a dashboard for every click, search and upload you’ve ever made (yikes). Along the left sidebar, look for the “search” option — you’ll probably have to click the “more” button that is below the section that starts with “photos.”","3. Voila! Every search you’ve made. You can delete one by one or clear all, which is what I did.","4.

In media reports, Chris Wylie described working with former Donald Trump aide Steve Bannon to mine data, after first finessing a massive dataset from Facebook, drawing upon the personal data of 50 million users.","Story continues below advertisement","Facebook shares were being hammered on the news. The stock fell as much as 6.8 per cent Monday in New York, wiping out all of the year’s gains so far. It was the biggest intraday drop since Jan. 12.","Facebook now says the political consultants in question should have never had this data. But though the company first learned of these problems in 2015, it didn’t apologize or disclose matters publicly. Instead, three years ago, it quietly asked the parties to destroy the dataset, and took them at their word that it had been done.","Facebook said on the weekend that it was conducting a “comprehensive internal and external review” to determine whether any third parties still had this data. “We will take whatever steps are required to ensure that the data is destroyed once and for all.” The statement also said that the company should not have taken the word of the parties concerned. “We trusted those statements to be true.”","After recent revelations about social-media meddling by Russian government agents in the U.S. presidential election, the California social-media giant had already been facing questions about whether it can shield its two billion active users from political manipulations and privacy invasions.","The latest revelations add fuel to that fire. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of the judiciary committee publicly demanded that Mr. Zuckerberg appear before her group to explain “what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters.”","In Britain, Conservative lawmaker Damian Collins made similar demands – even though Facebook executives recently testified before his committee exploring so-called “fake news.”","“It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions,” he said.","Story continues below advertisement","Story continues below advertisement","In recent days, Facebook had been pressed by media outlets – including The New York Times and the London Observer – asking about the magnitude of the data seepage and when it knew about it. But Facebook only revealed its account of what happened Friday night, through a public statement explaining it was “lied to” by one of its clients.","The spur for all this was Mr. Wylie, who this weekend came forward as a whistle-blower, describing himself as “the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating Mr. Bannon’s psychological warfare” tool. He spoke of coming up with algorithms that targeted political messages to the hearts, minds and even “inner demons” of American audiences.","But before that happened, he and his colleagues at Cambridge Analytica first had to finesse an enormous Facebook dataset through questionable means.","As a teenager, Mr. Wylie had worked for the Liberal Party of Canada. He also joined the 2008 U.S. campaign to elect Barack Obama. In his early 20s, he moved to Britain to study property law at the London School of Economics.","Starting in 2013, he was a paid political consultant with an entity known as the SCL Group, a British company seeking to spin out a U.S.-focused unit, that would become known as Cambridge Analytica.","At the time, SCL’s chief executive was courting the business of Mr. Bannon, in hopes of making headway into the realm of American politics. The Breitbart founder had not yet joined Mr. Trump’s team, but was serving as a political adviser to the American hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and his daughter, Rebekah, who gave Cambridge Analytica a US$15-million startup investment, according to Mr. Wylie.","Story continues below advertisement","On the technical side, the Canadian data-dredger was forging a partnership with a Cambridge University professor.","There, an academic named Aleksandr Kogan developed a Facebook app where users were paid a small fee to allow it to develop a psychological profile of them. In the fine print of the app’s licensing agreement, users agreed not only to handing over some of their own personal information, but also a degree of personal information from their Facebook “friends” whose privacy settings were low.","Such collateral research techniques were allowed for academia at that time, a Facebook official said. However, the official added that under the terms of the app agreement, the data was not supposed to be allowed to be passed along to third parties or political campaigns. But in this way, a consenting pool of 270,000 app users, and data drawn from millions of their unwitting friends, was parlayed into an enormous trove of information that could be used for political targeting, according to Mr. Wylie. Teams of political consultants used it to help their clients – including Mr. Bannon − zero in on American voters with known views.","Prior to Mr. Wylie’s admissions, a Cambridge Analytica executive told a British parliamentary committee that his company didn’t have or rely on Facebook data to get the company started. The firm released statements this weekend saying that one of its third-party contractors – and not itself – initially obtained the disputed data and that Cambridge destroyed it when it learned there were problems.","“We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data-analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook,” the company said. It added that “protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do.”","These banned people and companies will no longer be allowed to run apps or advertising or enter into contractual agreements with Facebook.","Facebook alleges that Mr. Kogan, the Cambridge professor who developed the app, misled the company and violated Facebook’s terms by handing over the data. “By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie … he violated our platform policies,” it said.","Mr. Kogan did not return an e-mail and a telephone message at his Cambridge office seeking comment.","We have closed comments on this story for legal reasons or for abuse.

Suggesting that the money would come on stream this year, she said: “I would suggest we can’t wait until next Easter [when the next financial year will start].” At the weekend a report in the Sunday Times (paywall) said there was a plan to announce an extra £4bn for the NHS annually in the summer. May was not asked about this figure, and did not suggest how much extra the NHS might get. She was also not asked about reports the government is considering introducing a new hypothecated tax to fund the increase.","May hinted that the government has now realised that setting up new customs arrangements after Brexit could take longer than expected. This is what she said in response to a question from the Conservative Nicky Morgan, who said HM Revenue and Customs told her Treasury committee that a new customs partnership with the EU could take five years to set up.","We are looking at different potential customs arrangements for the future in order to deliver on the commitments that we have made. We are now the point at being able to look in more detail with the European commission at some of those proposals.

They know what you read and where you shop, what kind of work you do and who you count as friends. They also know who your mother voted for in the last election.","The depth and breadth of the Obama campaign’s 2012 digital operation — from data mining to online organizing — reaches so far beyond anything politics has ever seen, experts maintain, that it could impact the outcome of a close presidential election. It makes the president’s much-heralded 2008 social media juggernaut — which raised half billion dollars and revolutionized politics — look like cavemen with stone tablets.","Story Continued Below","Mitt Romney indeed is ramping up his digital effort after a debilitating primary and, for sure, the notion that Democrats have a monopoly on cutting edge technology no longer holds water.","But it’s also not at all clear that Romney can come close to achieving the same level of technological sophistication and reach as his opponent. (The campaign was mercilessly ridiculed last month when it rolled out a new App misspelling America.)","“It’s all about the data this year and Obama has that. When a race is as close as this one promises to be, any small advantage could absolutely make the difference,” says Andrew Rasiej, a technology strategist and publisher of TechPresident. “More and more accurate data means more insight, more money, more message distribution, and more votes.”","Adds Nicco Mele, a Harvard professor and social media guru: “The fabric of our public and political space is shifting. If the Obama campaign can combine its data efforts with the way people now live their lives online, a new kind of political engagement — and political persuasion — is possible.”","Launched two weeks ago, Obama’s newest innovation is the much anticipated “Dashboard,\" a sophisticated and highly interactive platform that gives supporters a blueprint for organizing, and communicating with each other and the campaign.","In addition, by harnessing the growing power of Facebook and other online sources, the campaign is building what some see as an unprecedented data base to develop highly specific profiles of potential voters. This allows the campaign to tailor messages directly to them — depending on factors such as socio-economic level, age and interests.","The data also allows the campaign to micro-target a range of dollar solicitations online depending on the recipient. In 2008, the campaign was the first to maximize online giving — raising hundreds of millions of dollars from small donors.

When collecting their data from Facebook, some of them discovered that Facebook had been logging call and SMS data for years, and expressed their frustration online. We told you last week this wasn’t really a privacy breach. It’s a feature built into Facebook’s apps, and other applications, that’s only available to Android. If your calls and texts are logged by Facebook, that’s because you agreed to do it.","Over the weekend, a large number of reports revealed the whole phone call and text logging issue, prompting Facebook to explain via a blog post that it hasn’t been collecting that data without permission. You allowed Facebook to do that on your Android without caring or realizing what it means. You can block Facebook’s access to such data on Android if you so desire. On iPhone, there’s no such thing as an app allowed to collect call and text history because Apple isn’t Google.","Facebook said it started collecting data back in 2015, first via Messenger and then through Facebook Lite. But, as The Washington Post explains, it all started much earlier than that for other apps.","Google’s 2012 Jelly Bean release brought over this particular feature. Android would notify users that an app wanted to access the contacts. Built into that permission was also the call and text logging feature. If the app’s functionality depended on being able to read your contacts, you had to agree, thereby allowing the app to also read your calls and text history. Denying access would render that app useless.","It took a few years for Google to fix this problem. Android 6.0 Marshmallow launched in 2015 split those permissions, allowing users to only share contacts with the same apps.","However, Google’s main Android problem is what may have prevented some users to actually block apps, like Facebook, from collecting logs. That’s the lack of timely updates. Marshmallow may have fixed the permissions issue, but it took months for affected users to get the update. Many of the Jelly Bean devices in use at the time would never be upgraded. By then, most Android users who did allow apps to siphon off calls and text data may have forgotten to fix it.","So why did Google allowed this feature in the first place? The simplest explanation is that Google is just like Facebook in many ways. It harvests user data and then turns it into money via ads. That’s how it operates, and that’s something Google services users agree to.","One other reason why Google may have allowed developers to access that data back in 2012 was Apple’s App Store supremacy. This abundance of data may have been Google’s way to lure in more developers. Of course, this is just speculation, as Google would not confirm anything. Google wasn’t able to tell The Post how many apps gained access to call and text logs or how many Android users have sent their logs to developers by accepting these app permissions."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

This add-on is an excellent alternative to deleting your Facebook profile since it gives you the ability to control the data that the prying eyes of Facebook can access.

If you either click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to any non-Facebook websites via the URL bar, they will load outside of the container. You will be able to log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container but when clicking any Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. Keep in mind that utilizing these buttons will pass data to Facebook about the website that you shared from. Additionally, any embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not function. This blocks Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.","Also, any websites that permit account creation or log in via your Facebook credentials will not work properly - this is due to the extension being designed to separate Facebook use from the use of other websites, this behavior is expected.","Like it?

But apparently, when you’re trying to win a campaign, prostitutes, bribes and spies work pretty well too.","On Monday, Britain’s Channel 4 News ran an explosive exposé of the embattled company. Going undercover as a potential client, its reporter filmed Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, talking about entrapping his clients’ opponents by sending “very beautiful” Ukranian sex workers to their homes. He spoke of offering bribes to candidates while secretly filming them and putting the footage online, of employing fake IDs and bogus websites. Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, described how the company “put information into the bloodstream of the internet” and then watched it spread.","This story came two days after a joint investigation by The New York Times and The Observer of London reported that Cambridge Analytica harvested private information from over 50 million Facebook users without their permission. That, The Times wrote, “allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.”","After days of revelations, there’s still a lot we don’t know about Cambridge Analytica. But we’ve learned that an operation at the heart of Trump’s campaign was ethically nihilistic and quite possibly criminal in ways that even its harshest critics hadn’t suspected. That’s useful information. In weighing the credibility of various accusations made against the president, it’s good to know the depths to which the people around him are willing to sink.","Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica is an offshoot of the SCL Group, a British company that specialized in disinformation campaigns in the developing world. It’s mostly owned by the Mercer family, billionaire right-wing donors and strong Trump supporters. Before becoming the Trump campaign’s chief executive, Steve Bannon was Cambridge Analytica’s vice president. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., also served as an adviser to the company.","Cambridge Analytica shared office space with Trump’s San Antonio-based digital operation, and took substantial credit for its success. “We are thrilled that our revolutionary approach to data-driven communications played such an integral part in President-elect Donald Trump’s extraordinary win,” Nix said in a Nov. 9, 2016, news release.","It’s long been hard to judge how well psychographic profiling actually works. Many consider Cambridge Analytica overrated. Last year, BuzzFeed News reported that former employees said “that despite its sales pitch and public statements, it never provided any proof that the technique was effective or that the company had the ability to execute it on a large scale.” Those who feared that Cambridge Analytica was conducting information warfare on the American people may have been giving the company’s self-serving propaganda too much credence.","But whether or not Cambridge Analytica’s methodology works, the fact that the Trump campaign had a crew of high-tech dirty tricksters on its payroll is significant. We already know that Cambridge Analytica reached out to Julian Assange about finding and disseminating Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails. We know that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has asked the company to turn over documents related to the Trump campaign. Channel Four News plans to air additional undercover footage about Cambridge Analytica’s role in the Trump campaign on Tuesday.","At a minimum, we’ve learned that the Trump campaign’s vaunted social media program was built on deception. Shortly after the 2016 election, Forbes ran an article crediting Jared Kushner for his father-in-law’s shocking triumph. Thanks to digital tools, it said, the traditional presidential campaign was dead, “and Kushner, more than anyone not named Donald Trump, killed it.”","For those who knew something of Kushner’s pre-election career, this portrait of him as some sort of analytics genius was befuddling. The small, gossipy New York newspaper he’d owned, The New York Observer, didn’t even have a particularly good website. “He wasn’t tech-savvy at all,” Elizabeth Spiers, the paper’s former editor in chief, told me.","Cambridge Analytica’s corruption helps provide the missing piece in this story. If the Trump campaign had a social media advantage, one reason is that it hired a company that mined vast amounts of illicitly obtained data.","There’s a lesson here for our understanding of the Trump presidency. Trump and his lackeys have been waging their own sort of psychological warfare on the American majority that abhors them. On the one hand, they act like idiots. On the other, they won, which makes it seem as if they must possess some sort of occult genius. With each day, however, it’s clearer that the secret of Trump’s success is cheating. He, and those around him, don’t have to be better than their opponents because they’re willing to be so much worse."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Nix told the committee last month that his firm had not received data from a researcher accused of obtaining millions of Facebook users’ personal information.","In Washington, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said on Twitter that Zuckerberg “needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.”","“This is a major breach that must be investigated,” Klobuchar, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said. “It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves.”","Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, echoed Klobuchar’s complaint.","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” he said. “It’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said on Twitter that “Massachusetts residents deserve answers” and announced that her office will investigate.","The officials reacted to reports in The New York Times and The Guardian of London that Cambridge Analytica, which is best known for working on President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, had improperly obtained Facebook user data and retained it after claiming it had deleted the information.","Former Cambridge Analytica employee Chris Wylie said that the company obtained information from 50 million Facebook users, using it to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.","Wylie told Britain’s Channel 4 news that the company was able to amass a huge database very quickly from an app developed by an academic that vacuumed up data from Facebook users who agreed to fill out a survey, as well as their friends and contacts — a process of which most were unaware.","“Imagine I go and ask you: I say, ‘Hey, if I give you a dollar, two dollars, could you fill up this survey for me, just do it on this app’, and you say, ‘Fine,'” he said. “I don’t just capture what your responses are, I capture all of the information about you from Facebook. But also this app then crawls through your social network and captures all of that data also.”","Wylie said that allowed the company to get roughly “50 million plus” Facebook records in several months and he criticized Facebook for facilitating the process.","“Why Facebook didn’t make more inquiries when they started seeing that, you know, tens of millions of records were being pulled this way, I don’t know,” he said.","Lawmaker Collins said he would summon Nix to reappear before the Parliament committee.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament by giving false statements,” Collins said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

There’s no need to get experiment participants to sign pesky consent forms as they’ve already agreed to the site’s data use policy. A team of Facebook data scientists are constantly coming up with new ways to study human behavior through the social network. When the team releases papers about what it's learned from us, we often learn surprising things about Facebook instead -- such as the fact that it can keep track of the status updates we never actually post. Facebook has played around with manipulating people before -- getting 60,000 to rock the vote in 2010 that theoretically wouldn't have otherwise -- but a recent study shows Facebook playing a whole new level of mind gamery with its guinea pigs users. As first noted by The New Scientist and Animal New York, Facebook's data scientists manipulated the News Feeds of 689,003 users, removing either all of the positive posts or all of the negative posts to see how it affected their moods. If there was a week in January 2012 where you were only seeing photos of dead dogs or incredibly cute babies, you may have been part of the study. Now that the experiment is public, people's mood about the study itself would best be described as \"disturbed.\"","The researchers, led by data scientist Adam Kramer, found that emotions were contagious. \"When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred,\" according to the paper published by the Facebook research team in the PNAS. \"These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.\"","The experiment ran for a week -- January 11–18, 2012 -- during which the hundreds of thousands of Facebook users unknowingly participating may have felt either happier or more depressed than usual, as they saw either more of their friends posting '15 Photos That Restore Our Faith In Humanity' articles or despondent status updates about losing jobs, getting screwed over by X airline, and already failing to live up to New Year's resolutions. \"*Probably* nobody was driven to suicide,\" tweeted one professor linking to the study, adding a \"#jokingnotjoking\" hashtag.","The researchers -- who may not have been thinking about the optics of a \"Facebook emotionally manipulates users\" study -- jauntily note that the study undermines people who claim that looking at our friends' good lives on Facebook makes us feel depressed. \"The fact that people were more emotionally positive in response to positive emotion updates from their friends stands in contrast to theories that suggest viewing positive posts by friends on Facebook may somehow affect us negatively,\" they write.","They also note that when they took all of the emotional posts out of a person's News Feed, that person became \"less expressive,\" i.e. wrote fewer status updates. So prepare to have Facebook curate your feed with the most emotional of your friends' posts if they feel you're not posting often enough.","So is it okay for Facebook to play mind games with us for science? It's a cool finding but manipulating unknowing users' emotional states to get there puts Facebook's big toe on that creepy line. Facebook's data use policy -- that I'm sure you've all read -- says Facebookers' information will be used \"for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement,\" making all users potential experiment subjects. And users know that Facebook's mysterious algorithms control what they see in their News Feed. But it may come as a surprise to users to see those two things combined like this. When universities conduct studies on people, they have to run them by an ethics board first to get approval -- ethics boards that were created because scientists were getting too creepy in their experiments, getting subjects to think they were shocking someone to death in order to study obedience and letting men live with syphilis for study purposes. A 2012 profile of the Facebook data team noted, \"Unlike academic social scientists, Facebook’s employees have a short path from an idea to an experiment on hundreds of millions of people.\" (Update 6/30/14): Cornell University released a statement Monday morning saying its ethics board -- which is supposed to approve any research on human subjects -- passed on reviewing the study because the part involving actual humans was done by Facebook not by the Cornell researcher involved in the study. Though the academic researchers did help design the study -- as noted when it was published -- so this seems a bit disingenuous.","In its initial response to the controversy around the study -- a statement sent to me late Saturday night -- Facebook doesn't seem to really get what people are upset about, focusing on privacy and data use rather than the ethics of emotional manipulation and whether Facebook's TOS lives up to the definition of \"informed consent\" usually required for academic studies like this. \"This research was conducted for a single week in 2012 and none of the data used was associated with a specific person's Facebook account,\" says a Facebook spokesperson. \"We do research to improve our services and to make the content people see on Facebook as relevant and engaging as possible. A big part of this is understanding how people respond to different types of content, whether it's positive or negative in tone, news from friends, or information from pages they follow. We carefully consider what research we do and have a strong internal review process. There is no unnecessary collection of people's data in connection with these research initiatives and all data is stored securely.\"","Ideally, Facebook would have a consent process for willing study participants: a box to check somewhere saying you're okay with being subjected to the occasional random psychological experiment that Facebook's data team cooks up in the name of science. As opposed to the commonplace psychological manipulation cooked up by advertisers trying to sell you stuff.","I'm a privacy pragmatist, writing about the intersection of law, technology, social media and our personal information.

Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F.T.C. confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0.4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week.","The F.T.C. said it planned to determine whether the social media giant had violated a consent decree it signed in 2011 to protect users’ privacy.","The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings. Each violation of the agreement, which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third-party apps, carries a penalty of up to $40,000 a day.","The agency’s acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook’s stock down as much as 6.5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered. Facebook said last week that it was anticipating an inquiry by the agency.","The F.T.C. said in a statement on Monday that it “takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.”","Lawmakers have repeatedly called for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear in hearings on Capitol Hill. Last week, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate commerce committees formally invited him to testify.","“I’m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica, and I’m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there,” Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana, said in an interview. “Facebook isn’t just a company. It is so powerful it is like a country.”","Some lawmakers, such as Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, asked the F.T.C. to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users.","“The sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree,” he said in a statement. “There is no excuse for delay.”","Cambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism, too. On Monday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group in Washington, filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law.","In an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users, The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections, despite a warning from its own election lawyer.","The employees worked on polling, message development, and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals.","The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had “strategic” or “operational” roles. But former employees contradicted that account, suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non-Americans can do for American political campaigns.","Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department, which has authority to investigate “knowing and willful” violations of campaign law. The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which has day-to-day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules.","“It defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election-related activities in U.S. elections that they did so anyway,” said Paul S.

The facts and public opinion are on their side, but the recent battle to pass California’s broadband privacy bill, A.B. 375, suggests that they will face a massive misinformation campaign launched by the telecom lobby and, sadly, joined by major tech companies.","The tech industry lent their support to a host of misleading scare tactics.","Big Telco’s opposition was hardly surprising. It was, after all, their lobbying efforts in Washington D.C. that repealed the privacy obligations they had to their customers. But it’s disappointing that after mostly staying out of the debate, Google and Facebook joined in opposing the restoration of broadband privacy for Californians despite the bill doing nothing about their core business models (the bill was explicitly about restoring ISP privacy rules). Through their proxy the Internet Association, which also represents companies like Airbnb, Amazon, Etsy, Expedia, LinkedIn, Netflix, Twitter, Yelp, and Zynga, among others—Google and Facebook locked arms with AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast to oppose this critical legislation. What is worse, they didn’t just oppose the bill, but lent their support to a host of misleading scare tactics.","How do we know? Because we were on the ground in Sacramento in September to witness every last-minute dirty trick to stop A.B. 375 from moving forward. But there is one positive outcome: ISP and Silicon Valley lobbyists have played their hand. When these tactics are deployed at the last minute by an army of lobbyists, false information is extremely hard to counter by citizens and consumer groups who lack special access to legislators. But over time legislators (and their constituents) learn the truth – and we’ll make sure they will remember it when this legislation comes back around in 2018.","People have not forgotten they had privacy rights that were repealed this year. It is in fact one of the most unpopular moves by this Congress and opposed by voters regardless of political party affiliation. Undoubtedly, the companies and their proxies will recycle what worked in California to other states as legislatures move closer to passing their own bills. To inoculate against misinformation, here is a breakdown of the three most pervasive myths we saw at the final hours.","Let's not let our lawmakers get fooled again.","Read the Bill: the Definitions Are Rooted in Longstanding Telecom Law","Lobbyists often calculate that some lawmakers are not going to closely read a bill and that these policymakers will instead rely on the word of “industry experts” without checking their claims.","In California, the opposition lobby used this tactic and began claiming that the definition of “Broadband Internet Access Service” (the technical term for an ISP that sells broadband service) was inadequately defined and could burden all kinds of companies that are not ISPs. Technology giants like Google and Facebook, using the Internet Association as their proxy, echoed the false claim, providing the air of legitimacy that added to the intended confusion.","In reality, there was nothing vague or unclear about this definition in A.B. 375. The language in the California bill was copied almost verbatim from the long-standing definition under Federal Communications Commission rules.","You can see for yourself in this side-by-side comparison.","And the bill’s author, Assemblymember Ed Chau, went one step further to explicitly state which entities would not be covered by the bill:","“Broadband Internet access service provider” does not include a premises operator, including a coffee shop, bookstore, airline, private end-user network, or other business that acquires BIAS from a BIAS provider to enable patrons to access the Internet from its respective establishment.","The language couldn’t be clearer. But repeat a false claim enough times from enough paid lobbyists and legislators start to question themselves.","No, Broadband Privacy Protections Don’t Help Terrorists and Nazis","One of the most offensive aspects of the misinformation campaign was the claim that pretending to restore our privacy rights, which have been on the books for communications providers for years, would help extremism.","The bill would bar ISPs from sharing potentially identifiable information with law enforcement in many circumstances. For example, a threat to conduct a terror attack could not be shared (unless it was to protect the ISP, its users, or other ISPs from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the ISP's service). AND the bill instructs that all such exceptions are to be construed narrowly.","This would mean that ISPs who inadvertently learned of a rightwing extremist or other violent threat to the public at large could not share that information with law enforcement without customer approval. Even IP address of bad actor [sic] could not be shared.","There is absolutely nothing true about this statement. A.B. 375 specifically said that an ISP can disclose information without customer approval for any “fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the service.” More importantly, it also included what is often referred to as a “catchall provision” by allowing ISPs to disclose information “as otherwise required or authorized by law.”","The catchall provision is key, since there are already laws on the books allowing services to provide information to the police in emergency situations. For example, the Stored Communications Act spells out the rules under which ISPs are, and are not, allowed to disclose content to law enforcement. The California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (CalECPA), passed in 2015, allows ISPs to disclose information to law enforcement as long as it doesn’t run afoul of state or federal law and allows law enforcement to obtain this information without a warrant in specific emergency situations. Facebook and Google presumably know this, because they supported CalECPA when it was in the legislature. Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon know it too.","The Great, Fake Pop-up Scare","In materials like this advertisement, the opposition lobby claimed that A.B. 375 would result in a deluge of pop-ups that consumers would have to click through, and that in turn this inundation would create a sort of privacy fatigue. Consumers would stop caring, and cybersecurity would suffer.","We’ve debunked most of this tale in a separate post , but let’s address the issue of pop-ups. The bill did require ISPs get your permission (also known as opt-in consent) before monetizing your information that includes the following:","But it did not mandate that people have to constantly receive pop ups to obtain that consent. In fact, once you said no, they couldn’t keep asking you over and over again without violating this law and likely laws that regulate fraud and deceptive acts by businesses. However, if the ISP changed the terms of your agreement, they would have to ask your permission again.","Think of it like renting an apartment. If your landlord was going to change your lease agreement, you’d want to know and you’d want to make sure you agreed to any amendments. Being notified of these changes isn’t annoying, it is expected. The only thing that would be annoying is if your landlord kept pestering you to agree to changes you don’t want and did not take no for an answer.","The same applies to ISPs: people are a lot more concerned about ISPs trying to sneak through new invasions of privacy than the alerts they get about those changes.","Internet Users Will Need to Mobilize to Regain our Privacy Rights in 2018","It’s easy to see how lawmakers could be duped in the sleepless, high-speed, waning hours of the legislative session, especially when the information comes from sources that have historically been credible.","EFF will continue to support state efforts to respond, including dispelling the myths spread by privacy opponents. And we’ll need your help to make sure our legislatures respond to the demands of a vast majority of the public and side with Internet users—not the companies that seek to exploit them.","Related Updates","The Senate Commerce Committee is getting ready to host a much-anticipated hearing on consumer privacy—and consumer privacy groups don’t get a seat at the table.

Around mid-2015, the Russians began buying digital ads to spread their messages. A year later, they tapped their followers to help organize political rallies across the United States.","The social network, more than any other technology tool, was singled out on Friday by the Justice Department when prosecutors charged 13 Russians and three companies for executing a scheme to subvert the 2016 election and support Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. In a 37-page indictment, officials detailed how the Russians repeatedly turned to Facebook and Instagram, often using stolen identities to pose as Americans, to sow discord among the electorate by creating Facebook groups, distributing divisive ads and posting inflammatory images.","While the indictment does not accuse Facebook of any wrongdoing, it provided the first comprehensive account from the authorities of how critical the company’s platforms had been to the Russian campaign to disrupt the 2016 election. Facebook and Instagram were mentioned 41 times, while other technology that the Russians used was featured far less. Twitter was referred to nine times, YouTube once and the electronic payments company PayPal 11 times.","It is unprecedented for an American technology company to be so central to what the authorities say was a foreign scheme to commit election fraud in the United States. The indictment further batters Facebook’s image after it has spent months grappling with questions about how it was misused and why it did not act earlier to prevent that activity.","Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, said the indictment laid bare how effectively Facebook could be turned against the country.","Image","Russians used inflammatory posts and ads on Facebook ahead of the 2016 election.","“Facebook built incredibly effective tools which let Russia profile citizens here in the U.S. and figure out how to manipulate us,” Mr. Albright said. “Facebook, essentially, gave them everything they needed.” He added that many of the tools that the Russians used, including those that allow ads to be targeted and that show how widespread an ad becomes, still pervade Facebook.","Facebook, with more than two billion members on the social network alone, has long struggled with what its sites show and the kind of illicit activity it may enable, from selling unlicensed guns to broadcasting live killings. The company’s business depends on people being highly engaged with what is posted on its sites, which in turn helps make it a marquee destination for advertisers.","When suggestions first arose after the 2016 election that Facebook may have influenced the outcome, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, dismissed the concerns. But by last September, Facebook had disclosed that the Internet Research Agency had bought divisive ads on hot-button issues through the company. It later said 150 million Americans had seen the Russian propaganda on the social network and Instagram.","The resulting firestorm has damaged Facebook’s reputation. Company officials, along with executives from Google and YouTube, were grilled by lawmakers last fall. Facebook has since hired thousands of people to help monitor content and has worked with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russian election interference. It has also changed its advertising policy so that any ad that mentions a candidate’s name goes through a more stringent vetting process. Mr. Zuckerberg has vowed to not let Facebook be abused by bad actors.","Yet Facebook’s multiple mentions in Friday’s indictment renew questions of why the world’s biggest social media company didn’t catch the Russian activity earlier or do more to stop it. How effective the company’s new efforts to reduce foreign manipulation have been is also unclear.","Rob Goldman, Facebook’s vice president of advertising, waded into the discussion on Friday with a series of tweets that argued that Russia’s goal was to sow chaos among the electorate rather than to force a certain outcome in the election. On Saturday, President Trump cited those tweets as evidence that Russia’s disinformation campaign was not aimed at handing him a victory.","In Silicon Valley, where Facebook has its headquarters, some critics pilloried the company after the indictment became public.","“Mueller’s indictment underscores the central role of Facebook and other platforms in the Russian interference in 2016,” said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who had invested early in Facebook. “In its heyday, television brought the country together, giving viewers a shared set of facts and experiences. Facebook does just the opposite, enabling every user to have a unique set of facts, driving the country apart for profit.”","Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president of global policy, said in a statement that the company was grateful the government was taking action “against those who abused our service and exploited the openness of our democratic process.”","He added that Facebook was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ahead of this year’s midterm elections to ensure that a similar manipulation campaign would not take place. “We know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,” he said.","Facebook has previously questioned whether law enforcement should be more involved in helping to stop the threat from nation state actors. Facebook said it worked closely with the special counsel’s investigation.","YouTube did not respond to a request for comment, while Twitter declined to comment. PayPal said in a statement that it has worked closely with law enforcement and “is intensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services.”","According to the indictment, the Internet Research Agency, created in 2014 in St. Petersburg and employing about 80 people, was given the job of interfering with elections and political processes.","The group began using American social media to achieve those aims in 2014, when it started making Facebook pages dedicated to social issues like race and religion. Over the next two years, the indictment said, the Russians stole the identities of real Americans to create fake personas and fake accounts on social media. The group then used those to populate and promote Facebook pages like United Muslims of America, Blacktivist and Secured Borders.","By 2016, the indictment said, the size of some of these Russian-controlled Facebook groups had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of followers.","Facebook was also used by the Russians to organize political rallies in the United States.","The Russians then used these groups to push various messages, including telling Americans not to vote in the 2016 election for either Mr. Trump or his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In October 2016, according to the indictment, one Russian-controlled Instagram account called Woke Blacks posted a message saying: “Hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we’d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.”","Around 2015, according to the indictment, the Russians also started purchasing ads on Facebook and other social media sites like Twitter, targeting specific communities within the United States. The group used stolen PayPal accounts to pay for the ads and to promote posts, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the outreach.","In one ad, published to promote a Facebook event called “Down with Hillary,” an image of Mrs. Clinton was shown with a black “X” painted across her face. The text read, “Hillary Clinton is the co-author of Obama’s anti-police and anti-Constitutional propaganda.”","By mid-2016, according to the indictment, the Russians were using their fake Facebook personas to organize political rallies in the United States. That June, for example, posing as the United Muslims of America on Facebook, they promoted a rally called “Support Hillary. Save American Muslims.” For an August 2016 event organized through Facebook, the Russians also paid for a cage to be built that was large enough to hold an actress depicting Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform.","At every step, the Russians used Facebook’s own tools to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible. Those tools allowed them to get real-time results on which types of ad campaigns were reaching their target audience or which posts were getting the most engagement with viewers.","Researchers said that those tools are still widely available and that while the company has worked to remove fake accounts and stem the flow of disinformation, it has refused to let outside researchers examine the data on how Russian actors used the platform so effectively.","“They’re taking steps to fix this, but there’s no easy solution,” Anton Vuljaj, a Republican media strategist who has advised campaigns and media groups, said of Facebook and other social media companies. “This also shows that the public needs to be more vigilant about what is real and what is not online.”","Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from Washington."],"isopubdate":"2018-07-16"}

Buchta’s lawyer requested probation.","Before he was sentenced, Buchta read a brief statement to the court apologizing to his victims and laying out the steps he’s taken to be a “better man,” including earning a high school degree, holding a job and addressing long-standing issues of anxiety and depression.","“I feel like I’m a productive member of society,” said Buchta, reading from prepared remarks. “I have a lot to offer the world.”","Minutes later, when Shah announced that his sentence would include prison time, Buchta burst into tears as his lawyer, Jay Leiderman, rubbed his back and consoled him.","Buchta, who has been allowed to live with his mother, Patricia, in Fallston, Md., while the case was pending, was ordered to surrender by May 22.

But a more serious case of apparent misconduct involves Facebook data going to a different presidential campaign – this time in 2012. In this case, which is getting far less attention, Facebook reportedly voluntarily provided data on millions of its users to the re-election campaign of President Obama. If true, such action by Facebook may constitute a major violation of federal campaign finance law as an illegal corporate campaign contribution. The matter should be investigated by the Federal Election Commission – an agency I am quite familiar with, because I served as one of its commissioners from 2006 to 2007. The commission enforces campaign finance laws for congressional and presidential elections. This is really what the mainstream media, American Left, and Washington Establishment is covering up with the ongoing Facebook probe/Cambridge Antalytica scandal because Obama was actually gifted the 2012 Election through Facebook. Basically what Facebook did for Obama in 2012 was personally hand over data of millions of Americans who use Facebook during the 2012 Election to make sure Obama was really the only candidate Facebook users in America saw in their feeds. ​ Because of this fact that Facebook gave every American's data to the 2012 Obama campaign/Obama administration, then this 2012 move by Facebook to hand over every American to Obama during the 2012 Election simply means that Facebook violated FEC campaign law/Campaign Finance Law by simply selling user data to the Obama team for the 2012 election. Cambridge Antalytica is really a non story, because Facebook actually allowed Obama to have the data of every American Facebook user for the 2012 Election cycle."],"isopubdate":""}

Some of those who did venture a click had their computers taken over by a series of highly objectionable images while malware simultaneously attempted to install itself onto their computers.","The claim that Facebook would be initiating user charges was but the bait to lure people to the protest page and its hidden malicious payload; there are no plans afoot to require payment from those who use the site. Regarding the issue of whether Facebook would ever charge users for its social networking services, that company’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said in an April 2009 Business Week interview that: “The answer is no, we are not planning on charging a basic fee for our basic services. Once again, that question stems from people thinking we’re growing so quickly, we’re running out of money. We’re growing really quickly, but we can finance that growth. We’re not going to charge for our basic services.”","In their Help Center section, the social network says in answer to the query “Will Facebook ever charge for service?” quite plainly “No. We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone.”","In early July 2011, the spread of yet another “Facebook is about to start charging its users” canard (driven by a fictional Weekly World Newsarticle) was fueled by the promise contained in that version of the hoax that users who posted the rumor as their status would be spared the levy. Those who attempted to exempt themselves from the charge thereby spread the lie even further, thus doing the leg work of the hoaxsters. (The logical disconnect of the practical joke seemed to evade many: If Facebook were bent upon extracting fees from its users, why would it choose to exempt any of them?)","In late September 2011, the “post as your status to get out of being charged and make the icon turn blue” hoax ran rampant yet again, this time accompanied by claims that Facebook would be implementing a tiered membership system. The same hoax reappeared in May 2012 and again in July 2013.","In September 2014 the fake news site National Report piled on to this tired hoax meme by publishing a fictitious article positing that Facebook would begin charging users $2.99 per month starting 1 November 2014:","At a press conference this morning, Facebook rolled out their new monthly service plan which begins November 1st of this year. The social media giant says they will start charging members $2.99/mo to use the services that the site has to offer.","“After thinking long and hard about this decision, at the end of the day, we were forced to add this monthly fee,” Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters. “If we don’t do something about our rising costs now, Facebook could cease to exist in the near future.”","As of September 2017 the hoax remained in broad circulation via Facebook. A version attributed to “Mark, the Director of Facebook” suggested that it “seems that all the warnings are real” and “Facebook use will cost money”:","I’m Mark, the Director of Facebook. Hello everyone, it seems that all the warnings are real. Facebook use will cost money. If you send this string to 18 different from your list, your icon will be blue and it will be free for you.

Chair of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Damian Collins has now called for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to provide answers following the investigation.","The founder is to give evidence against the data breach case.","“Data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns,” Mr Collins said on the House of Commons webpage. “I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry.”","Cambridge Analytica had used personal information from Facebook users to create a system that allowed US voters to target them with political ad information. The firm has since been suspended by the social media giant, after it emerged data had not been destroyed following its initial use for Donald Trumps’ 2016 campaign.","The data had originally been authorised to be used by Global Science research (GSR), for a personality-testing application. Hundreds of thousands of users of the site gave permission for their data to be used for the academic purpose, but the company breached the conditions by pulling data from user’s friends’ accounts as well. To further the problem, the data had then been shared third party to Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook wrote in a blog post that GSR violated its data sharing conditions, after sharing data with a third party organisation in addition to failing to delete the information that they stated had been done.","The ICO has said it will launch a formal investigation in the potential breach on the terms of use of the data, which saw the data used for purposes other than those agreed.

At the time I was working on the Guardian’s investigations desk, and I heard the company’s “election management” consultancy was branching out into US voter targeting with a curious new product and corporate identity. This, I would later discover, was Cambridge Analytica.","After that tip came a small cache of documents. And in December 2014, I wrote to SCL asking about its commercial relationship with a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan, and its apparent acquisition of a vast database of personal information harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users by Kogan’s company, Global Science Research (GSR). At this stage I didn’t know whose political campaign it was working on in the US. It seemed to have acquired the data, but how was it using it? I now regret putting the story on the back burner, but when SCL repeatedly refused to engage, that’s what happened. Back then, few had heard of this company.","Fast forward to autumn 2015 and a source pointed me in the direction of a Politico article that made a connection between SCL and Cambridge Analytica. By then it was offering psychological methods for targeting voters to the Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz. So I returned to my investigation and in December 2015 reported that SCL had paid GSR to harvest Facebook users’ data via online questionnaires. GSR boasted it owned “a massive data pool of 40+ million individuals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles.”","Last week, Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, was forced to acknowledge the privacy breach and apologise for the company’s mistakes, embarking on an uncharacteristic media blitz. Yet when I first asked Facebook about the way this data had been siphoned from the social network, the company had little to say. Apparently, it didn’t anticipate the significance the dataset would take on. But then nor did I.","Before we published that story in 2015, I had approached Facebook’s public relations representatives in London to inform them of the allegations. I asked them a series of questions, including: “Is Facebook concerned that highly personal data about a large set of its users is now being exploited for experimental political campaigning purposes?” They didn’t answer. After declining to comment on the record, they emailed a few lines on background: “Facebook has a clear data use policy that makes it clear how the information people choose to add to Facebook is used.” Their repetition of the word “clear” only made this feel more doubtful.","Hours after the story was published, Facebook’s PRs got in touch seeking more information, and later that evening I heard from the mothership itself when a senior, California-based employee emailed a statement. “We are carefully investigating this situation,” it read, “misleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do.” In time, we would come to understand just what Facebook – one of the world’s most powerful companies – meant by “swift action”.","In early 2016, I continued to investigate Cambridge Analytica, pursuing leads about its parent company, SCL, and talking to former employees and clients. I interviewed Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s then CEO and a director of SCL. He refused to say whether he was or wasn’t working in the UK on the leave campaign. (Little did I know SCL had deep ties to the digital firm AggregateIQ, as the Observer reported on Sunday, to which Vote Leave would funnel 40% of its spending.) “We’ve been talking to all sorts of political parties about different matters in the UK,” he told me. In the US, Nix said that “hundreds of thousands of people across America” had taken Cambridge Analytica’s online questionnaires, but claimed respondents’ Facebook accounts were not accessed. He was dismissive of the privacy concerns posed by political campaigns hoovering up voters’ personal data: “If the individuals wish to remain more private then they shouldn’t consent to give up their information.”","As Trump surged in the polls, Sheryl Sandberg told investors the election was 'a big deal in terms of ad spend'","As I read through Nix’s comments in my notes two years later, I am struck by the similarity between his logic and that of Facebook. In rejecting the media’s characterisation of this large-scale privacy violation as a “data breach”, Facebook claims “everyone involved” in the 2014 data-siphoning exercise had given their consent. “People knowingly provided their information,” the company claimed. As with its interpretation of the word “clear”, Facebook seems to have a skewed understanding of what “knowingly” really means.","Facebook’s senior executives may now be feeling apologetic, “outraged” even. But in January 2016, as Trump surged in the polls, Facebook’s COO, Sheryl Sandberg, told investors the 2016 election was “a big deal in terms of ad spend”. In other words, a major commercial opportunity. The ability to target voters, she said, was key: “Using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those,” she boasted. “And we’re seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting.”","It’s perhaps worth remembering, then, that until recently Facebook was encouraging political operatives to take full advantage of its garden of surveillance. And while aspects of the Cambridge Analytica affair may be surprising, and offer a disturbing glimpse into the shadows, the routine exploitation of information about our lives – about who we are – is what’s powering Facebook. It’s the behemoth’s lifeblood."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

It appears he has now made up his mind though, as Facebook sources tell CNN that the company is currently preparing a strategy for Zuckerberg’s testimony.","British lawmakers asked Zuckerberg to appear for a similar line of questioning this week as well, but the social media CEO declined the invitation. It appears that the long-awaited confrontation will take place on American soil.","Much of Facebook’s business revolves around harvesting and selling data to third parties. Whether or not users are aware of the extend of the collection doesn’t particularly matter to Facebook, as long as users agree to the terms and conditions. But every once in a while, Facebook users get a glimpse into the abyss, which is exactly what happened when Cambridge Analytica used the data it gathered to target ads during the US presidential election.","While Facebook will undoubtedly recover from this mess, the fact that Zuckerberg has reportedly committed to going before a congressional committee could put pressure on other tech CEOs to come forward and answer questions.

While you may not have heard of SCL, its political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica has made headlines in the last few years due to work for the Trump campaign and the Brexit initiative. According to former US Magistrate and current Facebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal, this move is occurring because an app “thisisyourdigitallife” pulled in personal information of the 270,000 people who used it as well as information from their friends. While this is allowed under its policy, its creator, a Cambridge psych professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, passed the data onto other parties including Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook’s stance is that it requested the deletion of the data in 2015, which Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and another man Christopher Wylie said they did, however now the social network says it has been informed that not all of the data was deleted.

Facebook can continue to deliver their service to you and send you advertising. The difference is that it will be much harder for Facebook to use your activity collected off Facebook to send you ads and other targeted messages [emphasis added].\"","Mozilla introduced the container concept to mainstream Firefox users in September when it rolled out \"Firefox Multi-Account Containers,\" a company-made add-on. In a way somewhat similar to how Firefox - and other browsers - isolate one tab from others to block app- or system-wide exploits, these containers insulate cookies generated by one site from those produced by other websites. (Normally, all cookies are stored in one memory location by the browser; Mozilla's extension sets up multiple \"cookie jars,\" or storage locations, and thus prevents one site from recognizing and reading cookies recorded by other URLs.)","\"If used carefully, Containers can prevent tracking. If a site is only opened in one Container, cookies set on that container cannot follow the user to other sites visited in non-container tabs or other containers,\" Mozilla stated in a backgrounder about the technology.","Facebook Container is, at root, a customized version of the earlier add-on, as Mozilla explained in another, albeit unsigned, blog post Tuesday.","\"When you install this extension, it will delete your Facebook cookies and log you out of Facebook,\" the company noted. \"The next time you visit Facebook it will open in a new blue-colored browser tab (aka 'container tab'). In that tab you can login to Facebook and use it like you normally would. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\"","Mozilla","Facebook Container signals it's active by shading the name of the service, as well as drawing a thin blue line under the tab.","Facebook has been under renewed scrutiny because of allegations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, illegally collected and retained the data of more than 50 million Facebook users. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an investigation into Facebook's practices, and Zuckerberg will answer questions from at least one congressional committee, according to the New York Times","But while Mozilla capitalized on the turn against Facebook among some users - evidence highlighted by the #deletefacebook campaign - it admitted that the Container add-on would not have helped in the latest instance. \"The type of data in the recent Cambridge Analytica incident would not have been prevented by Facebook Container,\" acknowledged Mozilla's Nguyen. \"But troves of data are being collected on your behavior on the Internet, and so giving users a choice to limit what they share in a way that is under their control is important.\"","Elsewhere, Mozilla pointed out the downsides of adding Facebook Container to Firefox. Among the issues with Facebook: Users may not be able to log in to other sites or accounts with their Facebook credentials, and \"Like\" buttons offered by non-Facebook websites will not work.","The Facebook Container can be downloaded and installed into Firefox from this page of the Firefox Add-ons market.","Mozilla has long touted its browser as the best choice for the privacy minded, with the pitch's credibility dependent, at least in part, on the fact that unlike Google (and its Chrome), Mozilla's business model does not directly rely on monetizing user data via targeted ads. (Mozilla certainly indirectly leans on just that; the bulk of its revenue comes from setting Google as Firefox's default search engine.) The open-source developer repeated the privacy talking points as it rolled out Facebook Container.","\"This add-on offers a solution that doesn't tell users to simply stop using a service that they get value from,\" Nguyen said. \"Instead, it gives users tools that help them protect themselves from the unexpected side effects of their usage.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Because I know that they could have prevented it.’\nPhotograph: Robert Gumpert","Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.","Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.","Where's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds","Read more","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.","Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

It also denied that the Facebook data was used by the Trump campaign and says it didn’t work on the Brexit referendum.","The company insisted Wylie was a contractor, not a founder.","For Facebook, the controversy appears to be taking a toll. On Monday, Facebook shares fell US$12.53 or 6.77 per cent to US$172.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.","Facebook has denied the data collection was a breach because people knowingly provided their information. The company has said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his test via his Facebook app.","Facebook has also said it would ban Cambridge Analytica, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded Kogan’s app. Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn’t disclosed it until now.","On Monday, Facebook said it hired a digital forensics firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine if the Facebook data the company collected still exists or if it’s been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica agreed to give the auditor complete access to its servers and systems, Facebook said.","The social-media giant said it’s also asked Wylie and Kogan to submit to an audit as well. It said Kogan has given his verbal agreement to do so and Wylie has declined.","The Facebook data breach exposed by Wylie in recent days has caused a commotion on both sides of the Atlantic and has caught the attention of Canada’s privacy watchdog.","“Recent media reports regarding the use of personal information posted on Facebook for political purposes raise serious privacy concerns,” Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien said in the statement.","“Our office will be reaching out to Facebook to seek information regarding whether Canadians’ personal information was affected by the issues raised in those reports. That will help us determine possible next steps.”","Therrien also said his office has offered to assist an investigation into the matter already launched by the U.K. information commissioner’s office. He said his ultimate goal is to ensure that the privacy rights of Canadian Facebook users are protected.","Asked Monday about the possible Facebook breach, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the government will take every step to protect the integrity of the Canadian democratic system.","“When an issue like that emerges, we all need to take it very, very seriously, make sure we get the facts and respond accordingly,” Goodale said in Ottawa.","“This is a rapidly moving, rapidly evolving situation because of technology. What we know or think we know today is likely to be radically different six months from now. And we have to be alert to every twist and turn along the way.”","On Monday, Wylie told NBC’s Today in an interview that Cambridge Analytica used data to create profiling algorithms that enabled the company to “explore mental vulnerabilities of people.” It enabled the firm to inject information into different forms of online content, so that people saw things that may not have been true, he said.","“This is a company that really took fake news to the next level,” Wylie said.","He also said he had left Cambridge Analytica before it joined the Trump campaign.

He had been a strong advocate for an aggressive approach to alleged Russian activity on the platform aimed at manipulating elections. His departure was first reported by the New York Times. Facebook declined immediate comment.","In a tweet, Stamos did not deny he was leaving but said: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook.

This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.","The plan centers on third-party brokers like Acxiom Corp. and Epsilon Data Management LLC, both of which collect information to package and sell — sometimes to other brokers, other times to marketers who intend to use the insights on platforms like Facebook’s.","Data brokers have been around a while, each collecting information that dates back before the internet was commonly used in most US households. Back then they collected information on your magazine and newspaper subscriptions, whether you owned a home, and how you were likely to vote. Today they know your sexual preferences, what you watch on TV, who your closest friends and family members are, and even whether you prefer a coupe or a sedan. It’s fair to say the internet has upped the ante.","Major players often purchased this bundled data, using that to help segment specific audiences to advertise to on social networks — in this case Facebook. Mudd is correct in saying that it’s common industry practice. Facebook though, provides targeting options that allow marketers to create laser-focused campaigns using the insights, a powerful combination that hadn’t existed just a decade prior — or, even on the same scale five years ago.","Today’s move to shut the door on these companies is a big one for Facebook, a company burdened by the weight of yet another privacy scandal.

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.","Related Coverage","The recovery in Facebook’s stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company’s relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.","The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.","If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.","ALL APOLOGIES","Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company’s privacy practices.","The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.","The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.","“Facebook’s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,” said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.","Slideshow (3 Images)","In Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is “absolutely certain” that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.","Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers’ access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.","“The was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time,” Zuckerberg said in the ads. “We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”","‘FUTURE REGULATION’","His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany’s justice minister said Facebook’s promises were not enough.","“In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,” Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.","Advertisers and users are also unhappy.","U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet’s YouTube for one week.","Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.","Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.","Reporting by David Shepardson; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Susan Thomas"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}
{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2plx5t2?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.e42c5abb5082","title":"Trump campaign consultant took data about millions of users without their knowledge - The Washington Post","text":["Facebook’s recent suspension of Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that played a key role in President Trump’s 2016 campaign, highlights the rapid rise of a company that claimed it had reached new heights in marrying the art of political persuasion with the science of big data.","Four years after the company began offering Republican political candidates the promise of groundbreaking tools for delivering political messages tailored to the psychological traits of voters, serious questions remain about its tactics and effectiveness.","What is clear is that the services Cambridge Analytica offered are increasingly coveted by modern political campaigns. Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates.","A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work — including a former Cambridge Analytica employee — said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions.","The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates.","Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what “like” buttons they had hit.","“In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,” the statement said.","Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning.","Despite Facebook’s concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump’s digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user- ­experience researcher, according to Facebook’s public website.","Some critics said Facebook’s actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump’s campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","Cambridge Analytica — which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president’s former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon — has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its “psychometric profiles” could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","The company’s actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections.","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain’s information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data “may have been illegally acquired and used.”","The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. “It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,” Denham said in a statement.","Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 E.U. referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee that is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.E.U., a pro-Brexit group.","Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook’s processes for dealing with developers who broke the company’s rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules — usually because of a story in the news — the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said.","Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers.","Facebook “relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,” Parakilas said. “During my 16 months at the company, I don’t recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.”","Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.","“Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,” said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook’s actions on Saturday, including if it ran afoul of its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of its agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","In a statement, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry into U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge’s “psychographic targeting” techniques — including its use of Facebook data — with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of Cambridge’s work.","The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers’ likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time.","Cambridge’s work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm’s data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped.","Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign’s data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump’s strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.","SCL, Cambridge’s parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in “soft power,” or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air.","Among its clients: NATO’s Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russia’s influence in the region.","SCL’s main offering, first developed by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audience’s values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of “persuadables,” and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting.","In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCL’s defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the company’s techniques is that it “can be undertaken covertly.”","“Audience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and government’s role and/or third parties can be invisible,” he wrote.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Cambridge Analytica acquired the personal details of 30 million to 50 million Facebook users to create deep psychological profiles to influence voters during the Trump campaign. The data included demographic information like age and gender, but also users’ political views, jobs, IQs, their levels of neuroticism, and whether they might be militaristic or even occult.","advertisement","advertisement","The secret mechanism through which Cambridge Analytica got all that data is downright typical. It was an “app.” Released by Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan, it linked to users’ Facebook accounts and promised to pay them $1 to $2 for answering a survey. In the fine print, it disclosed that it would “download some information about you and your network . . . basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.” Kogan was using a sneaky but ubiquitous form of data collection on the social network, which Facebook still calls apps.","We’re still amidst the fallout of this news. Heads will continue to roll, and fingers will continue to be pointed. Mark Zuckerberg has already offered a mea culpa. Yet we can’t overlook that the culprit here isn’t just one analytics firm working in isolation. It’s that Facebook allows people to sign over so many rights, so thoughtlessly, by design.","Facebook is part of an industry that fetishizes seamlessness and supposed user-friendliness over privacy and transparency. By characterizing these connected services as “apps,” Facebook encourages us to sign our data away with a click in the name of seamless design–and rarely gives us a chance to object. That practice is now playing out in disastrous ways.","[Source Image: yp/iStock (pattern)]","What Is An App, Anyway?","An “app,” in the eyes of your average consumer, is something you literally download onto your phone or computer. It’s a piece of software in your possession. Implied in this mental model is a sort of containment. An app is like a caged tarantula we can take out now and again. But when we put it away, it stays put away, because no one wants to wake up in the middle of the night with a giant arachnid on their face.","When Facebook began allowing apps to connect with its service to expand what users could do on the social network in 2007, this model was destroyed overnight. You were no longer downloading a piece of software that you somehow owned or that you somehow could unplug. You were connecting to a service that lived on servers, an omnipresent entity that was always there and always watching, even after you long stopped tending those Farmville crops or responding to those Words with Friends requests.","These were no longer “apps” by any definition. They were more like data parasites, attached to us via Facebook. In fact, researchers have found that mobile games and educational apps–innocuous sounding as they may be–are actually the two app categories that are mining our personal data the most.","advertisement","[Source Image: yp/iStock (pattern)]","The Limits Of “User-Friendliness”","On one hand, this setup makes for a very convenient user experience. Why should we be tending all these apps on our home screens when we can just connect via the cloud on Facebook? If a majority of our time is spent on platforms like Facebook anyway, why shouldn’t the software live there, too?","The problem is that these “apps” amount to contracts with users who often don’t understand–or even know of–the terms. In fact, users actually unwittingly enlist their own friends to these contracts by proxy. We see these terms only in the briefest of pop-ups on Facebook. You know the pop-ups. They read something like, “Fast Company wants permission to see your friends and your status updates.”","The user is left with no room for negotiation because Facebook doesn’t require apps to negotiate with users who might want to share less. We cannot by default say, “yes to the status updates–no to the friends stuff, that’s just too far.” Every app comes with an ultimatum–that it can see what it wants to see, when it wants to see it, in perpetuity. Do you even play Clash of Clans, brah?","Even traditional apps, downloaded on Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android platforms, operate with a similar take-it-or-leave-it mentality. And Facebook is far from the sole offender when it comes to overzealous apps. Our Android and Apple accounts serve as our digital passports for countless apps and services that prize slick, seamless design over privacy and data security. They can pull data directly from our phones, or use Facebook and Google logins to suck down additional user’ data, too. Apple, with its revenue made from its devices, rather than data, generally has a much better track record on protecting user privacy. But even it has a stake in advertising and personal surveillance techniques. The New York Timesreported last year that Apple-owned Shazam identified songs playing on your television set for an ad profiling company called Alphonso. Alphonso recorded these clips by leveraging the microphone access inside apps that were distributed by both Apple and Google’s own app stores.","Right now, we’re showing the guy behind the counter at the bodega our Facebook driver’s license to buy some beer. And instead of just checking our birthday real quick, he’s jotting down all the personal information to sell us more beer later. Then he’s asking for our phone, too, just to check out the people in our address book. Then he’s placing a tracking device and wiretap on that phone, so he can monitor everything we say about the beer and can spot when we might be drinking it.","This scenario sounds absurd because it absolutely is. But this is also precisely how these digital app-service-things work, because Facebook empowers them to give ultimatums to users about how they scrape data about us. If users were given even a modicum more nuanced information and control over the way our digital passports are being used by these “apps,” Facebook and its peers could mitigate many of the worst offenses. Instead, the app ecosystem remains a design problem of spectacular proportions, awaiting a fix.","advertisement","[Source Image: yp/iStock (pattern)]","A Bug For Users, But A Feature For Platforms","In 2016, Uber updated its app permissions on Android and iOS to track your location not just when you request a ride with the Uber app open, but for five minutes after your ride, too.

Why didn’t Google or Apple put its foot down first on behalf of its users? Given that the platform holders have the most intimate knowledge about us, and the most leverage over app developers, we need them to set up their APIs and permissions to mandate that the user has the option, at the very least, to check boxes to allow all this access, or at least uncheck the most insidious privacy requests all the time.","Maybe unchecking a certain box means that Uber won’t find me by GPS, or it even takes me longer to get a ride. Less convenient? Maybe so. But at least that trade-off would play out on my terms, especially given that I’m making it on a device I’ve paid for, connected through a cellular service I’ve paid for, for a ride I’m about to pay for. None of this is free. Why are billion-dollar corporations adding a privacy tax atop of everything we’ve already bought?","Using our data, Facebook and Google alone have cornered more than half of the internet’s entire $107 billion global ad market. Indeed, most online data trackers are actually owned by just a few companies, including Alphabet, Facebook, and Verizon. Yet even from a shamelessly capitalistic standpoint, it’s a bad business decision for the protector of 2 billion people’s worth of private data to toss the keys to the kingdom to a company called “Global Science Research” on a whim.","To be fair, Facebook is now addressing many of the points listed above. Yesterday the company announced it would automatically turn off data access to apps you haven’t used in three months. It promised to “reduce” the information you pass along to apps during signup. And it committed to banning developers “misusing” personally identifiable information–though it’s worth noting that exactly what constitutes misuse remains unclear. Furthermore, banning is a reactive solution, not a proactive one, and it can still allow any developer to get away with a one-time data grab.","advertisement","To some extent, the companies that issue these digital passports will always have deep data on us because that’s the reality of carrying a phone every day and oversharing our lives on social media. What we need, though, is for them to keep our secrets secret by design, and in the process, stop data harvesting designed to manipulate us and our democracy–in other words, to keep the metaphorical tarantula safe in its cage.","advertisement","advertisement","advertisement","About the author","Mark Wilson is a senior writer at Fast Company.

The company, which worked on President Trump’s campaign, has faced a backlash after reports that it had obtained information on 50 million Facebook users.CreditCreditJack Taylor/Getty Images","WASHINGTON — Federal regulators and state prosecutors are opening investigations into Facebook. Politicians in the United States and Europe are calling for its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify before them. Investors have cut the value of the social networking giant by about $50 billion in the past two days.","They are all focused on the same thing: whether Facebook mishandled users’ data.","Facebook has built its highly profitable social network off its users, selling advertisements based on their ages, interests and other details. But the scrutiny over the company’s vast trove of personal data — following a report that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained information of 50 million users — is taking direct aim at that lucrative formula.","“Investors are reacting to fears of regulation and the consequences of regulation,” said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. “The scale of errors can only lead one to conclude these are systemic problems.”","So far, most of the social network’s top executives have been silent. Mr. Zuckerberg, its founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, his top deputy, have not made any public statements in recent days. The pair did not appear at an employee meeting on Tuesday in Menlo Park, Calif., where the company is based.","At the meeting, employees asked questions about the continuing internal investigation into the use of Facebook data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The firm, which was tied to President Trump’s 2016 campaign, used the data to target messages to voters.","The meeting, which included Facebook’s deputy counsel, Paul Grewal, largely focused on the steps that Facebook was taking to ensure its data could no longer be misused by independent researchers, according to Facebook employees in attendance. Mr. Zuckerberg was expected to address employees on Friday, when the company holds an all-hands meeting.","Image","Maureen Ohlhausen, the acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission. The agency reached a settlement with Facebook in 2011 on data privacy.CreditSusan Walsh/Associated Press","The company has faced internal dissent over its broader role in spreading disinformation during the presidential campaign and its response to it. The tensions have prompted the planned departure of Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, who plans to leave in August.","The pressure on Facebook has been building for years.","It started in the European Union, where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region’s 500 million people. The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.","After the 2016 presidential campaign, lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics, citing the company’s role in Russia’s disinformation efforts. The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news, and the company’s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future.","The Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers. The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users.","The social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.","The F.T.C. investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third-party apps on the social media site, like games, would not be allowed to access their data. But the apps, the agency found, were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user.","The current investigation has parallels. The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher, Aleksandr Kogan. Mr. Kogan, a professor at Cambridge University, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends. Facebook allowed that sort of data collection at the time.","Image","Eric T. Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, said he was joining his Massachusetts counterpart in her investigation into Facebook’s handling of user data. “Consumers have a right to know how their information is used — and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users’ personal information,” he said.CreditSeth Wenig/Associated Press","Then, Mr. Kogan gave the information to Cambridge Analytica, a firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House political adviser, and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor. Passing the information to a third party violated Facebook’s policies, the company said last week.","“There are all sorts of obligations under the consent decree that may not have been honored here,” said David Vladeck, a former director of consumer protection at the F.T.C.","The company could face fines of $40,000 a day per violation if the agency finds that Facebook broke the agreement.","“We are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating,” an F.T.C. spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday. “We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.”","Facebook said it expected to receive questions from the F.T.C. related to potential violations of the 2011 consent decree. “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information,” Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, Rob Sherman, said in a statement. “We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the F.T.C. may have.”","The F.T.C. inquiry is just one piece of the regulatory backlash. On Tuesday, the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, announced that he was joining the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, in an investigation into whether Facebook had failed to protect the privacy of users in those states. New Jersey’s attorney general announced a similar investigation.","Mr. Schneiderman and Ms. Healey sent a letter to Facebook on Tuesday that demanded records of the communications between the company and Cambridge Analytica.","“Consumers have a right to know how their information is used — and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users’ personal information,” Mr. Schneiderman said. “Today’s demand letter is the first step in our joint investigation to get to the bottom of what happened.”","There have also been growing calls for the top leadership at Facebook to appear before American and British lawmakers to testify about the company and Cambridge Analytica.","Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, have asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to hold a hearing. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, organized by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mr. Zuckerberg demanding answers to questions about how the data had been collected and if users were able to control the misuse of data by third parties.","“It’s time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other C.E.O.s to testify before Congress,” Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said on Tuesday. “The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election.”","Facebook staff members were scheduled to brief the office of Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee, and the offices of members of other committees, including Commerce, this week.","“The possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third-party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling,” Mr. Thune said in his letter.","On Tuesday morning, a committee within the British Parliament sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg that asked him to appear before the panel to answer questions on the company’s connection to Cambridge Analytica. The president of the European Parliament also requested an appearance by Mr. Zuckerberg.","“The committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent,” wrote Damian Collins, chairman of the British committee. “Your officials’ answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the committee.”","Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting from Washington, and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Facebook’s Lucrative Formula Under Pressure From All Sides.

It’s often one of the first social platform newcomers join when they get a smartphone, because everything about it is easy — posting photos, making them look good with filters, adding some trending hashtags and showing friends some love. It’s also easy to trade away your privacy, but here’s how to take some of it back. Get started by opening the Instagram app on your mobile device.","Make your account private","When you join Instagram, your account is set to public by default so that anyone can see your photos and comments. For a higher level of personal privacy, switch your account to private, which will allow only your approved followers see your photos and posts. Here’s how:","Set up blocks","If your account is public, but you want to stop specific account holders (randos, specific creepers, spammers or brands) from seeing, liking and commenting on your photos, you can block them. Go to their profile, tap the three dots, then tap Block user. Just know that blocked users can still see any comments and likes you make on other public accounts.","Thanks, but no thanks, for the suggestions","After someone follows you on Instagram, they’ll be shown suggested profiles to follow based on who you follow. If you want to opt out of that, tap through to edit your profile. Then deselect Similar Account Suggestions.","According to Instagram, “when you opt out of account suggestions on your profile, you won’t appear as a suggestion on someone else’s profile either.” Apparently some account holders strive to be featured on Instagram’s Suggested User List (more followers! more likes!), but it all sounds very Black Mirror “Nosedive” to me.","Check connected apps","Take a look through Authorized Applications to see what apps are accessing your Instagram account. When you installed and connected them, these apps requested some rights to your account and data. They may have also requested permission to do things with your account, such as making comments, adding followers and liking photos. See something suspicious that’s been gathering dust? Hit the Revoke access button and kick them out of your account. Ideally, you want to see this:","Check connected accounts","Linking accounts does make it easier to cross-post content from Instagram, but in the process of setting up that connection, you’re giving up some privacy. Here’s how to check what accounts are linked to Instagram and cut the cord.","To recap, social media is about connecting with friends, sharing moments, catching up on events and being part of an online community.

It also denied that the Facebook data was used by the Trump campaign and says it didn’t work on the Brexit referendum.","The company insisted Wylie was a contractor, not a founder.","For Facebook, the controversy appears to be taking a toll. On Monday, Facebook shares fell US$12.53 or 6.77 per cent to US$172.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.","Story continues below advertisement","Facebook has denied the data collection was a breach because people knowingly provided their information. The company has said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his test via his Facebook app.","Facebook has also said it would ban Cambridge Analytica, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded Kogan’s app. Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn’t disclosed it until now.","On Monday, Facebook said it hired a digital forensics firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine if the Facebook data the company collected still exists or if it’s been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica agreed to give the auditor complete access to its servers and systems, Facebook said.","The social-media giant said it’s also asked Wylie and Kogan to submit to an audit as well. It said Kogan has given his verbal agreement to do so and Wylie has declined.","The Facebook data breach exposed by Wylie in recent days has caused a commotion on both sides of the Atlantic and has caught the attention of Canada’s privacy watchdog.","“Recent media reports regarding the use of personal information posted on Facebook for political purposes raise serious privacy concerns,” Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien said in the statement.","“Our office will be reaching out to Facebook to seek information regarding whether Canadians’ personal information was affected by the issues raised in those reports. That will help us determine possible next steps.”","Therrien also said his office has offered to assist an investigation into the matter already launched by the U.K. information commissioner’s office. He said his ultimate goal is to ensure that the privacy rights of Canadian Facebook users are protected.","Asked Monday about the possible Facebook breach, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the government will take every step to protect the integrity of the Canadian democratic system.","“When an issue like that emerges, we all need to take it very, very seriously, make sure we get the facts and respond accordingly,” Goodale said in Ottawa.","“This is a rapidly moving, rapidly evolving situation because of technology. What we know or think we know today is likely to be radically different six months from now. And we have to be alert to every twist and turn along the way.”","On Monday, Wylie told NBC’s “Today” in an interview that Cambridge Analytica used data to create profiling algorithms that enabled the company to “explore mental vulnerabilities of people.” It enabled the firm to inject information into different forms of online content, so that people saw things that may not have been true, he said.","“This is a company that really took fake news to the next level,” Wylie said.","He also said he had left Cambridge Analytica before it joined the Trump campaign. But he added he knew the company met with Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in 2015, before Trump had announced his candidacy.","We have closed comments on this story for legal reasons or for abuse.

The president would love to clip CEO Jeff Bezos’ wings. But he doesn’t have a plan to make that happen.","Behind the president's thinking: Trump's wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him — and he agrees — that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.","Trump tells people Amazon has gotten a free ride from taxpayers and cushy treatment from the U.S. Postal Service.","“The whole post office thing, that's very much a perception he has,” another source said. “It's been explained to him in multiple meetings that his perception is inaccurate and that the post office actually makes a ton of money from Amazon.\"","Axios' Ina Fried notes: The post office actually added delivery on Sunday in some cities because Amazon made it worthwhile.","Trump also pays close attention to the Amazon founder's ownership of The Washington Post, which the president views as Bezos’ political weapon.","Trump never talks about Mark Zuckerberg or Facebook: He isn’t tuned in to the debate over how they handle people’s data, and thinks the Russia story is a hoax, sources say.","Axios' Kim Hart points out: Trump has said he doesn’t mind Facebook because it helps him reach his audience. He's an old-school businessman who sees the world in terms of tangible assets: real estate, physical mail delivery, Main Street, grocery stores. It reminds me of the story Jim wrote about Trump’s fixation with 1950s life. Amazon takes direct aim at some of the core components of mid-century business.","One warning sign for Facebook: Vice President Mike Pence is concerned about Facebook and Google, according to a source with direct knowledge.","Though Pence isn't yet pushing internally for any specific regulations, he argues these companies are dangerously powerful.","The source said the V.P. worries about their influence on media coverage, as well as their control of the advertising industry and users’ personal info.","When private discussions have turned to the idea of busting Facebook and Google, Pence has listened with keen interest and is open to the suggestion that these two companies need shaking up.","2.

He was placed into removal proceedings in 2012, while behind bars in Illinois, and had been in ICE custody since Sept. 23, 2016, Ms. Alberico said.","Mr. Perez-Montes’s case rose to prominence after Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois and an Iraq war veteran, appealed to the Department of Homeland Security on Friday to stay his deportation and review his case.","“This is a deplorable way to treat a veteran who risked his life in combat for our nation,” she wrote in a letter to the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen.","Mr. Perez-Montes enlisted in the Army in 2001, before the Sept. 11 terror attacks. As a paratrooper and private first class in Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003, he began suffering from “severe” symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, Senator Duckworth said. He was discharged in 2004.","Seven years later, in 2011, the Department of Veterans Affairs diagnosed him with PTSD related to his service, the senator said. “Without proper V.A. care, he self-medicated with drugs and alcohol to cope with his PTSD, which eventually resulted in his drug conviction,” she added, calling his deportation a “shocking betrayal.”","Asked about Senator Duckworth’s letter, the Department of Homeland Security said Monday that its Citizenship and Immigration Services division had denied Mr. Perez-Montes’s request for naturalization on March 15 because of the felony conviction.","“After his two tours of duty with the special forces, he came back a broken man due to the horrors he witnessed in Afghanistan and the physical brain injury he suffered while there,” said Christopher Bergin, Mr. Perez-Montes’s lawyer.","He said Mr. Perez-Montes’s role was to repair vehicles in Kandahar, and that his brain injury occurred after a grenade went off near his vehicle.","Mr. Perez-Montes’s family was not alerted before he was deported, Mr. Bergin said.","“His family was never able to hand him some money and some clothes before they deported him in his prison clothes,” Mr. Bergin said. “He had nothing else.”","Mr. Perez-Montes lived in Mexico until he was 8, when he came to the United States on a petition through a family member. He was raised in Chicago and has been a permanent legal resident since age 11, according to a statement on Senator Duckworth’s website. He was never in the country illegally, Mr. Bergin said.","Mr. Bergin said that Mr. Perez-Montes, who has two children who are citizens, was afraid that if he returned to Mexico he would become a target of cartels that would try to recruit him because of his military experience, or kill him if he refused. Mr. Bergin said last week that he planned to appeal the denial of citizenship “as far up the court ladder as we must climb.”","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Senator Says Deportation Of Veteran Is a ‘Betrayal’.

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly “legitimate way and through proper channels” when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie.","Kogan’s app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Advertisement - story continues below","It seems that Facebook allowed Kogan’s app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as “likes,” because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators. Kogan was reportedly able to create more than 50 million profiles using the trend and characteristics data before providing them to Cambridge.","“Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” Wylie said of Cambridge, according to The New York Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Do you think this company helped Trump win the election as Facebook claims?","YesNo","Completing this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge.

What is more clear is that Facebook’s features can help sow seeds of further discord by allowing operators to capitalize on polarization.","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology, said in a statement. “While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways.”","Advertisement - story continues below","Severalreports, including The New York Times’ one, are referring to the actions of Cambridge Analytica — which had social media prowess described as the “secret sauce” to Trump’s political campaign — as a data “breach.”","But as noted by Grewal in an update made Saturday morning, “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false” because Kogan requested and gained access through permissible, in fact, standard, means. “Everyone involved gave their consent,” said Grewal.","Facebook says it is subjecting all apps that seek personal user information to its App Review process, “which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.”","Founded by Tucker Carlson, a 25-year veteran of print and broadcast media, and Neil Patel, former chief policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, The Daily Caller News Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit providing original investigative reporting from a team of professional reporters that operates for the public benefit."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information. According to Facebook, that download might also include the “unique number” Facebook assigns to you for facial recognition purposes, based on the photos you’ve been tagged in on the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

Whom did they target, you good people ask? Those psychologically profiled as fearful, aggrieved and and prejudiced. Gee, wonder what group as a whole that describes? Maybe, um…..white people!","Cambridge Analytica CEO was secretly recorded by the British Press selling his product to potential clients, saying for one, “You never want to wage a political campaign on the issues. You want to run it on emotions. As we all know that emotions are the only thing that matter.” I would say that and intelligence plays a significant part also. Hillary voters didn’t fall for fake fucking news stories. They were and are very discerning even when they desperately wanted to believe something. Sorry Faux “News” retards, those are just the facts. Look up the 60 Minutes piece on the Trump fake news factories in Albania. Teen boys in shitty nowhere villages got rich copy/pasting fake news from Infowars and such. They are actually on camera telling Steve Croft that Trump people were the only people that they could make money off because they believe anything. And they never get any clicks (therefore no money) from the Hillary people. Them’s just facts, buttercups. Suck it up.","So, emotions and intelligence. Who was targeted? Hmmm. What group was most vulnerable to a psychological attack from a foreign entity? Hmmm. Who was feeling fearful, aggrieved, angry and inferior? Hmmm. White people!. That’s who. Particularly uneducated, rural, southern white people in the lower quadrant of the income scale. In other words the ones who have lost the most status in recent years and understand it least as the world passes them by. They cling to the past (when just being white guaranteed you a decent living and gave you status above people of color no matter if you deserved it our not.) MLK said it best. America is was not a meritocracy then and still is not. So who was vulnerable? The scared and dumb. Damn, that turned out to be a LOT of white people.","Bannon was successful in changing the culture by inflaming white people’s fear. Or was he really? he’s been doing the same shit for years and always been laughed off as a kook. Made fun of on late night TV when noted at all. Does he deserve any credit for changing such a monumental thing as the culture of a country? Or was he just a MF doing his thing in the corner when the spotlight just happened to find him by accident. Right place at right time. The zeitgeist, if you will. In any case, it was done. The culture is currently one of hate. Racial hatred. (Is there another kind? At its heart, it’s all tribal.) Now, will it change back? Can it be changed back? If nazism was reversed then there’s hope for all but, damn, its going to be hard. In the end though they just don’t have the numbers to maintain the hate war. It’s just math. Thank god America, for the most part, is still a place full of striving ideals and people that hold inclusion and decency as some of the most dear of them. America is becoming California. And you know who runs Cali. Hillary beat Trump’s ass by three million votes just there. This is a last gasp of dying white pride and all the attendant cruelty.","So remember, who fell for this shit? Trump’s rednecks, Bernie’s college educated rednecks and Stein’s commie traitors. By the definitions of the targeters, the weakest, most fearful people. That’s who they were looking for. Who they spent their money culling out of all the tens of millions of Facebook users (I’d argue that just being a Facebook user makes you weak and vulnerable. But that’s just me. Get on Twitter MF’s!) Who didn’t fall for the Russian/midget putin, Bannon and Trump troika okey doke? People of color! That’s who. Any black women fall for this shit? Hell nah. Again, just do what black women do and this whole country will turn out alright."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

(Bloomberg)","1 big thing ... Inside the room: Trump hates Amazon, not Facebook","Marine One approaches the White House carrying President Trump on Sunday, after a weekend in Florida. (Zach Gibson / Getty Images)","Instead, Axios' Jonathan Swan reports, the tech behemoth Trump wants to go after is Amazon, according to five sources who’ve discussed it with him.","“He’s obsessed with Amazon,” a source said. “Obsessed.”","What we're hearing: Trump has talked about changing Amazon’s tax treatment because he’s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.","A source who’s spoken to POTUS: “He’s wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law.\"","Trump’s deep-seated antipathy toward Amazon surfaces when discussing tax policy and antitrust cases. The president would love to clip CEO Jeff Bezos’ wings. But he doesn’t have a plan to make that happen.","Behind the president's thinking: Trump's wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him — and he agrees — that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.","Trump tells people Amazon has gotten a free ride from taxpayers and cushy treatment from the U.S. Postal Service.","“The whole post office thing, that's very much a perception he has,” another source said. “It's been explained to him in multiple meetings that his perception is inaccurate and that the post office actually makes a ton of money from Amazon.\"","Axios' Ina Fried notes: The post office actually added delivery on Sunday in some cities because Amazon made it worthwhile.","Trump also pays close attention to the Amazon founder's ownership of The Washington Post, which the president views as Bezos’ political weapon.","Trump never talks about Mark Zuckerberg or Facebook: He isn’t tuned in to the debate over how they handle people’s data, and thinks the Russia story is a hoax, sources say.","Axios' Kim Hart points out: Trump has said he doesn’t mind Facebook because it helps him reach his audience. He's an old-school businessman who sees the world in terms of tangible assets: real estate, physical mail delivery, Main Street, grocery stores. It reminds me of the story Jim wrote about Trump’s fixation with 1950s life. Amazon takes direct aim at some of the core components of mid-century business.","One warning sign for Facebook: Vice President Mike Pence is concerned about Facebook and Google, according to a source with direct knowledge.","Though Pence isn't yet pushing internally for any specific regulations, he argues these companies are dangerously powerful.","The source said the V.P. worries about their influence on media coverage, as well as their control of the advertising industry and users’ personal info.","When private discussions have turned to the idea of busting Facebook and Google, Pence has listened with keen interest and is open to the suggestion that these two companies need shaking up.","2. Trump’s land of make-believe","President Trump often gets agitated — and stirred to action — by random things he hears on TV or from shoot-the-bull conversations with friends.","It drives staff nuts because they are responding to things that are either inaccurate, highly distorted or flat-out don't exist.","Exhibit 1: The post office example from item above","Exhibit 2: \"Per two senior administration officials, Trump continued to rail privately about the omnibus bill, and has become convinced of things that aren’t true about it,\" the N.Y. Times' Maggie Haberman tweeted yesterday.","3. Who's gonna pay for the wall? Surprise!","\"Ryan offered little ­reaction to the idea ... [S]enior Capitol Hill officials later said it was an unlikely prospect.\"","\"Trump has told advisers that he was spurned in a large spending bill last week when lawmakers appropriated only $1.6 billion for the border wall.\"","\"He has suggested to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ... that the Pentagon could fund the sprawling project, citing a 'national security' risk.\"","Be smart: Trump has to think of something. Some top alumni of his campaign think that the wall was such a centerpiece promise, it's the one issue the base might desert over. So Trump has to come up with some plausible \"wall\" by 2020.","4.

Times reports:","Why it matters: The question could discourage immigrant participation.","\"The Constitution requires that every resident of the United States be counted in a decennial census, whether or not they are citizens.\"","\"The results are used not just to redraw political boundaries from school boards to House seats, but to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and subsidies.\"","The 12 states: \"The New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said he was leading a multistate lawsuit to stop the move, and officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington said they would join the effort. The State of California filed a separate lawsuit.\"","6. Exodus of U.S. tech workers to Canada","Illustration: Rebecca Zisser / Axios","Tech companies in and around Toronto have seen a surge in international job applications over the last year, by far mostly from the U.S., according to a survey by the tech hub MaRS, Axios future editor Steve LeVine writes:","The number doubled and tripled in some of the companies, the result of a deliberate Canadian campaign to attract tech workers from the U.S. and around the world.","Why it matters: The spike in applications and hiring adds to the evidence suggesting that Trump's immigration crackdown is resulting in a loss of tech workers to Canada.","8. Tim Cook takes road show to Chicago school","The audience records the \"reveal\" of the new iPad during an Apple event in Chicago.

Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds | News | The Guardian","text":["The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has remained silent over the more than 48 hours since the Observer revealed the harvesting of 50 million users’ personal data, even as his company is buffeted by mounting calls for investigation and regulation, falling stock prices and a social media campaign to #DeleteFacebook.","Facebook’s shares slid 6.77% on Monday following the news, knocking $36bn off the company’s valuation as investors worried about the consequences of the revelations. Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.","Cambridge Analytica boasts of dirty tricks to swing elections","Read more","The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analyticato determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.","The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.","The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unlikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.","On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.","“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.","The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.","Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.","Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.","Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.","Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change.

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

Jumping on the horrified bandwagon without running your own due diligence simply makes you an uneducated sheep.","So I was curious and downloaded my data to see exactly what this current-state crisis business has been doing with my information, what they have and what they should not have. I've not seen anything that's made me projectile vomit so far but then again, I'd need to click each of the messaging files individually for a thorough investigation. I have hundreds of these, yet from clicking random files so far, nothing drastic has come up that's non Facebook communication. I did see a massive list of my phone contact information - a feature I turned off many years ago. That, in itself is a privacy violation yet I have to play devils here that they captured this before I repeatedly kept turning off the feature, when they repeatedly 'bug defect?' kept turning it back on.","But...I did see that Facebook gave my contact information to 155 random advertisers. What contact information? All my contacts, just my name and email, all my data? Here's the link to the companies that Facebook gladly shared my 'contact' details with. Which may oppose Facebook's terms of privacy.","Not being a lawyer but having great experience in this arena, the word 'sell' is ambiguous in relation to this topic. They state clearly they won't sell my information, but there's no reference about 'giving it away for free.' And the word 'information' is intentionally vague. What information? Then again, Facebook and these 155 advertisers cocked up royally in their next step intentions. They've not targeted me directly, spammed me or caused havoc in my life as a result of having this big data. Every global corporation has admitted they have no idea what to do with big data. It's futile sharing. Then again, I know exactly what to do with big data so I know how to positively make it work.","Facebook has to be free for users to join because it affects their stock value when investors know they have nearly 300m fake user accounts - most likely a great number more. Therefore, their valuation is warped and inaccurate yet investors know this when they're injecting cash. Distortion is part of the game.","If you're going to use a social platform, don't be startled when you download your account and all its bells & whistles of information. Free is never free because users pay a price regardless. To be appalled by what you download means you're naively blind sighted. The moment you signed up to Facebook, you willingly gave them the key to your online & offline life door.","So take it with a pinch of salt. They're screwing up repeatedly at the moment and the can of worms are spilling out at a staggering rate that's truly damaging their brand reputation. But I'd rather have this than join a shyster social platform, that will vanish with my life door key and cash in greatly at my expense. Wouldn't you?"],"isopubdate":""}

It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe.","What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.)","We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front.","For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place:","User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now.","Privacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that.","Downloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.","The news comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week posting an acknowledgement of Facebook’s role in the scandal, and a pledge to improve the company’s practices with regards to third-party apps and how Facebook works with them, and what data it will provide in the future, which he also followed up with a full-page apology printed in several newspapers. It has not been enough for some, and #deletefacebook has become a trending concept, with the company’s stock taking a nosedive in the last two weeks.","About Us","Breaking News Home\nHome Of Information Around The World.","Is an advanced news hub, which covers all sphere of news line.

We're far from the end of the saga.","\"Technologists in general need to grapple with this. We’re building tools that can quite clearly be used for evil or for less good. It’s not enough to say, 'We didn’t mean for them to be used this way,'\" said Daniel Mintz, chief data evangelist at software company Looker. \"We need to have a community discussion of what does ethical technology use look like and people can subscribe to them or not.\"","As former Google engineer Yonatan Zunger wrote for the Boston Globe over the weekend, computer science is undergoing a \"reckoning\" and an \"ethics crisis\" not unlike what has happened in chemistry with dynamite, in physics with nuclear bombs, and in human biology with eugenics. The data scientists Mashable spoke with said they didn't see their jobs in jeopardy but did foresee future changes in the tech industry that are long overdue. But it remains to be seen who will take direct action and whether or not any of these moves are the right decision.","Data = $$$","Bill Gates declared \"Content is King\" in an essay published to Microsoft's website back in 1996. “Content is where I expect much of the real money will be made on the Internet, just as it was in broadcasting,\" Gates wrote in the opening. But ask any internet-focused company in 2018, and the answer you'll hear will most likely be data.","Data has become a business in itself. Founders look to find underserved areas, get as much data as they can, and therefore, become valuable. If Facebook, or another tech giant, doesn't buy a startup to keep it a standalone service or just want to acqui-hire executives, the data itself becoming a part of Facebook's empire can be reason enough. When French entrepreneur Thomas Pasquet thought about his next company in digital advertising after selling his startup, he looked at smartphones.","\"A company that started war on mobile would be the company with the most access to data, the most comprehensive data,\" Pasquet told Mashable.","In 2014, Pasquet started Ogury and has since collected more than 400 million mobile user profiles that helps it analyze how people use apps. For example, Ogury's data suggested that Snapchat's active user base dropped in January, with 82.7 percent of people who had it downloaded using the app at the beginning of the month and only 77 percent doing so on January 31. For an advertising agency, those consumer insights can be valuable. (Snapchat releases daily active user data on a quarterly basis, and the quarter including January has yet to be made public. However, Snapchat says it had 187 million daily active users in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, up from 178 million in the previous quarter.)","For Pasquet and Ogury, collecting more data can mean making more money. For Mintz and Looker, the overwhelming amount of data has created a business. Looker doesn't provide new data sources. Rather, Looker is a tool that visualizes existing data sets.","\"The things that got me excited about it were not the technical side of it but what it has empowered me to do. Data is the only way to make sense of what 7 or 8 million people want to do,\" Mintz said.","Given that idea of scale, Mintz said he doesn't see a future where data-fueled decisions and data-focused companies simply disappear. But change could come in how this information is collected and by what services.","Trust with transparency","While data can help advertisers — or anyone really — better understand the world, the scandal around Facebook and Cambridge Analytica stems from not being transparent about what exactly is happening behind the scenes.","Facebook users may have thought they were just taking a personality test for academic research or playing a fun cow game, but these actions led data scientists — not just the software engineers at Facebook — to have access to unsuspected users' personal information.","\"I think transparency is key to everything here. If you’re accessing someone’s data, I think it works best when they know why and what value you’re getting out of it,\" said Patrick Ambron, CEO at BrandYourself.","Ambron's business is fairly clear on how it makes money. That's in part because it's a subscription service rather than an advertising business like Facebook. BrandYourself sells a tool that scans people's social media accounts and flags certain content as problematic.","\"We’re a good case of it being a clear transaction of why you’re giving us your data, and you’re paying us money,\" Ambron told Mashable.","Ogury also claims it is \"clear\" with user consent. All users are shown an agreement called \"Consent to Collection and Use of Data,\" which says that the data collected \"may include information about your device, location, email, application, and browsing usage.\" Pasquet, Ogury's founder, said that at least one of three people reads the agreement and does not choose to opt into the tracking.","\"At the start we said the consumers are smart, and we should ask them directly if they’re willing to share information,\" Pasquet said.","On the other hand, Facebook users don't necessarily understand exactly how their activities are being monitored and why. It can seem impossible to stop it even if you delete the app. Pasquet mentioned a frustrating example where someone could see a surprise vacation their significant other booked via online ad tracking. Impending UK regulations will create more data protections overseas, but data remains vulnerable in the U.S. and beyond, at least for now","Facebook could be forced or decide on its own to change that by updating its user agreement and surfacing it more often to its users, Ambron said. To prevent another Cambridge Analytica scandal, he also suggested creating stricter contracts with companies that use its data. Facebook should still make anonymized data available for academic researchers, like it's doing with Stanford economics professor Raj Chetty's America inequality study, but they need to do more thorough vetting and continuously audit, Ambron added.","\"We as a society haven’t figured out yet how to keep the societal contract agile enough to keep up with the real rapid pace of change, and I think we have to,\" Mintz said. \"Technological change is not going to slow down, and it can’t just be a free for all.\"","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

The House is expected to mirror the Senate’s action next week, followed by a signature from President Trump.","The move means Verizon, Comcast or AT&T can continue tracking and sharing people’s browsing and app activity without permission, and it alarmed consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers. They warned that broadband providers have the widest look into Americans’ online habits, and that without the rules, the companies would have more power to collect data on people and sell sensitive information.","“These were the strongest online privacy rules to date, and this vote is a huge step backwards in consumer protection writ large,” said Dallas Harris, a policy fellow for the consumer group Public Knowledge. “The rules asked that when things were sensitive, an internet service provider asked permission first before collecting. That’s not a lot to ask.”","The privacy rules were created in October by the Federal Communications Commission, and the brisk action of Congressional Republicans, just two months into Mr. Trump’s administration, foreshadowed a broader rollback of tech and telecom policies that have drawn the ire of conservative lawmakers and companies like AT&T, Verizon and Charter.","Republican lawmakers and the new chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, have said the privacy rules were onerous and unfairly strapped regulations on telecom carriers, but not on web companies such as Facebook and Google that also provide access to online content.","“It is unnecessary, confusing and adds another innovation-stifling regulation,” Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said this month when he introduced the resolution to overturn the rules using the Congressional Review Act procedure that lets Congress overrule new agency regulations.","The Senate’s vote was a victory for giant telecommunications and cable companies. The F.C.C. chairman under the Obama administration, Tom Wheeler, had declared that broadband would be regulated more heavily, by categorizing the service in the same regulatory bucket as telephone services, which are viewed as utilities.","That move acknowledged the importance of the internet for communications, education, work and commerce and the need to protect online users, Mr. Wheeler had said.","Under the internet privacy rules that Mr. Wheeler passed, apart from broadband providers having to ask permission to track browsing and other online activities of a user, the companies were also required to use “reasonable measures” to secure consumer data against hackers. The privacy rules were scheduled to go into effect at the end of this year","Broadband providers had balked and ramped up lobbying against the rules. Comcast and other broadband providers created the lobbying group 21st Century Privacy Coalition, led by a former Federal Trade Commission chairman, Jon Leibowitz, to defeat the broadband privacy rules.","With Republicans now in charge across the government, AT&T and Comcast are also poised to benefit from further deregulation. Since the presidential election, the companies have pushed the new Republican-led F.C.C., lawmakers and the White House to roll back net neutrality, the requirement that broadband providers give equal access to all content on the internet, saying the rules hamper their ability to invest in new networks and jobs.","The F.C.C. chairman, Mr. Pai, has also talked with Republican allies in Congress about privacy and broadband classification. Mr. Pai has already chipped away at more than a dozen regulations, including aspects of net neutrality and the program, known as Lifeline, that provides subsidies for broadband users in low-income households.","Consumer groups warned that internet users would suffer from the changes. The Federal Trade Commission, the consumer protection agency, is barred from overseeing broadband providers, so without the F.C.C. privacy rules, the federal government will be a weaker watchdog over internet privacy, supporters of the regulations said.","“Senate Republicans just made it easier for Americans’ sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared and sold to the highest bidder without their permission,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.","Democrats had taken to the Senate floor on Wednesday and Thursday to warn that without the rules, broadband providers will now have free range to peer into their customers’ lives. A company like AT&T or Sprint can tell the time people wake up by when they check the clock on their phone, or see where users go to lunch or whom they visit. By tracking a user’s browsing of medical websites, a carrier can also determine if that person might have an illness.","The Senate’s action also signaled a philosophical shift on tech regulation. Lawmakers and Mr. Pai have said regulations should be created only when there is proof of harmful activity. They also argue that the telecom industry competes with internet firms such as Facebook and Google for access to online content, so any rules should also include those companies. Republicans have said the F.T.C. should be the watchdog for all online privacy.","But Democratic regulators have said the key difference is that consumers do not have many choices for broadband access, which makes them vulnerable to data collection by internet service providers.","“Subscribers have little or no competitive choice as to which provider to use,” said Terrell McSweeny, a Democratic commissioner of the F.T.C. Yet broadband providers “know our identities, and their position gives them the technical capacity to surveil users in ways that others cannot.”","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Senate Votes to Overturn Web Privacy.

It might be a wake-up call. - The Washington Post","text":["Here’s how to download all your data from Facebook. It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information. According to Facebook, that download might also include the “unique number” Facebook assigns to you for facial recognition purposes, based on the photos you’ve been tagged in on the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

I think he also understands that the way to get there is to give people granular control and comfort. He hopes you'll get more open, and he's kind of happy to help you get there. So for him, it's more of a means to an end. For me, I'm not as sure.\"","Zuckerberg reportedly hacked into people's email using their TheFacebook passwords...","At one point early on on Facebook history, Zuckerberg - nervous about an upcoming report in the Harvard Crimson, used \"TheFacebook\" login data of Crimson staff to crack into their Harvard email accounts to see if the paper was going to include a claim that he had stolen an idea for a TheFacebook feature called \"Visualize Your Buddy.\"","Tim and Elisabeth decided to drop John's claims from the story. But, this time, they decided to go ahead and publish a story on ConnectU's claims against Facebook.","Mark Zuckerberg was not content to wait until the morning to find out if the Crimson would include John's accusations in its story.","Instead, he decided to access the email accounts of Crimson editors and review their emails. How did he do this? Here's how Mark described his hack to a friend:","Mark used his site, TheFacebook.com, to look up members of the site who identified themselves as members of the Crimson. Then he examined a log of failed logins to see if any of the Crimson members had ever entered an incorrect password into TheFacebook.com. If the cases in which they had entered failed logins, Mark tried to use them to access the Crimson members' Harvard email accounts. He successfully accessed two of them.","In other words, Mark appears to have used private login data from TheFacebook to hack into the separate email accounts of some TheFacebook users.","In one account he accessed, Mark saw an email from Crimson writer Tim McGinn to Cameron, Tyler, and Divya. Another email Mark read was this one, from Crimson managing editor Elisabeth Theodore to Tim McGinn:","OK, he did seem very sleazy. And I thought that some of his answers to the questions were not very direct or open. I also thought that his reaction to the website was very very weird. But, even if it's true so what? It's an [redacted] thing to do but it's not illegal, right? -Business Insider","Lo and behold, Mark's cavalier attitude towards Facebook user data is costing him billions at a time he's actively shedding shares as part of a $12 billion liquidation which started last September."],"isopubdate":""}

Speechwriter too","The other night I asked my teenage son to plough through his mountain of homework and finish it by the time I got home. Asked being the crucial word here. That I found him on the PS4 when I returned will come as no surprise to any parent of a teenager.","The next evening I didn’t ask, I compelled him. There was no other option, no get-out clause, no invitation for his subconscious ‘other’ to get away with it.","Asking someone to do something is never going to be the same as telling them. And it is this semantic gulf that has been exercising me after becoming embroiled in a very minor Twitter spat with a writer who contributes to the Guardian.","This is the kind of work, say Guardian cheerleaders, that shows how important it is you fund us. We may be giving the stuff away for free but we’re politely ‘asking’ you to donate. 'A favour' as the Guardian website gently suggests on every page you ever click on. Persuasive, laudable but totally unrealistic. Yes, some will donate – others, like me, may even do the quaint old-fashioned thing of exchanging money for a hard copy. But the majority will do what they’ve always done and plunder it for free.","On Twitter, I asked one of those calling out for Carole-donors if maybe the answer is to charge for such unique and well-researched material, that readers should pay for the privilege. ‘That is why we’re asking you to pay,’ came the slightly patronising response. ‘Don’t ask, tell,’ I replied. Which then led to her lobbing some abuse my way and hastily shutting down the discussion.","There are two broad options for media owners today, she suggested. One is to create material that will attract advertising, the sort favoured by clickbait sites or unashamedly populist ones such as MailOnline. The other ‘is to reject serfdom and build up your own kingdom: attract readers directly to your website, and ask them to pay something, rather than fund your journalism largely through adverts that users can find intrusive and irritating.’","True, except in one small detail. These companies are not asking, they are compelling. Like my teenage son and his homework, asking will not always get the desired response. Telling – forcing? – will. The New Statesman, like The Times, Telegraph, Spectator and many others, is not asking me to contribute, it is compelling me too. And I do pay, it’s a brilliant product.","Thus, there is a third way. Clickbait, paywalls and the Guardian’s model of voluntary donations. Apparently, it’s working. According to the Guardian Media Group’s chief executive David Pemsel, there are 200,000 subscribers and 300,000 members, as well as 300,000 donors from across the world who have made one-off payments. Though he doesn’t say if there is any crossover between the three.","The internet is coincidentally enjoying its teenage years much like my son, and the same problem exists. Asking is not the same as demanding. I doubt whether the Guardian’s fingers-crossed-free model is sustainable. A paywall will soon be erected and brilliant journalism such as Carole’s will cease to be given away for free as part of a cynical attempt to secure more eyeballs.","There was another bit of that Twitter exchange that made me laugh. My opponent said: ‘If enough people give then it might be viable to survive in a…paywall era.’","When I pointed out that we always lived in a paywall era, it’s just that we used to call it a ‘cover price’, she replied that we ‘obviously did not always live in a paywall era…’ before flouncing off to bed in a huff."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

But in the case of Facebook, the social network's Messenger app for iOS apparently tracks quite a bit more than most users likely realize.","iOS forensics and security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski spent Tuesday morning disassembling Facebook Messenger's iOS binary, at one point declaring via Twitter that \"Messenger appears to have more spyware type code in it than I've seen in products intended specifically for enterprise surveillance.\"","In an email, Zdziarski said that Messenger is logging practically everything a user might do within the app, from what and where they tap, to how often a device is held in portrait versus landscape orientation; even time spent in the Messenger app, versus the time it spends running in the background.","Some of this is expected behaviour for an app developer, of course. But of greater concern are the other things Zdziarski discovered, whose intended purpose is less clear.","\"[Facebook is] using some private APIs I didn't even know were available inside the sandbox to be able to pull out your WiFi SSID (which could be used to snoop on which WiFi networks you're connected to) and are even tapping the process list for various information on the device,\" he wrote in an email.","On Twitter, Zdziarski said he's worked for companies that write enterprise surveillance software that didn't know this level of access was possible.","Messenger appears to have more spyware type code in it than I've seen in products intended specifically for enterprise surveillance","Multiple strings discovered by Zdziarski within the binary also have an ominous phrase, [\"DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED\"], tacked onto the end. iPhone hacker Chpwn (also known as Grant Paul), who now works at Facebook chimed in via Twitter to say he was responsible for naming the strings, writing \"the whole thing's an inside joke.\"","However, it's not clear what some of these functions, which have names such as \"globalProviderMapData\" and \"isHeadPublisher\" actually do, and why they would warrant the threat of termination, joking or not, if used.","Zdziarski cautioned that \"a couple hours of tinkering around isn't going to provide any meaningful conclusions… but there is a lot of code that suggests Facebook is running analytics on nearly everything it possibly can monitor on your device.\"","Facebook declined to provide any official comment, but a spokesperson pointed me to the responses of Facebook Messenger developer Lucy Zhang, who told Zdziarski via Twitter that it's \"probably no surprise that we use analytics to understand usage and make the app faster [and] more efficient.\"","She offered one such example where analytics told the team that users were using Like stickers often, \"so we moved that feature so people can send in fewer taps.\"","While it's not out of the ordinary for app developers to run all sorts of analytics on their users to measure how an app is being used, it's often unclear to users just how much data an app is capable of collecting—assuming they're told such data is being collected in the first place.","Even in cases where apps are upfront about permissions—as is the case with Facebook's Android Messenger app—there is still a lack of nuance when explaining what, exactly, granting certain permissions might mean. Facebook faced backlash over its Messenger app for Android in August, when users questioned why the app was requesting access to their device's camera, microphone, text messages and more, naturally assuming the worst.","The reasons turned out to be relatively benign, but the concern should serve as a reminder that it's no longer enough for an app to simply request access to sensitive phone functions and sensors without explanation. Maybe it's part of the hangover since the revelations on the NSA courtesy of Edward Snowden, but app developers such as Facebook, as well as app store owners Apple and Google, have to do a better job at explaining why such access is needed, and how it will be used.","\"Ultimately it comes down to whether or not you trust Facebook not to take advantage of their position on your device to snoop on you,\" wrote Zdziarski. \"The technical capabilities to do so are certainly there.\"","UPDATE: After this article was published, Facebook, which had previously declined to comment, reached out with the following response:","\"These accusations are completely unjustified. Privacy is core to our approach with Messenger, and like any developer, we analyze usage trends to make our apps better, faster, and more efficient. As an example, with regard to what and where people tap - when we noticed that people were using the 'Like' stickers a lot, we modified the app so that people could send them with fewer taps.\""],"isopubdate":"2014-09-10"}

The agency’s deputy director, Thomas D. Homan, said that Ms. Schaaf’s warning had helped “864 criminal aliens and public safety threats” to evade capture in the raid.","Mr. Sessions, in a visit to California last week, condemned Ms. Schaaf, a Democrat, and echoed the agency, asserting that her actions had allowed hundreds to escape.","Mr. Schwab said in interviews, first with The San Francisco Chronicle and then with CNN, that he had been frustrated by the remarks, and had quit “because I didn’t want to perpetuate misleading facts.”","“I asked them to change the information,” he told The Chronicle, referring to the 864 people to whom the statement alluded. “I told them that the information was wrong, they asked me to deflect, and I didn’t agree with that. Then I took some time and I quit.”","He explained that the enforcement agency would have been unlikely to capture all of the roughly 1,000 undocumented immigrants in the area that it had targeted, and that it was incorrect to identify those who were not detained as threats to public safety.","“We were never going to pick up that many people,” he said. “To say that 100 percent are dangerous criminals on the street, or that those people weren’t picked up because of the misguided actions of the mayor, is just wrong.”","Mr. Schwab did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. He resigned last week, according to CNN.","“I just couldn’t bear the burden — continuing on as a representative of the agency and charged with upholding integrity, knowing that information was false,” he told CNN, adding that in his 16 years of experience in government he had never been asked to deflect when he knew something was inaccurate.","In a statement, Ms. Schaaf, whom President Trump criticized last week for alerting residents to the raid, praised Mr. Schwab “for speaking the truth while under intense pressure to lie.”","“Our democracy depends on public servants who act with integrity and hold transparency in the highest regard,” she added.","An official at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, briefed on the plans for the raid said last month that agents find only about 30 percent of their targets on average during large sweeps.","Mr. Schwab told CNN that he thought Ms. Schaaf’s actions were “misguided,” but that blaming her “for 800 dangerous people out there is just false.”","ICE responded to Mr. Schwab’s comments in a statement, saying, “Even one criminal alien on the street can put public safety at risk.”","“As Director Homan stated, while we can’t put a number on how many targets avoided arrest due to the mayor’s warning, it clearly had an impact,” the statement said. “While we disagree with Mr. Schwab on this issue, we appreciate his service and wish him well.”","“If anyone wants to have a public argument over precisely how many dangerous criminal aliens eluded arrest because of the mayor’s irresponsible actions, we are happy to have that debate,” Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said in a statement.","In a 2016 interview, Mr. Schwab told The Marion Press, his hometown paper in Michigan, that he joined the Army after high school and was deployed to Korea for four years.

For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Last year, Equifax was in the news when hackers stole personal information on 150 million people, including Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and driver's license numbers. You certainly didn't give it permission to collect any of that information. Equifax is one of those thousands of data brokers, most of them you've never heard of, selling your personal information without your knowledge or consent to pretty much anyone who will pay for it.Surveillance capitalism takes this one step further. Companies like Facebook and Google offer you free services in exchange for your data. Google's surveillance isn't in the news, but it's startlingly intimate. We never lie to our search engines. Our interests and curiosities, hopes and fears, desires and sexual proclivities, are all collected and saved. Add to that the websites we visit that Google tracks through its advertising network, our Gmail accounts, our movements via Google Maps, and what it can collect from our smartphones.That phone is probably the most intimate surveillance device ever invented. It tracks our location continuously, so it knows where we live, where we work, and where we spend our time. It's the first and last thing we check in a day, so it knows when we wake up and when we go to sleep. We all have one, so it knows who we sleep with.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","See the full visual","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick Guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","See the full visual","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

They lived in the cellular shadows, effectively immune to traditional get-out-the-vote efforts.","For a campaign dependent on a big youth turnout, this could have been a crisis. But the Obama team had a solution in place: a Facebook application that will transform the way campaigns are conducted in the future. For supporters, the app appeared to be just another way to digitally connect to the campaign. But to the Windy City number crunchers, it was a game changer. “I think this will wind up being the most groundbreaking piece of technology developed for this campaign,” says Teddy Goff, the Obama campaign’s digital director.","That’s because the more than 1 million Obama backers who signed up for the app gave the campaign permission to look at their Facebook friend lists. In an instant, the campaign had a way to see the hidden young voters. Roughly 85% of those without a listed phone number could be found in the uploaded friend lists. What’s more, Facebook offered an ideal way to reach them. “People don’t trust campaigns. They don’t even trust media organizations,” says Goff. “Who do they trust? Their friends.”","The campaign called this effort targeted sharing. And in those final weeks of the campaign, the team blitzed the supporters who had signed up for the app with requests to share specific online content with specific friends simply by clicking a button. More than 600,000 supporters followed through with more than 5 million contacts, asking their friends to register to vote, give money, vote or look at a video designed to change their mind. A geek squad in Chicago created models from vast data sets to find the best approaches for each potential voter. “We are not just sending you a banner ad,” explains Dan Wagner, the Obama campaign’s 29-year-old head of analytics, who helped oversee the project. “We are giving you relevant information from your friends.”","Early tests of the system found statistically significant changes in voter behavior. People whose friends sent them requests to register to vote and to vote early, for example, were more likely to do so than similar potential voters who were not contacted. That confirmed a trend already noted in political-science literature: online social networks have the power to change voting behavior. A study of 61 million people on Facebook during the 2010 midterms found that people who saw photos of their friends voting on Election Day were more likely to cast a ballot themselves. “It is much more effective to stimulate these real-world ties,” says James Fowler, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, who co-authored the study.","Campaign pros have known this for years. A phone call or knock on the door from someone who lives in your neighborhood is far more effective than appeals from out-of-state volunteers or robo-calls. Before social networks like Facebook, however, connecting a supportive friend to a would-be voter was a challenge. E-mail, for instance, connects one person to a campaign. Facebook can connect the campaign, through one person, to 500 or more friends.","Because it took more than a year to build the system, it was deployed only in the campaign’s homestretch. The Romney team used a far less sophisticated version of the technology. Political strategists on both sides say that in the future they intend to get the system working sooner in primaries in key states and with more buy-in from supporters, who will have a greater understanding of their role in the process. “Campaigns are trying to engineer what the new door knock is going to look like and what the next phone call is going to look like,” says Patrick Ruffini, a Republican digital strategist who worked on George W. Bush’s 2004 campaign. “We are starting to see.”","And the technology is moving fast. In 2008, Twitter was a sideshow and Facebook had about one-sixth its current reach in the U.S. By 2016, this sort of campaign-driven sharing over social networks is almost certain to be the norm. Tell your friends."],"isopubdate":""}

That's when we learned that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica quietly, deceptively gathered data belonging to more than 50 million Facebook users in 2014.","Cook's silence ended abruptly on Saturday when he fielded a question about the Facebook situation and how it affects his views on data privacy. Speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing, Cook voiced his support for government regulation (h/t Bloomberg).","\"I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,” Cook said. “The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life -- from my own point of view it shouldn’t exist.\"","He went on describe a long-held worry that people aren't necessarily aware of what they're giving away in terms of their personal data when they sign up for one online service or another.","\"We’ve worried for a number of years that people in many countries were giving up data probably without knowing fully what they were doing and that these detailed profiles that were being built of them, that one day something would occur and people would be incredibly offended by what had been done without them being aware of it,\" he said.","\"Unfortunately that prediction has come true more than once.\"","Cook didn't specifically name the United States as one of those \"many countries,\" but he later pointed out \"the countries that embrace openness do exceptional.\"","Weak data privacy laws aren't a uniquely American problem, but -- as the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica situation illustrates -- they are an American problem too.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

But Cambridge Analytica shouldn’t act as a diversion from the real bad guy in this story: Facebook. It is mystifying that as his company regulates the flow of information to billions of human beings, encouraging certain purchasing habits and opinions, and monitoring people’s interactions, Mark Zuckerberg is invited to give lectures at Harvard without being treated with due scepticism.","We have now reached the point where an unaccountable private corporation is holding detailed data on over a quarter of the world’s population. Zuckerberg and his company have been avoiding responsibility for some time. Governments everywhere need to get serious in how they deal with Facebook.","After trolls were sent to jail for sending threatening messages to the activist Caroline Criado-Perez and MP Stella Creasy, a debate ensued over whether the likes of Facebook and Twitter should be classified as platforms or publishers. Facebook is treated as if it is simply a conduit for information, meaning it is not liable for the content its users share – in the same way that BT can’t be sued when people make threatening phone calls.","In 2014 Iain MacKenzie, a spokesperson for Facebook, said, “Every piece of content on Facebook has an associated ‘report’ option that escalates it to your user operations team for review. Additionally, individuals can block anyone who is harassing them, ensuring they will be unable to interact further. Facebook tackles malicious behaviour through a combination of social mechanisms and technological solutions appropriate for a mass-scale online opportunity.”","But the company is evasive about the number of moderators it employs, how they work, and how decisions are made. It has started taking a firmer line on far-right content – recently removing Britain First pages from the site – but it is still resisting many legislative attempts to regulate its content. What content users then see is decided by an algorithm that can change without any consultation, including with the government or the businesses that rely on Facebook for revenue – meaning that some can be quickly wiped off the map. In February 2018 the website Digiday reported on LittleThings, a four-year-old site that shut down overnight after Facebook decided to prioritise user posts over publisher content. A hundred jobs were lost.","Facebook wasn’t the only contributor to LittleThings’ demise, but those working at the website said there was nowhere else to go after the algorithm change. And this isn’t the only example: in 2013 an algorithm change halved the traffic of viral content website Upworthy – something from which the website has never recovered.","The impact of Facebook’s dominance means that publications are constantly scrambling to keep up with the platform’s changing strategy. The editor-in-chief of Wired, Nick Thompson, recently told the Digiday podcast that there was a fear “Facebook has a dial somewhere that can be turned to cut off media that gets too uppity”.","Much has been made of the fact that Facebook creates “filter bubbles”. It has been criticised for prioritising content that users will like – meaning there is less diversity in the news stories people read – and for failing to crack down on propaganda. In fact, Italy’s new far-right star Matteo Salvini explicitly thanked Facebook for contributing to the country’s recent election results.","All this from a company that in 2016 paid just £5.1m in corporation tax on its UK operations, despite profit and revenues nearly quadrupling on the back of increased advertising sales. In December 2017, Facebook announced it would start booking advertising revenue in countries where it was earned, instead of rerouting it via Ireland, although – as this newspaper reported – the move is “unlikely to result in it paying much more tax”. This is despite Zuckerberg calling for governments to start paying a universal basic income for every citizen as a response to automation, driven in part by Silicon Valley.","Even if we want to avoid the site and keep our data protected, it’s not as easy as one might think. According to Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook, the company uses techniques found in propaganda and casino gambling to foster psychological addiction in its users – such as constant notifications and variable rewards. By keeping us hooked, Facebook is able to hold a huge amount of data on us. What is surprising, and worrying, is the derived data Facebook has – the profiles it can build of its users based on seemingly innocuous information. The author of the book Networks of Control, Wolfie Christl, noted that a patent published by Facebook works out people’s commute times by using location data from mobile apps. It then uses this and other data to segregate users into social classes.","Facebook’s massive data cache goes hand in hand with its acquisition of competitors. Nick Srnicek, author of Platform Capitalism, says, “Facebook is acting like a classic monopoly: it’s buying up competitors like Instagram, it’s blatantly copying rivals like Snapchat, and it even has its own app, Onavo, that acts to warn them of potential threats. All of this is combined with an unchecked sweeping up of our data that’s being used to build an impervious moat around its business.”","If ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence. So perhaps it’s time to start treating Facebook as the giant multinational corporation it is – especially because people with Facebook profiles aren’t the company’s customers: they are the product it sells to advertisers."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

In addition, Facebook encourages users to upload their entire address books to the system to \"find your friends,\" and users generally don't appreciate that they may be leaking sensitive information, including nicknames, private numbers, and connections to the system.","Facebook mines this data to create \"shadow profiles\" of its billions of users. These are profiles that are filled with data about you that you have never consciously provided to the system -- data mined from third parties, including your friends, but also those spooky data-brokers. Facebook's shadow profile system was first confirmed in 2013 when it accidentally leaked users' shadow profiles to them along with their own data, something the company says it will never do again out of (ironic) respect for the privacy of the people who provided the data that goes into your shadow profile.","Facebook's shadow profiles are involuntary and there's no opt-out. Facebook has shadow profiles on people who don't use the service. For example, even though I'm not a Facebook user, multiple people have uploaded their address books containing my email and phone number to the system, allowing Facebook to create a profile of my contacts by looking at who lists me as a contact.","What if you don’t like Facebook having this data about you? All you need to do is find every person who’s ever gotten your contact information and uploaded it to Facebook, and then ask them one by one to go to Facebook’s contact management page and delete it.","Just don’t miss anyone. “Once a contact is deleted, we remove it from our system—but of course it is possible that the same contact has been uploaded by someone else,” Steinfeld wrote in an email.","The shadow profiles, like the People You May Know system they feed into, can’t be turned off or opted out of. The one thing you can do to impede Facebook’s contacts-based connections is, through its Privacy Settings menu, keep people from finding your profile by searching your phone number or email address. (Yes, Facebook functions as a reverse phone-number look-up service; under the default settings, anyone can put your phone number into the search bar and pull up your account.)","“Let’s say you’ve shared your phone number [or email address] with a lot of people and don’t want strangers using it to search for you on Facebook,” Steinfeld wrote. “You can limit who can look you up on Facebook by that phone number [or email address] to ‘friends.’ This is also a signal that People You May Know uses. So if a stranger uploads his address book including that phone number [or email address, it] won’t be used to suggest you to that stranger in People You May Know.”","For its 25th anniversary, Wired Magazine asked numerous luminaries to pick a figure from the digital world to celebrate; Edward Snowden chose EFF Pioneer Award Winner Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice and cofounder of the Media Action Grassroots Network, who is one of the leaders in teaching grassroots activists to […]","The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the UK spy agency GCHQ acted illegally when it engaged in mass-scale domestic surveillance of every Briton's electronic communications, a programme that was revealed by documents supplied to journalists by the whistleblower Edward Snowden.","The human eye is a beautiful, incredible thing, but it’s far from perfect, especially when it comes to examining objects up close.

A list of the most popular browsers can be found below.","Digital rights are human rights","We’re all cyborgs in the age of Big Data, but our rights don't extend to the digital shadows we produce","In a speech at last year’s Re:Publica conference in Berlin, software designer and privacy advocate Aral Balkan asked a provocative question: If slavery is the business of buying and selling physical human bodies, “what do you call the business of selling everything else about a person that makes them who they are apart from their physical body?”","Balkan was referring to what Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff calls “surveillance capitalism,” the business logic pioneered by companies such as Google and Facebook that has made our personal data the defining natural resource of the 21st century. Consumers have caught on to this trend: A new Pew poll found that 91 percent of American adults agree that consumers have lost control over how companies collect and use their information.","There’s also a deeper, more disturbing dimension to Balkan’s question that’s best illustrated by a sequence from the British sci-fi series “Black Mirror.”","The vignette begins with a woman preparing to undergo a mysterious medical procedure. Moments later, she awakens in an empty white room. A man — communicating with her through a small egg-like device that sits on a kitchen table — tells her the operation was successful. But like in every episode of the series, the horrible truth quickly comes into view.","It turns out the purpose of the woman’s operation was to create a perfect digital copy of herself, one sharing all her memories, emotions and personality. The woman we’ve been watching in the white room isn’t the woman, but her simulacrum. She was created, the man explains, to be a digital concierge for the “real” woman’s high-tech home — making her food, scheduling her appointments, anticipating her every desire. When she protests, the man — a kind of futuristic home technician — manipulates the egg device to torture the simulated woman, making her experience months of sleepless solitary confinement in a few moments.","The story’s most frightening theme, however, is that simulating humans has consequences for the people being simulated. Later in the episode, police extract a confession from another character by copying him and emotionally manipulating his simulated self inside a virtual environment, which the doppelganger believes to be real. The implication is that anyone in this future can be copied, analyzed and interrogated without their consent.","This particular example of simulated life is, admittedly, a far-fetched dystopian fable. But it’s chillingly prescient in the age of Big Data. Through mass surveillance and data mining, it’s fair to say that anyone who uses the Internet or owns a smartphone is having copies made of their digital identity on a daily basis. Advertisers record our every click and track our physical location as we browse the Web, and data brokerage companies such as Acxiom and Experian then assemble this and countless other personal information (ethnicity, sexual preferences, credit score, family history) into an ersatz simulacrum — a digital shadow invisible to us but accessible to marketers and other unknown entities.","In an information society, the extraction and exploitation of our digital selves profoundly affects how we are perceived and judged.","The rise of Internet-connected devices known as the Internet of Things promises to incorporate even more of our physical lives into these data profiles. The FitBits on our wrists, Google Nest thermostats on our walls and Samsung smart TVs listening in on our living rooms all cast data shadows of their own, recording and quantifying us in novel ways that make our digital simulacra more comprehensive than ever before. This fits with Zuboff’s definition of surveillance capitalism, which is driven by “unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior.”","The critical point is this: Unlike our physical selves, which have all those pesky “human rights,” our digital reflections can be infinitely bought, sold, exploited and experimented on. And the more robust our data selves become, the more effectively those who control them can understand and manipulate us.","Consider the popular uproar over Facebook’s emotional contagion study, in which the social media company secretly experimented on its users by changing how much positive or negative content appeared in their news feeds. Videogame company Riot Games has done similar experiments on players of their hugely popular online game League of Legends, monitoring chats and inserting messages in an attempt to reduce unpleasant behavior and make the hyper-competitive game more palatable to a wider audience.","Of course, steering consumer behavior in the direction of profitability has always been the goal of advertisers and corporations. What’s changed is the explosive availability of personal data from a rapidly expanding variety of sources, which has increased these powers of manipulation by orders of magnitude.","We tend to view data as an abstraction, rather than a part of ourselves. But in an information society where our rights don’t extend to the smartphones in our pockets, the extraction and exploitation of these digital breadcrumbs profoundly affects how we are perceived and judged.","What happens when marketing algorithms study your data shadow and learn to emotionally manipulate you when you’re most vulnerable? Or when your online profile is used to determine whether you’re approved for a loan? Can you say for certain that your simulated self will never negatively affect your credit score, your insurance rates or your ability to find a job? What’s keeping police and intelligence agencies from probing data that’s been gathered about you when that data never technically belonged to you in the first place?","With data-gathering devices now filling our homes and adorning our bodies, it’s no longer a stretch to say we’ve become cyborgs. The problem is our rights as humans and individuals remain largely tied to flesh and blood, allowing corporations and governments to colonize our extended, digital humanity. If we hope to preserve our democracy and autonomy, we must recognize what we call “digital rights” as what they are: Human rights. Because our data is us, whether we realize it or not.","Janus Kopfstein is a journalist and researcher from New York City focused on contemporary themes of surveillance, technology, privacy and power.

He raised the issue of using the death penalty for drug dealers at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month.","The president has repeatedly said individual drug dealers are responsible for thousands of deaths.","Last week, Trump said at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania: 'Think of it, you kill one person you get the death penalty, in many states.","'You kill 5,000 people with drugs, because you're smuggling them in and you're making a lot of money, and people are dying and they don't even do anything.","'Then you wonder why we have a problem, and that's why we have a problem. I don't think we should play games!'","'I never did polling on that, I don't know if that's popular. I don't know if that's unpopular. Probably you'll have some people who say 'Oh that's not nice', Trump continued. 'But these people are killing our kids and killing our families! And we have to do something.'","Trump remarked last week at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania that the nation should consider the death penalty for drug dealers, whose products kill 'thousands'","Trump cited Singapore and China for their 'zero tolerance' policy on drugs.","In fact, 33 countries allow the death penalty for drug offenses, many of them in Asia, according to a 2012 report from Harm Reduction International.","Surprisingly, the US is among them, at least in theory.","In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Kennedy vs Louisiana left open the question of whether the death penalty for 'offenses against the State' including 'drug kingpin activity' would be constitutionally permissible.","The US Code authorizes a sentence of death in certain large-scale federal drug trafficking convictions, even when murder is not a component of the conviction.","But in practice, no criminal has been executed in the US for a crime other than murder since September 1964, when Alabama executed James Coburn for robbery.","In the Philippines, more than 4,000 mostly poor drug suspects have been killed under President Rodrigo Duterte's drug crackdown, according to the national police, although human rights groups have reported larger death tolls.","This map shows countries with capital punishment for drug offenses in red, and countries that allow the death penalty for drug offenses only in special circumstances in yellow.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The social media giant has grown exponentially since the last presidential election, rendering it for the first time a major campaigning tool that has the potential to transform friendship into a political weapon.","Facebook is also being seen as a source of invaluable data on voters. The re-election team, Obama for America, will be inviting its supporters to log on to the campaign website via Facebook, thus allowing the campaign to access their personal data and add it to the central data store – the largest, most detailed and potentially most powerful in the history of political campaigns. If 2008 was all about social media, 2012 is destined to become the \"data election\".","\"Facebook is now ubiquitous,\" says Dan Siroker, a former Google digital analyst who joined Obama's campaign in 2008 and now runs his own San Francisco-based analytics consultancy, Optimizely. \"Whichever candidate uses Facebook the most effectively could win the war.\"","For the past nine months a crack team of some of America's top data wonks has occupied an entire floor of the Prudential building in Chicago devising a digital campaign from the bottom up. The team draws much of its style and inspiration from the corporate sector, with its driving ambition to create a vote-garnering machine that is smooth, unobtrusive and ruthlessly efficient.","Already more than 100 geeks, some recruited at top-flight university job fairs including Stanford, are assembled in the Prudential drawn from an array of disciplines: statisticians, predictive modellers, data mining experts, mathematicians, software engineers, bloggers, internet advertising experts and online organisers.","At the core is a single beating heart – a unified computer database that gathers and refines information on millions of committed and potential Obama voters. The database will allow staff and volunteers at all levels of the campaign – from the top strategists answering directly to Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina to the lowliest canvasser on the doorsteps of Ohio – to unlock knowledge about individual voters and use it to target personalised messages that they hope will mobilise voters where it counts most.","Every time an individual volunteers to help out – for instance by offering to host a fundraising party for the president – he or she will be asked to log onto the re-election website with their Facebook credentials. That in turn will engage Facebook Connect, the digital interface that shares a user's personal information with a third party.","Consciously or otherwise, the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they store publicly on their Facebook page – home location, date of birth, interests and, crucially, network of friends – directly into the central Obama database.","\"If you log in with Facebook, now the campaign has connected you with all your relationships,\" a digital campaign organiser who has worked on behalf of Obama says.","The potential benefits of the strategy can already be felt. The Obama campaign this year has attracted about 1.3 million donors, 98% of whom have contributed $250 or less – that's more than double the number at the same stage in 2008. At this rate, Obama is also well on the way towards staging the world's first billion-dollar campaign.","Under its motto \"Bigger, better, 2012\", the Chicago team intends between now and election day in November to create a campaign powerhouse which will allow fundraisers, advertisers and state and local organisers to draw from the same data source.","Joe Rospars, the campaign's chief digital strategist, told a seminar at the Guardian-sponsored Social Media Week that the aim was to create technology that encourages voters to get involved, in tune with Obama's emphasis on community organising.","Campaign insiders say that the emphasis this year will be on efficiency more than any headline-grabbing technical wizardry. But that should not obscure how significant this year's presidential cycle will be in putting to the test the first custom-made digital campaign.","Mark Sullivan, founder of Voter Activation Network, which manages the Democratic party's central database of voter information known as Vote Builder, says that \"what we will see in 2012 will make 2008 look really primitive\".","Judith Freeman of New Organizing Institute, who worked on both John Kerry's 2004 and Obama's 2008 presidential campaigns, says there is a leap forward in technology every presidential cycle, and 2012 would be no exception. \"There's a deadline – it's got to be done by election day – and that provides a huge push to make things happen.\"","In 2008 the Obama digital team was lauded around the world for its groundbreaking work on internet fundraising. Yet in fact, the separation of its data on voters into several distinct silos forced high-level staffers to spend hours manually downloading information from one database to another.","The Obama team in 2008 did a good job in beginning to tear down those walls, releasing extraordinary fundraising energy in the process that raised about $500m online.","This year the Chicago team hasn't knocked down the walls so much as dispensed with them altogether. They have built from the ground up a unified database that incorporates and connects everything the campaign knows about a voter within it.","Rospars said that in 2012 they no longer had to try to integrate data in the campaign. \"We are just one campaign now – we built it from scratch.\"","The centralised nature of the database may raise privacy issues as the election cycle progresses. Jeff Chester of the digital advertising watchdog Center for Digital Democracy, which has been calling for regulators to review the growth of digital marketing in politics, said that \"this is beyond J Edgar Hoover's dream. In its rush to exploit the power of digital data to win re-election, the Obama campaign appears to be ignoring the ethical and moral implications.\"","But from the vantage point of the campaign the benefits are evident.","\"Fusing your data into one central store is cheaper, quicker and allows you to be more targeted,\" said Jim Pugh, who was part of Obama's 2008 digital team and now works for the progressive online movement, Rebuild the Dream.","The Obama database incorporates Vote Builder, a store of essential information such as age, postal address, occupation and voting history drawn from the voter files of 190 million active voters. It lines up and matches those voter files with data gathered from online interactions with the president's supporters – notably the millions of pieces of information its army of canvassers collected across the nation during the 2008 race, a list of email addresses of supporters that it has amassed and that now stands at about 23 million, as well as the contact information of Obama's 25 million Facebook fans.","Facebook itself has been transformed as a political campaign tool since 2008, simply by dint of its exponential growth. Four years ago there were about 40 million Facebook users in the US; now there are more than 160 million – incorporating almost the entire voting public.","The significance of the fusion of Facebook and voter file data is hard to overemphasise. \"This is the Moneyball moment for politics,\" says Sam Graham-Felsen, Obama's chief blogger in 2008. \"If you can figure out how to leverage the power of friendship, that opens up incredible possibilities.\"","First among those possibilities is that the campaign can distribute customised content designed specifically for its Facebook fans to share with their much wider circle of friends. The messages can be honed to a particular demographic – age, gender, etc – as well as set of interests, and targeted on the most hotly contested parts of the most crucial battleground states.","\"Influencers\" – those people who tend to act as thought leaders among their friends on Facebook – can be identified and prioritised.","Teddy Goff, the digital director of the re-election team, told Social Media Week that as the year progresses there would be more and more \"persuasion through interaction\".","Individual voters would be given access to digital platforms from which they will be able to tell their own stories \"and that's far more powerful than anything we can say\", Goff said. \"That will be the story of this election. People's own stories really moves votes.\"","Goff said the campaign was focused on building relationships through social media. An Obama message would be crafted so that \"not only can it be passed to your friends but to those friends that we think are most in need of passing it on to\".","The bottom line is that if you are sent a message from your Facebook friend encouraging you to turn up to an event or donate to Obama, you are vastly more likely to respond than if the request comes from an anonymous campaign staffer.","The other door that data integration will further open in 2012 is personalised marketing. This has been the Holy Grail of political campaigners for decades: the idea that you can talk directly to voters and serve them customised messages.","In the old world of snail mail, that could be achieved to some degree through direct marketing – ie leaflets dropped into the letter box – but that is expensive and far too slow with today's 24-hour news cycle.","The fusion of information into a centralised database allows you to direct market online at much less cost and virtually instantaneously.","The technique has begun to spread widely among commercial businesses over the past year, and it is only a matter of time before such hyper-targeting is standard across political campaigns. Indeed, we've already started to see it this year.","The Obama campaign has already tailored a single donation request to 26 distinct segments of the voting public. The Republicans are also getting in on the act.","Michele Bachmann used customised online advertising in Iowa to reach Republican voters only, sending to their computers messages with a local spin for each of the state's 99 counties. That helped her win Iowa's vaunted straw poll in August 2011 (though that didn't help her in the long run). Rick Perry sent God-praising commercials to Iowans who listed themselves as evangelicals on Facebook.","The company CampaignGrid, that serves mainly Republican candidates, claims to be able to online market direct to targeted households. It has an integrated database on 110 million voters across America – some 65% of the electorate – to whom it can serve personalised ads, following them wherever they are browsing on the internet.","Jeff Dittus, the company's co-founder, illustrates what this means. He worked on behalf of one unidentified Republican presidential candidate, serving online ads in the Miami-Dade region of Florida specifically to 400,000 individuals who had voted in at least two of the four previous Republican primaries. The adverts were further customised for gender, and for Spanish speaking.","They were distributed to the individuals through internet ad exchanges that allow for instantaneous filtering of users the nanosecond they click onto a video on any one of four million websites. In that flash, if you fitted the criterion you were served with a 30-second pre-roll video from the candidate delivering a message to you that you would have found remarkably personal.","\"I'm sure this is the future of digital political campaigning,\" said CampaignGrid's CEO Jeff Dittus.","Drew Brighton, CEO of TargetSmart Communications, is hoping to do the same hyper-targeting for Democratic and progressive politicians and causes through his new product Target Blue. It matches up the details of up to 50m cookies embedded on individual computers with voter files and uses it to identify Democratic-leaning individuals to whom it can serve customised ads wherever they go on the web.","The company is also developing a system for targeting Democratic voters through their computer IP addresses down to such tightly drawn areas or \"IP zones\" as just 20 households. That allows for micro-targeting depending on the average income bracket, age profile and concerns of that tiny locality.","The elephant in the room, of course, is television, which continues to dominate advertising spending by political campaigns. Most analysts agree that 2012 has come too soon for any equally transformative leaps forward in targeted or \"addressable\" TV advertising.","Cable television can close in on geographic zones ranging from a few thousand to up to 100,000 viewers allowing campaigns to shape their messages to those clusters. The tighter the geographical area that can be drawn, the more efficient the TV advertising becomes as campaign managers can focus on primarily-Democratic, Republican or independent neighbourhoods.","But its still a relatively blunt instrument. The prize would be to be able to fuse cable subscriptions with voter files so that TV adverts could be sent to households of a specific political persuasion.","Technically, that's already possible. Comcast Spotlight, the advertising arm of Comcast Cable, has run trials of commercial as opposed to political addressable advertising in Baltimore. Adverts custom-made to speak to various demographic groups were piped into 60,000 identified households, though the personal details were removed to protect privacy.

Choosing to delete your Facebook account is a little too drastic for most users, so Mozilla came up with an alternative. If you use the Firefox browser, it's now easy to stop Facebook tracking you around the web.","Announced on The Mozilla Blog today, a new add-on for the Firefox browser has been launched called Facebook Container. When installed, it stops Facebook from tracking you around the web, but importantly, allows Facebook to function as normal when you're actually using the social network.","Mozilla achieved this by isolating your Facebook identity and placing it in a separate container to the rest of your browsing experience. By doing so, it's much harder for Facebook to track any visits to other websites through third-party cookies.","As Nick Nguyen, VP of Firefox Product explains, the aim here was to offer, \"A solution that doesn't tell users to simply stop using a service that they get value from. Instead, it gives users tools that help them protect themselves from the unexpected side effects of their usage.\"","Related","If you are worried about the data being collected about you, but don't want to stop using the social network, Facebook Container is a great solution for protecting yourself. It's also a good reason to install and start using the Firefox browser if you haven't already.","Once installed, you'll know the add-on is working by the blue Facebook and lock symbol that appears in the address bar when visiting Facebook, just like in the image above.","About the Author","Matthew is PCMag's UK-based editor and news reporter.

The second issue is the wholesale destruction and elimination of personal privacy, which is becoming one of the most powerful political and business issues of our times.","Zuckerberg, Facebook’s management and investors and the leadership and ownership of all similar technology companies should understand that doing what is right for America and democracy will also be right for the financial success of their companies.","There is a commonality of interest, not a conflict of interest, between Zuckerberg’s duty as a patriotic American and Zuckerberg’s duty to investors and employees of Facebook.","It would be far better if these companies would immediately begin very aggressive self-regulation, to avoid excessive government regulation that will surely come if private firms do not act soon.","The evisceration and destruction of personal privacy is one of the great scandals of modern life, which affects every citizen of every democracy and every dictatorship.","Big Brother is watching us, whether Big Brother is government weaponizing our personal information to control our behavior, political campaigns weaponizing our personal information to influence how we vote or business weaponizing our personal information to persuade us to buy the products and services they sell.","Aren’t you fed up with being asked to read lengthy legalistic disclosures in small print that are impossible to decipher but constitute the surrender of privacy that should be protected, instead, by a clear new privacy bill of rights?","Memo to Zuckerberg and other technology leaders: Any company that develops the reputation of failing to protect the privacy of its users will face a powerful backlash from its users and a decline in market valuation of their companies.","Conversely, if Zuckerberg and leaders of similar companies — or new competitors seeking to take away their business — develop the reputation of being champions of the privacy of their users, their companies will reap a huge financial reward in expanded business and rising market valuations.","The smart, just move for Zuckerberg is to show industry leadership by practicing radical transparency by fully cooperating with investigators, disclosing all facts of interest to customers and leading the charge for a full-scale new bill of rights for the privacy of all internet users.","What is right for America is right for Facebook.","Brent Budowsky was an aide to former Sen.

But what if the world Facebook shows them is wildly distorted?","That's the question raised after a former employee of a data mining firm that worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign alleged the company used Facebook to bombard specific individuals with misinformation in hopes of swaying their political views.","Advertisement","The accusations raised alarm across the Atlantic on Monday, sparking an investigation into the firm, Cambridge Analytica, by the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office. In the U.S., Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent a letter asking Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg whether the social media giant was aware of other data violations on its platform, and why it failed to take action sooner.","The controversy drove Facebook's stock price down nearly 7% on Monday, suggesting that investors are feeling skittish about the regulatory liabilities of a company that has spent the last year dogged by questions of fake news and Russian propaganda.","The scope of Facebook's problems ballooned after Christopher Wylie, a political strategist who used to work for Cambridge Analytica, alleged on NBC's \"Today\" show Monday that the firm believed that if it could \"capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what's actually happening.\"","By mining Facebook user data, Wylie said, the company could tailor the ads and articles individual users would see — a practice he calls \"informational dominance.\"","In a video secretly recorded by Britain's Channel 4, Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica's political division, suggests users targeted by the firm wouldn't know their online experience was being manipulated.","\"We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet ... and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again … like a remote control,\" he said. \"It has to happen without anyone thinking, 'that's propaganda,' because the moment you think 'that's propaganda,' the next question is, 'who's put that out?'\"","Turnbull, according to Channel 4, also bragged about the firm's practice of recording politicians in compromising situations with bribes and sex workers.","In a statement sent to The Times, Cambridge Analytica accused Channel 4 of entrapment and rejected the allegations made in the report. In a separate statement, also issued Monday, the firm said it did not carry out \"personality targeted advertising\" for President Trump's campaign.","The company obtained the Facebook data linked to 50 million accounts through a Cambridge University psychology professor who had permission to gather information on users of the social media platform, but violated Facebook guidelines by passing it on to a third party for commercial purposes. Although Cambridge Analytica said in a news release over the weekend that it deleted the data as soon as it learned it had broken Facebook's rules, Wylie alleged that the firm continued to use the information.","What's worrisome about Cambridge's alleged practice, say social media and psychology experts, is that it works on even the most rational of people.","\"Attribution theory teaches us that if you hear the same thing from multiple sources, then you start believing that it might be true even if you originally questioned it,\" said Karen North, a social media professor at USC who has also studied psychology.","In Cambridge Analytica's case, Wylie on Monday accused the firm of going beyond simply serving targeted ads to people on Facebook. He alleged that the firm \"works on creating a web of disinformation\" so that unwitting consumers are confronted with the same lies and false stories both on and off Facebook.","\"Even if you thought it was just one biased person or one paid ad, when you start to see it everywhere, you start thinking there's a critical mass of people or experts that buy into the same position,\" North said. \"You start to believe there must be a groundswell of support for it.\"","The ability to target ads at individuals isn't unique to Facebook. But what makes the social media giant's role profound is the breadth and depth of information it collects and the sheer number of people who use the service. Last year 67% of Americans told Pew Research that they get at least some of their news on social media. In 2016, 64% of those who got their news from social media got it from only one source — most commonly Facebook.","Advertisement","Since the 2012 presidential campaign, Facebook has been the \"number one destination\" for digital media strategists looking to influence politics, according to Laura Olin, a digital strategist who ran social media strategy for former President Obama's reelection campaign.","Prior to that election, campaigns spread their focus among Facebook, Twitter and traditional media outlets, she said. But in 2012, three things became clear:","People were spending more of their online time on Facebook than anywhere else.","It reached a broader demographic than its competitors.","Ads could be targeted more effectively on Facebook than on other platforms.","The Obama campaign that year was able to aim advertisements and messages at voters based on gender, location and existing political beliefs.","\"We showed people what it could look like,\" said Olin, who ran Obama's Facebook pages during the campaign. \"From there, people realized they could use paid advertising to reach voters in a targeted way. I feel some guilt over any potential part I might have played in that.\"","Digital media experts such as Olin worry that the growing influence of misinformation on Facebook is likely to get worse before it gets better.","In 2013, 47% of Americans used Facebook as a source for news, according to research from Pew. In 2016, that number had grown to 63%. Facebook itself has nearly 2.2 billion people who visit its website and app every month, and its subsidiaries continue to grow, with Instagram commanding nearly a billion monthly active users, WhatsApp recording more than a billion users, and Messenger at more than 900 million users.","The social network has pledged to more than double its current team of 10,000 content moderators by the end of 2018 to keep false and misleading information in check. But with hundreds of millions of photos, videos and articles uploaded to Facebook every day, safety and security experts question whether this will be enough.","Despite the rampant misinformation on the platform, users flock to it, North said. Policing its platform will be especially hard for Facebook, she said, because the tools used for propaganda — the wealth of information it collects and its micro-targeted advertisements — are the same ones Facebook uses to generate revenue.","Gathering and selling access to that kind of granular data helped increase Facebook's advertising revenue last year by 49%. Advertising accounted for more than 98% of Facebook's total revenue in 2017, according to company filings.","Advertisement","And so despite Facebook's share price dropping $12.53 on Monday to $172.56 after the Cambridge Analytica allegations, multiple analysts maintained a \"buy\" rating on the company's stock.","\"What's important to understand is that all social media platforms can be 'weaponized,' so this is not limited to Facebook by any means,\" analysts at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. said in a note to investors.","Or, as Olin put it: \"No one thinks of themselves as a fake news consumer. We all assume we're smarter than that.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","See the full visual","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick Guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","See the full visual","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

He'd heard the stories about privacy violations, knew his friends and family spent too much time bickering there. And until three years ago, he'd managed to steer clear of the largest social network in the world.","But when his daughter went back to school after being accepted at the University of Texas at Austin, he found he had no choice.","\"UT has a parents' organization, and we went to their dog and pony show,\" said Ramirez, who's 64. \"The good news was that they had a way for parents to ask questions, get answers and talk to other parents. The bad news was, they did this through Facebook.\"","Facebook has become the social backbone for families, friends, businesses and groups with common interests in the United States. But those who rely on Facebook face a dilemma. The Cambridge Analytica scandal made abundantly clear what many have known for a long time - that Facebook makes its money by learning as much as it can about each user, then selling that information to advertisers who target specific groups.","more techburger","The scandal prompted the CEO of Cambridge Analytica to be fired by his board of directors. Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg, after several days of silence, posted a mea culpa online last week and went on a media blitz to apologize. Meanwhile, the hashtag #DeleteFacebook continues to trend high on Twitter","Ramirez is one of those who are angered at what has happened. Once his daughter graduates, he said, his plan is to sign off for good.","Or is it?","\"Every now and then I get a new message from a friend, or suggestion to follow someone I haven't seen for years, or I see a really nice post from my daughter,\" Ramirez said. \"And so, no, I am not certain what I am going to do.\"","Even those who are outraged at Facebook's behavior and feel their personal information has been abused are having a hard time walking away.","The phrase \"I'd love to get off Facebook but . . .\" is everywhere. What follows the \"but\" is a myriad of reasons, both emotional and practical.","So what happens if you walk away from Facebook?","You lose track of your those cute photos of your sister's kids. You no longer get updates on the health of your seventh grade teacher who's still an inspiration for you. Invitations to parties are harder to send and wedding photo blasts are more cumbersome. When you wake up in the morning and reach for the iPhone next to your bed, your news sources are a lot harder to find.","(FILES) In this file photo taken on March 25, 2015 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the F8 summit in San Francisco, California. The social media giant has been pounded by criticism at home and abroad over revelations that a firm working for Donald Trump's presidential campaign harvested and misused data on 50 million members.Calls for investigations came on both sides of the Atlantic after Facebook responded to explosive reports of misuse of its data by suspending the account of Cambridge Analytica, a British firm hired by Trump's 2016 campaign. Zuckerberg has been called to appear before the U.S. Congress.","Photo: JOSH EDELSON, AFP/Getty Images","You will have to set up all new logins for many of your apps and favorite websites, because you used Facebook's Platform feature to avoid thinking up yet another password. You won't be able to correct your favorite uncle's Neanderthal-era political views. Your friends from college won't know you've gotten a promotion, broken up with your boyfriend or got laid off from your job.","If you cut yourself off from Facebook, you are . . . cut off from the web of your life.","But leaving Facebook also means you'll no longer see those creepy ads for underwear for two weeks after buying a pack on Amazon. When you get off the plane for an hourlong layover, you won't get notifications about what your Facebook acquaintances are doing in that town right now.","You'll no longer be prompted to friend your ex, or see the face of your brother who died two years in Facebook's friend suggestions. You won't have to worry about what is happening with your private information, and that the details of your life are being misused for profit or political gain.","As is often the case with the convenience of technology, there's a tradeoff. In Facebook's case, you're able to enjoy its benefits for free because your hearts and minds are what's being sold.","Chris Ferguson, a professor of psychology at Stetson University in DeLand, Fla., says Facebook makes it much easier to have social interactions with people who are close to you, as well as those with whom you've lost contact. On the other hand, it also can drive people apart as they clash over views and behavior.","\"Most people have a love-it-but-hate-it relationship with Facebook,\" Ferguson said. \"That's been coming to a head in the last week or two. But it's so easy to keep in touch with a broad range of people that you otherwise just wouldn't. The genius of Facebook is that it's so easy. You don't have to write letters anymore.\"","And that ease-of-use applies to multiple tasks, he said. It's a simple click or tap to do what used to be a complex social task, like sending out invitations, announcing an engagement or sharing vacation photos. Ferguson says Facebook has been developed to be the \"Swiss Army knife\" of social network.","Then there is all the feedback and affirmation in likes and comments. Ferguson said Facebook makes people feel good about themselves.","\"You can present real-life events to real people, tell them about the things you are proud of,\" he said. \"There is evidence to suggest that this type of behavior is associated with positive mental health outcomes.\"","But there's a dark side. Other studies have indicated that looking at the better lives of others might be a drag for those whose own paths are rocky. Social media use has been linked to depression and, in some controversial studies, even suicide.","A lot of Facebook's stickiness also has to do with something called the network effect - the more participants in a network, the more valuable it is. The idea, first expressed regarding the telephone system, is that every time you add a person to a group or network, it increases the value the network brings to all the other participants.","With 2.2 billion users around the world, Facebook is a powerful example of how the network effect works. When you join Facebook, there's an excellent chance that many people you know are already there, and when you connect with them, you add value to their lives, and vice versa.","In the U.S., Facebook's ubiquity is astonishing for a service that's been around for less than 15 years, and only open to the general public for 12 years. According to the Pew Research Center, 89 percent of Americans have internet access, and 68 percent of adults have Facebook accounts. Facebook's own numbers put the percentage at about 74 percent, or about 240 million people.","Of course, no one communicates with all 2.2 billion Facebook members - well, except maybe Mark Zuckerberg - but there's a pretty good chance most people you want to talk to are on it. Yes, you could leave, but where would you go? No other social network has the critical mass that Facebook does.","Ferguson said that would be a sticking point even if something dramatically better than Facebook appeared.","\"To recreate my network, that 500 or 600 followers I have on Facebook, would be hard. It took six or seven years to get to that point,\" he said. \"Moving to a new network would take a tremendous amount of work.\"","When Robert Ramirez joined he was surprised to find Facebook recommending so many of his colleagues from his days at Shell.","\"I follow some nieces and nephews, and my sister, and one former co-worker,\" Ramirez said. \"I am really grateful for being able to follow that one co-worker. Facebook enabled us to get back in contact.\"","Reading the various comments from members about about not being able to delete their Facebook accounts surfaces a myriad of reasons.","There's the woman who appreciates the fact that, when she sends an invitation to a party or event, she doesn't have to worry about whether email addresses are valid. Or the man who said he landed a job after a layoff because of his network on Facebook. Or the woman who thought she was alone in dealing with her special-needs child until she discovered a Facebook group of parents struggling with the same issues.","And there is Liana Silva, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Houston who was born and grew up in Puerto Rico. She still has friends and family there, including her parents, and Facebook is how she keeps track of everyone.","\"I can post a picture of my daughter, and my parents don't have 500 or 600 friends they follow, so that picture shows up for them right away,\" Silva said. \"And other people see, it and then here are these people commenting on my daughter's picture.\"","Silva has been thinking about walking away from Facebook, saying the Cambridge Analytica data leak is \"scary\". But then she thinks about Hurricane Maria and its devastation of the island where she grew up.","\"After the hurricane, it was weeks before I found out my parents were OK, and I first heard from them over the phone,\" she said. \"But with everyone else, I learned they were OK from Facebook.\"","Despite that, she is still tempted to pull the plug.","\"This isn't new for Facebook.

It says it has been doing so with users permission, but it’s not that simple.","People who explicitly “opted in” to allowing Facebook to harvest their cell phone data did so by agreeing to let the company import their phone contacts so they could use Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android phones — but it was not obvious to many users that they were agreeing to have their cell phone records logged when they agreed to import their contacts to use those apps on their Android phones.","The company defended itself by explaining that “people have to expressly agree to use” the opt-in feature for importing their contacts on Messenger or Facebook Lite to allow Facebook to collect the cell phone data, but Sunday’s statement is the first time the social media company actually spelled out that practice in clear terms for users.","“When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the statement reads. “For Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose ‘learn more’ or ‘not now’. On Facebook Lite, the options are to turn it on or ‘skip’. If you chose to turn this feature on, we will begin to continuously log this information, which can be downloaded at any time using the Download Your Information tool.”","This circumspect cell phone data harvesting came to light via Twitter as users began posting their personal records downloaded from Facebook, offering incontrovertible evidence the company had indeed been collecting the data.","Oh wow my deleted Facebook Zip file contains info on every single phone cellphone call and text I made for about a year- cool totally not creepy.","The social media juggernaut does say that people who no longer want to use this opt-in feature can disable it in settings, and it claims that doing so triggers all of the call and text histories that were previously logged to be deleted.","“If, at any point, you no longer wish to continuously upload this information, you can easily turn this feature off in your settings,” the statement says. “You can also turn off continuous call and text history logging while keeping contact uploading enabled.”","Facebook also said in its statement that users’ information “is securely stored and we do not sell this information to third parties,” but last week’s scandal involving U.K. political data firm Cambridge Analytica highlighted that the company has in fact been vulnerable to manipulation by the outside companies it voluntarily shares information with.","The company’s stock has dropped more than 14% in a little over a week since the news broke that Cambridge Analytica was improperly harvesting data via a third-party company that Facebook willingly gave user data to. Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized in a statement on the social platform, as well as in a full-page newspaper ad, but the fallout appears to be continuing as the #DeleteFacebook hashtag continues to trend on social media, and high-profile users like Elon Musk delete their company pages.","SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT","You May Like","Read More","Sign Up for Our Newsletters","Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know now on politics, health, money and more"],"isopubdate":""}

The new features follow fierce criticism of the social network giant after it was revealed that the personal data of tens of millions of users was harvested by a British firm linked to Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The company acknowledged that it needed to “do more to keep people informed,” but said the changes have been “in the works for some time.” “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find,” chief privacy officer Erin Egan and deputy general counsel Ashlie Beringer said in a blog post. “We’re taking additional steps in the coming weeks to put people more in control of their privacy.” The updates include easier access to Facebook’s user settings and tools to easily search for, download and delete personal data stored on the site used by two billion people. Facebook said a new privacy shortcuts menu will allow users to quickly increase account security, manage who can see their information and activity on the site, and control advertisements they see.

{"originalurl":"http://focus.forsythe.com/articles/562/Addressing-the-EU-GDPR-and-New-York-Cybersecurity-Requirements-3-Keys-to-Success","title":"Addressing the EU GDPR & New York Cybersecurity Requirements: 3 Keys to Success","text":["Addressing the EU GDPR & New York Cybersecurity Requirements: 3 Keys to Success","The EU Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and New York State Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies (NY Cybersecurity Requirements) represent a landmark change in the global data protection space. While they originate in different countries and apply to different organizations, their primary message is the same:","Protect your data, or pay a steep price. More specifically, protect the sensitive data you collect from customers.","What is behind these sweeping new data protection and data privacy laws? In a word, cybercrime. In today’s digital world, we are all “data subjects”. Critical aspects of our lives are determined by the data that is held about us, and as evidenced by the daily news cycle, that data is more at risk than ever. The threat landscape is increasingly dangerous, and new technologies are distributing sensitive data farther across locations, devices, and repositories.","According to Gemalto's Breach Level Index, 1,792 data breaches led to almost 1.4 billion data records being compromised worldwide during 2016, an increase of 86 percent over 2015. And Verizon's 2016 Data Breach Investigations Report found that in 93 percent of cases where data was stolen, systems were compromised in minutes or less. Organizations, meanwhile, took weeks or more to discover that a breach had even occurred — and it was typically customers or law enforcement that sounded the alarm, not their own security measures.","Traditional prevention and detection methods are being bypassed, and many organizations either don’t know what to do, or don’t have the right resources in place to advance their security. Regulations such as the GDPR and NY Cybersecurity Requirements represent efforts to ensure that organizations are taking the right steps to protect sensitive data.","\"These strong, first-in-the-nation protections will help ensure this industry has the necessary safeguards in place\" to protect businesses and clients \"from the serious economic harm caused by these devastating cyber-crimes.\" -New York Governor Andrew Cuomo","NY Cybersecurity RequirementsThe New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) 23 NYCRR 500 Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies is a series of regulations that require financial services organizations doing business in New York — which include banks and trust companies, insurance companies, mortgage lenders, investment companies, brokers and other financial services providers — to further enhance their security and privacy programs in an effort to, as Governor Cuomo put it, “protect consumers and ensure that its systems are sufficiently constructed to prevent cyberattacks to the fullest extent possible.”","Minimum security standards are required to be met, including but not limited to the following:","The rules took effect on March 1, 2017 and include a 180-day grace period for compliance. Organizations must submit a statement to New York's Superintendent of Financial Services that certifies compliance by February 15 each year (starting in 2018), and must adhere to the following transition periods for specific requirements:","• One year to comply with the CISO reporting requirement, penetration testing and vulnerability assessment, risk assessment, multi-factor authentication, and awareness training requirements","• Two years to comply with third party service provider security program oversight and policy review","The EU General Data Protection RegulationThe GDPR, agreed upon by the European Parliament and Council in April 2016, is replacing the Data Protection Directive 95/46/ec as the primary law regulating how companies protect EU citizens' personal data. It contains new obligations, and applies to all companies processing and holding the personal data of data subjects residing in the European Union, regardless of the company’s location.","Companies that are already in compliance with the Directive must ensure that they’re compliant with the new GDPR requirements; those that fail to do so will be subject to stiff penalties and fines. The May 25, 2018 compliance deadline, which from an IT planning and management perspective is right around the corner, has U.S. organizations that offer goods and services to EU citizens scrambling.","In PwC’s recent GDPR Preparedness Pulse Survey, nearly all of the respondents (92 percent) considered compliance with Europe’s landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) a top priority on their data-privacy and security agenda in 2017 — with over half of respondents saying it is “the” top priority and 38% saying it is “among” top priorities.","Through the GDPR, the EU intends to give its citizens more control over how their personal data is used, and provide businesses with a clearer legal structure by standardizing data protection law across the EU.","Some of the key privacy and data protection requirements of the GDPR are highlighted below:","If you are unsure whether these regulations apply to your organization, you may need to engage the services of privacy consultants, and/or experienced privacy and technology-focused lawyers.","How can organizations that are impacted by these regulations implement the necessary changes for compliance?","Three Keys to SuccessWhether it’s the NY Cybersecurity Requirements, the GDPR or other data protection and privacy regulations, efforts should be focused on discovering and identifying regulated data, and then managing and protecting it. While there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach, the majority of requirements in these regulations can be met through the development and/or maturation of programs many large enterprises have already begun to implement: data-centric security, incident response, and third-party risk management.","1. Data-Centric SecurityIt is no longer enough to focus IT security efforts on networks and endpoints. As IT changes continue to occur, organizations need to keep pace and advance their security by focusing on the data itself through a data-centric security program. The development of a robust data-centric security program is invaluable not only to the GDPR and NY Cybersecurity Requirements, but to all data protection and data privacy efforts.","A comprehensive data-centric security strategy includes the following components:","Several aspects of data-centric security are particularly important to compliance readiness for regulations such as the GDPR and NY requirements, including data discovery, data classification, IAM, data governance and encryption.","Data DiscoveryMany organizations don’t even know where their sensitive information is, which makes it extremely difficult to comply with requirements such as the GDPR “right to be forgotten”. You need to identify the regulated data you store and process, its location, its path from point A to point B, which systems it is being processed by, etc. Data discovery tools provide visibility into the location, volume, context and risk associated with sensitive, unstructured data across the enterprise — both on-premises and in the cloud.","Data ClassificationData classification policies and tools facilitate the separation of valuable information that may be targeted from less valuable information. Information is divided into predefined groups that share a common risk, and the corresponding security controls required to secure each group type are detailed. Data classification tools can be used to improve the treatment and handling of sensitive, regulated data, and promote a culture of security that helps to enforce data governance policies and prevent inadvertent disclosure. Classification metadata can be ingested by data loss prevention (DLP), encryption and other security solutions to determine which information is sensitive, and how it should be protected.","Identity and Access Management (IAM)The NY requirements specify the use of multi-factor, risk-based authentication “for any individual accessing the Covered Entity's internal networks from an external network (500.12)” and as a means for protecting sensitive data. Multi-factor solutions and services, including mobile device-based authentication products and single sign-on federated access controls can help.","Data GovernanceThe NY requirements obligate organizations to ensure that confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems are the predominant focus of their cybersecurity program. This requirement drives organizational practices towards defining and implementing policies, processes, and standards for the effective use and management of data (structured/unstructured) and information systems. Utilizing GRC tools can help to automate governance processes, and optimize the business value of data. Effective data governance enables organizations to address data privacy and data protection requirements no matter where the data is collected, resides or is consumed.","EncryptionThe NY requirements call for greater use of encryption for data at rest and data in motion. End-to-end encryption maximizes data protection regardless of whether the data is in a public or private cloud, on a device, or in transit. It can be invaluable in the effort to combat advanced threats, protect against IoT-enabled breaches, and maintain regulatory compliance. Enterprise key management solutions are an important accompaniment to encryption tools, helping to securely generate, store and monitor keys, and streamline ongoing administration. In the case of the EU GDPR, organizations that experience a personal data breach that have encrypted the data will be able demonstrate that the breach is unlikely to affect the rights and freedoms of the data subjects; breaches of encrypted data therefore may not require data subject notification.","2. Incident ResponseHistorically, too much IT security spending has focused on the prevention of data breaches, and not enough has gone towards preparing for the inevitable.","Prevention alone fails: just read the data breach headlines making news on a weekly — if not daily — basis.","Detection alone fails: consider the fact that the majority of incidents are detected externally by law enforcement such as the FBI, not internally by the victim organizations themselves.","What’s left when all else fails? Incident response.","An established incident response plan is mandated by the NY Cybersecurity Requirements, and both the GDPR and NY requirements contain 72-hour data-breach notification mandates, which will require dramatic changes to the plans of organizations not accustomed to responding to security incidents within strict timelines.","How can you gauge your organization’s IR capabilities?","Consider the following questions:","• Do you have an incident response program in place?","• Are employees aware of what constitutes an incident to begin with, and how to report and manage an incident?","• Have you optimized the tools you’re using today to protect against and detect incidents?","• Has your program been updated and tested to support today’s cyber threats and compliance with breach notification requirements?","• Does the executive team know their role and what is expected of them?","• Do you have the tools and relationships in place to accelerate your response to a serious security incident for containment and public management?","• Does your plan include considerations for retaining forensic, and public relation firms that directly align to your cybersecurity insurance policy?","Professional services such as security program assessments can help organizations focus on their ability to detect and respond to security incidents, formally document the workflow required to triage and manage the incidents impacting the environment, and improve the processes that support current incident concerns. Compromise assessments help to determine if there has already been an incident or an incident is currently in progress. Additionally, interactive tabletop exercises and breach simulations — in conjunction with forensic and incident response “emergency services” partnerships — can also be of great value.","3. Third-Party RiskThird parties can present your greatest area of risk exposure — both for data security, and for regulatory compliance. It is therefore important to extend your focus beyond the organization’s figurative four walls, and consider the impact of your “extended enterprise”. The ramifications of the GDPR and NY requirements broaden significantly when you think about all of the third parties that are essential to your daily operations.","Carefully monitor the security practices of partners and vendors — engaging in third-party due diligence and periodic assessments — to ensure that cybersecurity requirements have been met throughout your supply chain.","Under the GDPR, third parties may be considered regulated “data processors”, and are thereby subject to the directive. For example, if you are a retailer that collects customer information, which you then share with a third-party call center, then under the GDPR you are the data controller, and the call center is the data processor; you both need to maintain compliance. The NY regulations have an extensive section dedicated to having companies “implement written policies and procedures designed to ensure the security of Information Systems and Nonpublic Information that are accessible to, or held by, Third-Party Service Providers.”","Elements of a Third-Party Risk ProgramDeveloping and implementing a third-party risk/compliance program is essential not only to your compliance efforts, but to your overall security posture.","Several key elements of a successful program appear below:","Third-party security tools can enhance your efforts by providing automated vendor risk assessment, and continuous vendor threat monitoring. Additionally, security scoring tools can help to assess both third-party security, and your own by using predictive analytics and security risk assessment tools to issue either FICO-like scores, or grades ranging from A to F to help predict the organization’s likelihood of a breach.","People, Process & TechnologyIn order to successfully address data protection and privacy regulations and maintain a competitive advantage, the critical components of all enterprise initiatives should be well-considered: people, process and technology.","Professional security assessments are a best practice that is required by both regulations. The NY requirements call for a “Risk Assessment” to which the overall program and policy are explicitly tied, and the GDPR mandates a “Data Protection Impact Assessment”. These services can help your organization determine an actionable roadmap for achieving compliance, and maturing your overall data protection capabilities.","The Benefits of Being PreparedFor many organizations, building and operating a cutting edge data protection program hasn’t been a top priority. Requirements such as the GDPR and NY Cybersecurity Requirements are ushering in a new era of accountability, in which every regulated organization that collects, stores and uses sensitive customer data needs to raise the bar to meet new standards. As UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said during a lecture in January, “We’re all going to have to change how we think about data protection.” As arduous as this may seem, there are benefits. Organizations that mature their data protection capabilities with robust data-centric security, incident response and third-party risk programs can enhance their brand reputation, and are likely to be more resilient going forward. Taking extra care in how you collect, store, and use sensitive data will help you stay prepared as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, and reduce the likelihood and impact of data breaches on your business.","Policy for Comments","Readers are solely responsible for the content of the comments they post here.

Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebook’s official post.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” the added language argued.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","While the language is up for debate, lawmakers don’t appear to be looking kindly on Facebook’s arguably legitimate effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)","While most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I’ve called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.","On Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”","Just what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Except the company wasn't really abusing anything and is just really really good at grabbing all of your data and that's just as important. It went pretty much like so:","Old versions of the Android READ_CONTACTS API bundled your call logs with a contact into the data about the contact itself.","Facebook wants you up upload your contacts so you can see others who also have the Facebook app installed (and can spam the ones who don't) and someone noticed that they could scrape the call logs and get information about who you called, who called you, when, and how long you talked.","Facebook being Facebook didn't bother to tell you it was doing this, but did say in their privacy policy that you can see and remove any data they have about you if you like so technically they were above the board here.","Android was updated and access to call logs was split out of the READ_CONTACTS permission.","The old permission still applied if you had an old phone, didn't revoke it yourself by reinstalling the Facebook app, or had a version of Facebook that was baked in and you didn't have any control over any of this to start with.","When you finally did update and saw the new permissions, you probably didn't read them and tapped install anyway. If you did read them, you probably didn't understand them and didn't bother to find out what they meant.","Zuckerberg buys a volcanic island and begins plans for his doomsday device. Probably.","I'll start by saying what we're all thinking and can all agree on: that's all seriously messed up. But a lot of it is our own fault and that's not something anyone wants to talk about.","Google may be able to \"fix\" this but then we shift trust and responsibility from one company that makes billions from our data to another.","Google should have never let this happen. Another thing most will agree with but is that really what we want? Google cannot see the future nor read anyone's mind. Some of the smartest people in tech work for Facebook and they simply found a way to game a system and they did until they had to stop. You can bet that there are smart people working at places like Facebook and trying to game the current system, too, because your data is what makes these companies worth billions of dollars. More of your data equals more dollars and if you can bring in more dollars to the company you work for some of it trickles down to you. And it's not Google's responsibility to monitor what you install and what you don't; it's only there to enforce the rules as best it can and update the rules when it thinks of a better way.","We also can't ignore that people have been telling us all that Facebook was a super shady company for a long time. This isn't even the first time the call-log scraping has been brought up to mostly deaf ears. And we've been told to read permissions and EULAs and everything else we have to agree with before we tap the Yes/Install/DO IT NOW buttons and largely ignored that advice, too. We've been given plenty of information that should have made us take a closer look at what Facebook was doing and most of us chose to ignore it because we didn't understand much of it or simply didn't care.","It's obvious that this all wasn't good enough or that nobody cared. We don't need to look any further than Facebook's current permissions that include the ability to pull all of the data from your call history and then check to see how many installs the app has to prove it. It's right there in black and white now and has been for a while, but people either trusted that Facebook would never do such a thing, didn't bother to even look at the permissions, or saw them and installed the app anyway.","I think and sincerely hope that it's just the difficulty of keeping track of it all and not that nobody cares.","Picking on Facebook is easy because it is so bad. But all of this goes for every app on every screen.","What's less obvious is how it can be fixed. If you're that person who doesn't care what type of information Facebook has on you and is OK with them doing whatever they like with it, you have nothing to worry about here. Please be sure to delete me from your contacts if I happen to be in them, by the way, because I care and Facebook also tries to build a profile on me based on any data you have about me without asking either of us for permission. For everyone else, it's simply time to take some responsibility and police our own actions. That's easier than you might think and here are a few tips to get you started.","Know what you are giving a company and what you get in return. That means think about all the data a huge company like Google collects from you and how they handle that data then decide if it's a good deal for you. It also means to think small and decide if it's worth letting Toyota have access to your contacts so that your car can announce a caller by name while you're driving. Everything is give-and-take, and you need to make sure what they are taking is worth what they are giving.","Every piece of software on every device with a screen has terms you need to agree to before you start using it. Read them. Read every word and question anything you do not understand. Question the answers you get, too, until you're satisfied.","Decide what services you need versus what services you don't. Do you really need Alexa and Cortana and Google Assistant and Siri and Bixby and Roscoe's Rib Rack's automated drive-thru knowing everything about you? Keep the things you need (as long as you're comfortable with the terms) and ditch the things you don't.","Don't sign in to your new Android phone during the setup. Skip past and get everything running so you can see what you might want to uninstall or disable before you've logged in with your Google account. Once you've deleted and disabled the huge amounts of spyware and garbage that companies love to install on your new phone, open the Gmail app and you'll be sent to the sign-in process.","If you find apps on your phone that you can't disable or delete, find out why. The answer could be because of a legitimate need (many Android apps depend on other apps being in place to work) or it could be because that app is from a company interested in things you do and places you go and wants to send data back to the mothership. If, for example, you're not OK that some Android apps need Chrome to be installed and not disabled, make sure your next phone doesn't have Chrome installed. Or iTunes. Or OneNote. Or whatever.","Use some common sense. And it's OK to ask questions if you don't trust your own common sense, too. Nobody is a walking encyclopedia that knows the right answer to everything and you'll always be able to find someone who is an expert on the things you aren't.","The old saying goes \"if you want something done right, you do it yourself.\"","If we don't start taking some responsibility ourselves when it comes to our privacy there are no good outcomes. We don't want or need lawmakers who are older than the transistor itself trying to decide what's best for us, we don't want any one company (like Google) acting as a gateway for all of our personal information. And we don't want to keep seeing things like Facebook screwing us over (and over) until we have nothing left that it wants. We can do this. You can do this.","Jerry Hildenbrand","Jerry is Mobile Nation's resident nerd and proud of it. There's nothing he can't take apart, but many things he can't reassemble.

No additional editorial effort was invested in any aspect of the app so, in effect, the performance was entirely social.","Implementing the reading experience within Facebook was also a conscious decision to give us space to experiment away from the main Guardian website.","In the months following the launch, we saw tremendous volumes of traffic being generated by the app. Over 12 million Facebook users have authenticated the Guardian Facebook app since launch, and at its peak (April 2012) we were seeing 6 million active monthly users.","The Facebook app has given us access to a hard to reach audience and has helped us learn much more about our new and existing readership which, as a digital first organisation, is crucial.","The app has also played an integral role in helping us understand best practice for the social discovery of news, and a few months ago the app enabled us to implement social login on Guardian.co.uk, which means that users can now register on the Guardian using their Facebook details for a more social experience on the site.","In light of this, we have decided to switch our focus to creating more social participation for our users on our own core properties, beginning with guardian.co.uk.","In the future, for example, users on our site may be able to 'agree' or 'disagree' with comment pieces, take part in polls or express their view on the likelihood of a football rumour coming true. The key thing is that the user will be in control and if they're not interested in sharing it will not impact on their experience of accessing our content on guardian.co.uk.","As part of this switch in focus, from Monday 17 December we will begin directing users who click on a Guardian link within Facebook straight to our website to view articles, so over time all users will no longer be shown the content on a page within Facebook.","With more than 1 billion users, Facebook remains a hugely important platform through which a global audience is able to discover our content and we continue to work closely with them on our future plans, which they fully support: \"The Guardian has been at the forefront of innovation on the Facebook platform and many publications around the world have followed its lead, building their readership through social discovery,\" Facebook told us recently. \"Now, by integrating Facebook deep into guardian.co.uk and allowing readers to login with Facebook and share their activity with friends, the Guardian is once again demonstrating innovative ways to engage and grow audiences via the Facebook platform.\"","At the Guardian, we take the view that we need to be in a position to work with platforms as they evolve, and with users as they explore new ways of interacting with our content. The way we prefer to do this is to experiment and learn what works. This is an example of that approach and we think the next incarnation of social participation will be a useful enhancement to the Guardian site."],"isopubdate":"2012-12-13"}

Gonzales posted a Facebook Live video of the duo and the children walking into the outdoor playground of the mosque. They grabbed brochures and fliers about events, prayer announcements, classes and services and made disparaging comments about Muslims while Gonzales kept live-streaming.","“Look at this, you guys,” she added, talking to her Facebook Live viewers.","Walking over to another bulletin board, the women saw an announcement about tax assistance, which prompted Gonzales to say: “What do they work and do? They don’t even work.”","At one point, Gonzales can be heard telling one of the children to not touch the outdoor slide, suggesting it’s covered in “germs.”","“This is the infiltration of the Arabic Muslim, coming in and destroying America,” Gonzales told her Facebook Live viewers. “The Muslims are nothing but evil Satan worshipers. … Pedophilia runs deep in the Muslim community.”","At one point, Dauenhauer marveled at their haul: “We have so much literature.” To which Gonzales said, “Yep, we’re gonna expose this.”","Detective Lily Duran, spokeswoman for the Tempe Police Department, said the women were arrested Thursday and charged with burglary, a felony. She said “an enhancement of hate crime will be considered” for their sentencing.","Arizona does not charge people with hate crimes, but defendants could face an increased sentence if they committed a felony motivated by bias against a person’s race, gender, religion, disability or sexual orientation. Gonzales and Dauenhauer were transported and booked into the Tempe City Jail.","A message left at a number that appeared in public records under Gonzales’s name was not returned. She also did not respond to a Facebook message. The Washington Post was unable to find a contact number and Facebook page for Dauenhauer. The video is no longer on Gonzales’s Facebook page, but versions of it are still percolating online.","The alleged crime appears to have happened on March 4 without the knowledge of the mosque’s staff. Ahmad Al-Akoum, the mosque’s imam, said he didn’t know it had occurred until a few days later, after the Southern Poverty Law Center contacted the mosque about the video. The mosque alerted Tempe police, andauthorities later subpoenaed Facebook to obtain the Facebook Live video, Al-Akoum said.","“It’s really disheartening and disturbing to see people this time and age as ignorant as those people are in terms of their knowledge of Islam and Muslims,” Al-Akoum said. “What’s most devastating for me was to see them tagging along those young, innocent children and giving them lessons on hate and teaching them how to be intolerant.”","Referring to the video, Al-Akoum said the women bragged about what they were doing at the mosque and invited people to show up at some of the activities announced in the fliers. He said he had to make calls to warn people that protesters might show up at their events.","Al-Akoum said Gonzales’s comments were filled with misconceptions about sharia law. He noted a part of the video in which the women can be seen walking toward a nearby restaurant that sells halal meat, which Gonzales seemed to associate with sharia law.","“Halal, it means clean. It means it’s really good for you,” Al-Akoum said. “But for her, that was sharia law.”","Sharia law is a set of rules that govern aspects of the daily lives of Muslims. Soner Cagaptay, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute of Near East Policy, wrote: “In the West, sharia law is often associated with corporal punishment, such as beheadings carried out by Islamist extremists and the likes of the Islamic State. But in fact, only a few countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, enact sharia in this form.”","In a 2016 column outlining myths about sharia, Asifa Quraishi-Landes, a University of Wisconsin law professor, wrote that sharia is not necessarily a law in the sense that the West sees it.","“Sharia is not a book of statutes or judicial precedent imposed by a government, and it’s not a set of regulations adjudicated in court,” she wrote. “Rather, it is a body of Koran-based guidance that points Muslims toward living an Islamic life.”","Sharia is also not about conquest or forcing Islam on non-Muslims, Quraishi-Landes said. Scholars on fiqh, or the human interpretation of sharia, “always insisted that Muslims in non-Muslim lands must obey the laws of those lands and do no harm within host countries,” she wrote.","The incident follows a year when the number of hate groups across the country climbed. The Southern Poverty Law Center tallied 954 active hate groups nationwide in 2017, a 4 percent increase from 2016. The center said most of the growth was concentrated in neo-Nazi, anti-Muslim and black nationalist groups.","Pictures and videos on Gonzales’s Facebook page show that she and Dauenhauer often attended anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rallies, and brought the children with them. Several pictures show Gonzales with signs that say, “SHARIAH LAW, HONOR KILLING,” “#NODACA,” “#NOAMNESTY” and “#DACAISCACA.” Her Facebook picture shows her wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat and an American flag with President Trump’s face on it.","One video shows Gonzales and others at a Bernie Sanders rally in Phoenix on Sunday, accosting people who say they support the U.S. senator from Vermont. At one point during the live stream, a Muslim woman walked by Gonzales.","“Muslims have no right in America!” she screamed at the woman, who turned out to be Deedra Abboud, a Muslim running for U.S. Senate.","Gonzales accosted Abboud. The women talked at each other. Gonzales ranted about sharia law and how Muslims hate America, at one point pointing her finger at Abboud. Seemingly unfazed, Abboud responded by saying “I love America” over and over.","Dauenhauer was a member of the Patriot Movement AZ, a “grass-roots organization” that defends “American values against the progressive Leftist and Globalist Agenda,” according to its website. The organization said it removed Dauenhauer as a member after the incident at the mosque. Gonzales, the group said, was never affiliated with Patriot Movement AZ.","In a Facebook post Wednesday, the group said the women “conducted themselves in a manner inconsistent and offensive to the ideas and beliefs” of the organization.","Correction: A initial version of this story incorrectly reported that Gonzales was a member of Patriot Movement AZ."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Tom Suozzi made the remark to constituents at a town hall last week, saying that folks opposed to Trump might resort to the “Second Amendment.”","“It’s really a matter of putting public pressure on the president,” Suozzi said in a newly released video of the March 12 talk in Huntington. “This is where the Second Amendment comes in, quite frankly, because you know, what if the president was to ignore the courts? What would you do? What would we do?”","A listener then blurts out, “What’s the Second Amendment?”","The left-leaning Democrat says, “The Second Amendment is the right to bear arms.”","The spectators laughed — some nervously. Republicans were not amused.","“This video is incredibly disturbing. It’s surreal to watch a sitting member of Congress suggest that his constituents should take up arms against the president of the United States,” said National Republican Campaign Committee spokesman Chris Martin.","Suozzi political adviser Kim Devlin denied the pol was “advocating for an armed insurrection.”","But the Suozzi campaign at the same time seemed to double down on the comments, as they forwarded a line penned by Thomas Jefferson that called for armed resistance.","“What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms,” the quote said.","Suozzi’s comment seems to conflict with his recent push for gun control following the Parkland, Florida, school shooting.","Suozzi even participated in the March 14 student walkout for gun control outside the US Capitol — and called on the young people of his district to back tightened gun laws.","“I think we should engage the high school students of #NY03, and all of Long Island, to promote gun violence prevention legislation,” he said in a Feb. 21 tweet.","Trump himself has in the past used language similar to Suozzi’s. During the 2016 campaign, he told a crowd at a rally in North Carolina that if Hillary Clinton were elected and able to nominate a Supreme Court justice, there would be nothing that gun supporters could do. He then added: “Although the Second Amendment people — maybe there is, I don’t know.”","The remark was widely seen as a veiled call for violence, though Trump denied that was his meaning.","Suozzi, a first-term congressman elected in 2016, is seeking re-election this fall. He formerly served as Nassau County executive.","He is expected to easily win the Democratic primary and face GOP challenger Dan Debono, a former US Navy SEAL, in the general election."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

{"originalurl":"https://marketoonist.com/2014/05/personaldat.html","title":"\"Marketing with Personal Data\" cartoon | Marketoonist | Tom Fishburne","text":["A Chicago family recently received a promotional mailer from OfficeMax addressed to “Mike Seay/Daughter Killed in Car Crash/Or Current Business.” The Seay family lost their daughter less than a year earlier.","Including “daughter killed in car crash” wording on the envelope was obviously a mistake, but the issue is far bigger than a typo. Having that sensitive data to begin with reveals the inner workings of data brokers and consumer targeting. This is the ugly side of Big Data. Increasing troves of personal data (including sensitive life stage events) are tracked by data brokers to fuel marketing campaigns. Recent Congressional testimony showed that data brokers even sell lists of rape victims and AIDS patients.","These may be extreme cases, but I think marketers need to clearly draw the line on how they plan to use customer data. In the pursuit of creating relevant advertising, marketers are walking a tricky tightrope on consumer privacy.","“Consumers are worried about our use of data, but they’re pissed if I don’t deliver relevance… How am I supposed to deliver relevance and magically deliver what they want if I don’t look at the data?”","There’s a legislative movement in the US to limit corporate access to personal data. However government regulation ultimately plays out, I think there’s an opportunity for marketers to take the high road.","As Julie Bernard puts it, “I could just track every phone that came into Macy’s without announcing to people. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.”","Get a new marketoon each week:","11 Comments","It’s so useful to get served relevant content when it helps us as consumers.","But there also has to be trust. Think amazon.com for example. The site does a very nice job serving us data (products) that are relevant. I trust them. Mostly because I have not heard a reason why I shouldn’t and because Amazon serves me relevant products.","Great post, Tom! The first two things that came to my mind whilst reading were, in fact, two apps. “Whisper” and “Over the Shoulder”. The former: a place to share uncensored comments about everything in your life (including brands, of course); The latter: (I quote) “a tool that provides unprecidented access into consumers everyday lives”. Meaning once installed it will track your journeys during a day and prompt you for feedback (and feelings). While sign-up + consent is required, I imagine it will not take long until major social media sites will integrate this as an embedded feature, making rating (or feedback giving) as well as personal data disclosure mandatory for free service. So another ugly side to Big Data… And it will only get more rude.","There is much talk of the ‘creepy line’ in marketing, and Google’s Eric Schmidt famously said it was Google policy to get right up to it.","The problem is that where Eric draws the creepy line is very different to where I would for myself.","There is nothing inherently wrong with the practice of consumer targeting of course, the problem in my mind is that it is mostly hidden, and as the example illustrates, the methods can sometimes be highly questionable.","To me the answer of balancing personalisation with privacy is permission. Marketers would do well to be more transparent about what they do, get permission from consumers to do it, and then make sure they get it right – deliver personalisation that does benefit consumers.","This is especially needed online – where every click can be used to build a profile.","There is much talk about consumer ‘engagement’ in marketing circles – but until that engagement starts with permission, it looks to most people a lot like what it is – a euphemism for ‘tracking you as much as possible’.","The question that needs to be asked here is “what EXACTLY am I using this data for?”","As I read the excerpt, I struggle to understand how this family’s tragedy had any relevance to OfficeMax! I’m also confident that the mailer itself did not have any unique content tailored to this family’s particular circumstance.","From my perception, most of this data is simply being used for micro-targeting which is highly inefficient for most businesses.","If your strategy dictates targeting at this level, and you decide to go down the road of purchasing data at this level, then the content and the product should have true relevance to the consumer that you are targeting.","Otherwise, it is at best, an inefficient spend and at worst, a breech of the consumer’s trust and an invasion of their privacy.","I think the biggest problem is that they are using the data with no safeguards as to what’s being put out there.","The architectural firm I worked for years ago did a big data project once a year. We would order a list of schools that met the criteria for our firm and then we would go through all the entries, making sure the addresses were correct (at least 10% were usually out of date), making sure the people’s names were spelled correctly (thank you, school district websites!), and generally making sure there was nothing idiotic on them (i.e. women’s names with a Mr., men’s names with a Ms., etc.).","Every time I see one of these mistakes happen like with Mr. Seay’s daughter, I wonder, do people even stop to check these big mailing lists now? Or do they just let them go, assuming the big data companies will do it for them? There’s not a system of checks and balances built into the system to make sure that the data is accurate, appropriate, and ready to go. One hand assumes the other hand is covering the leak in the boat, so to speak.","We as marketers should not have this type of inaccuracy leading to inefficiency, and, as in this case, offensiveness to our potential customers.","I was fascinated by the Target example Charles Duhigg outlined in his book The Power of Habit. Target’s pregnancy prediction score was effective at identifying pregnant women and triggering coupon mailers – which were sent to a teenage girl. Her father was furious until he had a talk with his daughter and found out, “there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of.”","Target statistician Andrew Pole commented, “We are very conservative about compliance with all privacy laws. But even if you’re following the law, you can do things where people get queasy.”","The new policy mixes coupons for expecting parents randomly with non-baby items. Target found “. . . as long as a pregnant woman thinks she hasn’t been spied on, she’ll use the coupons. She just assumes that everyone else on her block got the same mailer for diapers and cribs. As long as we don’t spook her, it works.”","So, the solution for Target was to avoid being obvious, but not fully transparent / permission based.","The book suggests that Target’s revenue growth went from $44 billion in 2002, when Pole was hired, to $67 billion in 2010 was in part attributable to Pole’s work capturing the expecting parent market.","Why should data, like spam and telemarketing, not be an opt-in? Consumers “pissed that you don’t deliver relevance” without having established some direct relationship and data-trust are probably pissed that you are delivering anything unsolicited at all. Blaming data is not a laudable excuse for being a nuisance."],"isopubdate":"2014-05-11"}
{"originalurl":"https://krypt3ia.wordpress.com/2018/03/25/cambridge-analytica-and-psychographics-versus-facebook-algorithms-and-targeting/","title":"Cambridge Analytica And Psychographics Versus Facebook Algorithms and Targeting | Krypt3ia","text":["Last week I came across some tasty data out on the net concerning the clients that Cambridge Analytica had been serving in the last election cycle other than Trump. Within that data dump I also came across some python scripts for harvesting data on Twitter as well from a developer at CA which ties them also to mining and using potentially, Twitter as well as Facebook to create pscyhographic profiles and to target those people out there who had the same sentiments and desires around electing Trump as president. What I found in looking at the data and doing some research has brought me to the notion that Analytica’s part in this whole thing was just one sliver of a larger whole. That together with the Russian active measures campaigns, disinformation, propaganda, and echo chamber incitement thereof, Analytica helped target some of the people that Russia needed to target as well as the Trump campaign itself.","In fact, after really digging in here, it has become clear to me that Facebook may have a larger part of the problem with their algorithms that commoditize their user base and allowed for weaponizing of that data to be used in the propaganda campaigns by the Trump campaign and the GRU’s operations. Cambridge Analytica is not the big bad here in essence but a part of a larger whole that the news media seems to be unable to grok because it is not as sexy as having a new Bond style villain to get clicks on. No, the larger and more subtle story here is that the people were manipulated by the Mercer’s, the Bannon’s and the GRU using the tools given to them by Facebook and Facebook as well as the media, to synergize the propaganda with the help of all that information the people have chosen (wittingly or otherwise) to give up by using these platforms.","While the truth keeps coming out in drips and drabs on Cambridge Analytica, one has to also take note of the Channel 4 undercover video’s as well where CA’s Alexander Nix offers up age old kompromat style operations to their would be client. This all likely is second nature to the SCL group, the company that is tied to the MOD and DOD as offering tools for propaganda and manipulation in the past and of which CA is a spin-off company. Once you understand this, then you can see how Nix might just be offering things off of the menu from SCL and happily so to make a sale here.","What Nix is offering though might in fact be the modus operandi for the “whole package” in the case of political manipulation. Think about it, you target the people you want to vote, you then set up the opponent with kompromat and then you leak that judiciously. It would destroy the candidate and prop up their opponent pretty well don’t you think? Overall, what you have to realize here is that Cambridge Analytica was selling itself not just as an analytics company with a side of advertising for political campaigns, but instead a one stop shop in black propaganda and dirty tricks using analytics and psychology to target the voter. Of course now you have to ask yourselves just how effective CA’s pscyhographics and operations really were, how they may have learned from past experience, and what may have been their pivot from just analytics and psychology to propaganda and dirty tricks to pay the bills. First though, let’s look at the data I found and run through some of the premises that CA puts forth to see where fact meets Phrenology.","The Data:","I was Google dorking around the other day and came across someone’s git repo that had an Excel sheet in it concerning Cambridge Analytica’s clients in 2016. When I opened this up I was amazed to see just who else was using CA’s psychometrics for their campaigns other than Trump. What I saw was that Ben Carson, John Bolton, Ted Cruz, and a host of other orgs had been using CA’s offerings as far back as 2014, in the case of Bolton’s super PAC. Carson and Cruz both had limited dalliances with CA but Trump spent considerably on Analytica in 2016. In fact you can see from the sheet, the campaign slogans or catch phrases that they tried too, using them as code names for projects.","All of this data was obtained through the fec.gov website where they have to give up the information as part of the law. So no secrets here really but interesting information to be gleaned on who was using CA’s services and just how long this has been going on. In the case of John Bolton, you can see that he was attempting to use CA to further the candidacy of someone he was supporting back in 2014. In total, the sum for all this work shown here is over four million dollars between all the campaigns and entities.","Notice though, no charges for Ukrainian hookers and blow for kompromat though. *snerk*","Of note as well are the ancillary campaign strategies or slogans that they had for Trump before they came up with the MAGA (Make America Great Again) claptrap, a slogan though that for those of a certain mind, worked wonders for Trump and his particular brand of populism no? You had “Make America Number 1” which is just not as catchy as “Make America GREAT Again” which they refined from the number one phrase. Of course the whole mode here is to say that America is no longer ‘great’ and it can only be made ‘great’ again by Trump. This is a clever little psychological trick in that it pastes everyone else as part of the pool of people that made America lose it’s greatness and is a phrase that those of a mind, can latch onto as a dog whistle.","While I was dorking, I also located a bunch of FARA statements that SCL-Social filled out and gee, who was funneling money to CA to work as a foreign agent? Why Dubai and the UAE of course! You can see the FARA statements made by Andreae and Associates (a political intelligence and risk group in the US) that is working for SCL-Social, a sub division of SCL-Group, and parent to Cambridge Analytica. What a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive… Or at last manipulate.","As a side note, if you look at the original filings on the FEC site you can see more information on the who and the what and the how. In one case I have looked at so far, the LLC that was created to spend the money on “Make America Number 1” is called “GLITTERING STEEL” which to me sounds like one of those derpy names given to APT actors or bad spy novels. Well, once you Google that name though you can see even more about this, that it was a Bannon run entity and that there is at least one law suit pending over their illegal actions in California.","This shit is deep folks… Like “deep state” deep. Anyway, I will continue Googling but you can too! Let me know if you find good stuff out there that maybe I can further write about.","Python Scripts:","While I was Googling up that spreadsheet, I also came across some .py scripts that were on a github for a Michael Phillips, who works for Cambridge Analytica. His creations were for harvesting data from Twitter and pulled geolocation data in one and sentiments in the other. In his geolocation script he was looking to pull addresses with accurate lat and long too! Now, you and I know that Twitter allows this kind of thing and others like me have used different tools to pull OSINT on characters like da’eshbags and the like over the years. It is of note though, that Twitter has to my knowledge, not been mentioned that much with regard to targeting and psychometrics mining by CA in the press. So, this is interesting and makes me wonder if perhaps CA has had more inside access to other features of Twitter as well?","Twitter is notoriously not that helpful to the government and others so I have to wonder if access was given was it bought? What kind of data would Twitter have sold? What do we really know here? Do we know anything about this? Anyone have any insight here for me? I for one would like to know if Twitter was working with CA and to what extent if any they where. This becomes really important just like access to Facebook data because Twitter was the second tool du jour that the GRU used to sow all the chaos and push the propaganda in the 2016 election cycle as well as in other areas such as Brexit and other attacks on Ukraine and the like.","But I digress… Let’s look at the real value of Cambridge Analytica’s potential versus the tools afforded by the likes of Twitter and Facebook themselves.","Psychographics Versus Custom Audiences and Lookalike Audiences:","A lot of the news cycle has been taken up with Analytica of late but what are they offering and just how effective could psyhcometric profiles be of users on Facebook? CA claims to have the ability to target people by the OCEAN profiling system of analytics. This is how they managed to make an application that then stole others data in the form of a personality test that they leveraged on Facebook. While this testing can lead to some valuable information, it is not as accurate or the right tool in my book to micro target a voter as opposed to someone buying something that they like or want. While this was the bread and butter of CA’s claims the reality is that this tool is not enough to hone in on people that well to be a real factor in electing Donald Trump and you all have to realize this.","What’s more, if you look at the toolbox of Facebook alone, they have some algorithms and applications alone that could have been a major factor in Trumps win. The primary two tools are ‘Custom Audiences‘ and ‘Lookalike Audiences‘ which Facebook uses to target people for advertising and the like. Both of these tools take outside data, in the case of this last election cycle that data would be voter rolls. Uploading those rolls (which you can access) you then are targeting your audience to push feeds to. In the case of Trump, then you are using the Republican rolls and targeting en mas your message to them. Now, consider this, those same rolls were used by the GRU to push content to those feeds as well. That’s right, ad buys by the GRU, remember all the talk about that in the news?","Ok so where does that leave us? Well, with CA and Facebook, you could be targeting those people who are outside the rolls and magnifying your efforts with the likes and the comments by stealing the 50 million people’s data as well. This basically becomes an amplification attack kinda like a DoS if you think about it. In the scheme of things it seems CA was just another cog but when you look at it all as a whole you have to ask yourselves these questions;","1) Was CA able to target more people outside the norm?","2) Was CA then able to take ancillary data (other people’s) that also had the same “sentiments” as their core psychometric profile because they were friends of those core friendly users?","3) Was this data then given to the Russians either by insiders at CA or by the Trump campaign itself to help target users and spread the propaganda and active measures to greater effect?","These are the questions the Senate and House should be asking and I am sure that these are Questions the FBI and the Mueller probe are asking. Also, one should consider this more macro targeting than micro but meh, either way it seems that Facebook has a larger share of the blame that they certainly don’t want to take. This is especially true now that they have lost so much value on the stock market as well as losing clients like Space-X and Tesla recently in a backlash that continues.","Was, and Is Cambridge Analytica an Arm of SCL’s Propaganda and Psyops Operations?:","This leaves us at the point where Alexander Nix and his compatriot are seen on hidden video offering kompromat style operations as well as targeted psychographics. If you start looking into SCL, it’s mother org, you can see that they have a history of this kind of black propaganda offerings for the military and governments of the world. It would not be a stretch to see CA using SCL to do some dirty work if not doing it in house so to speak. So when Nix was caught on camera and later made some excuses that he was just “going with what the client wanted” I feel that this is closer to what he wanted to offer because it made money as opposed to the straight analytics package CA offers. Perhaps even more so, Nix knew that analytics was just not enough and that psychographics should really only be used in micro targeted ads for shoes.","If the targeting works, and psychometrics/psychographics do up to a point, then they can be a part of a larger package of tools to target a macro audience with micro tools. I think we have seen, and I have pointed out above that this is likely to work better as a larger package of many tools and operations to influence an audience but it is not the make all be all. I think they discovered that and went back to the old ways to make money with SCL’s cache and tools that have been in use for many years with great effect. Where the rubber meets the road in the 2016 election is that the Russians then possibly leveraged SCL and CA with or without their knowledge to even greater effect and that is what led us to where we are today.","How that actually happened is something for the investigators at the special counsel to tell us later on.","SCL’s Domains:","While I am on the subject of SCL and looking at future possibilities, I looked up everything that SCL owns domain wise. There are many domains that they own and we should keep an eye out for them in future being spun up. In fact, I kind of wonder if they have other domains hidden under other LLC’s etc that we have not seen that may have been part and party to some of the 2016 psyops and propaganda operations on behalf of the Trump campaign. Looking at these domains they have many plans and we should all be paying attention.","Conclusions:","So here are my conclusions looking at all of this stuff. First off, CA is not the big bad here but Facebook and maybe Twitter are. Ask yourselves and ask them just how much data they sold or gave access to other entities in the 2016 election cycle. Who were they? Were they connected to CA? SCL? GRU? Also be asking yourselves just how much do you want Facebook to have of your privacy? In posts recently I have seen people saying that phone calls and other private data were in the data dumps they downloaded. How did that data all get into their hands? Well, you let it happen! If you have Facebook on your phone, well, then they have everything and unless you read the fine print, you are boned.","Secondly, I for one believe that Facebook and Twitter and other social media entities sold data to GRU cutouts and they should be taking more responsibility henceforth. I know that Facebook has made efforts to control ad buys and such but really, they hold the keys and unless they vet every application and client, well, it could happen easily again. Zuck needs to grow up and stop the fuckery. His platform is now a weapon and our privacy is the ammunition. I also think that everyone should consider leaving the platform because they hold too much of your data that can be abused. Until such a time as they take this seriously I would not invest the time on them.","Thirdly, I have to wonder just how much information was being passed between CA and Trump/Bannon/etc that made it to the GRU. There are more than a few Russians in the CA constellation that could have been leveraged by the Russians but until some thorough investigation is done it is hard to tell what happened here and at what scale. I do find it interesting though that at least the Facebook data and tools were leveraged and wonder how much was direct buy from GRU cutouts as opposed to passed on perhaps by assets within the Trump campaign itself.","Time will tell but in the meantime here is some data for you all to Mueller.","3 Responses","I really enjoy your writing/research, getting it my inbox and sharing it often so am quite puzzled why you have me blocked on Twitter. I’m not asking that you unblock me because that’s your decision, just wondering why.","As far as I can tell, the difference between Twitter and Facebook is that Twitter allows anyone to access individual tweet metadata while Facebook does not. This includes geolocation data and the like.","What you ~have~ to pay for on Twitter is 1) access to their firehose (and firehose-like products: the free tier of non-filtered data collection limits to something like 1 percent of public tweets) and 2) their own analytics products (and, of course, advertising).","At the end of the day, the public perception issue with Facebook was lax controls: I don’t think anyone would’ve batted an eye if CA had simply bought the data."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

By early summer, the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app. The researcher scraped private data from over 50 million Facebook users — and Cambridge Analytica went into business selling so-called psychometric profiles of American voters, setting itself on a collision course with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain.","Image","Mr. Thiel at Trump Tower in Manhattan. He serves on the board at Facebook.CreditEduardo Munoz/Reuters","The revelations pulled Palantir — co-founded by the wealthy libertarian Peter Thiel — into the furor surrounding Cambridge, which improperly obtained Facebook data to build analytical tools it deployed on behalf of Donald J. Trump and other Republican candidates in 2016. Mr. Thiel, a supporter of President Trump, serves on the board at Facebook.","“There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data,” said Christopher Wylie, a data expert and Cambridge Analytica co-founder, in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday.","Cambridge Analytica has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports about the firm’s data harvesting were published this month in The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian.","Image","“There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data,” said Christopher Wylie, a Cambridge Analytica co-founder, in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday.CreditParliamentary Recording Unit, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images","The connections between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica were thrust into the spotlight by Mr. Wylie’s testimony on Tuesday. Both companies are linked to tech-driven billionaires who backed Mr. Trump’s campaign: Cambridge is chiefly owned by Robert Mercer, the computer scientist and hedge fund magnate, while Palantir was co-founded in 2003 by Mr. Thiel, who was an initial investor in Facebook.","The Palantir employee, Alfredas Chmieliauskas, works on business development for the company, according to his LinkedIn page. In an initial statement, Palantir said it had “never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica, nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.” Later on Tuesday, Palantir revised its account, saying that Mr. Chmieliauskas was not acting on the company’s behalf when he advised Mr. Wylie on the Facebook data.","“We learned today that an employee, in 2013-2014, engaged in an entirely personal capacity with people associated with Cambridge Analytica,” the company said. “We are looking into this and will take the appropriate action.”","The company said it was continuing to investigate but knew of no other employees who took part in the effort. Mr. Wylie told lawmakers that multiple Palantir employees played a role.","Documents and interviews indicate that starting in 2013, Mr. Chmieliauskas began corresponding with Mr. Wylie and a colleague from his Gmail account. At the time, Mr. Wylie and the colleague worked for the British defense and intelligence contractor SCL Group, which formed Cambridge Analytica with Mr. Mercer the next year. The three shared Google documents to brainstorm ideas about using big data to create sophisticated behavioral profiles, a product code-named “Big Daddy.”","A former intern at SCL — Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of Eric Schmidt, then Google’s executive chairman — urged the company to link up with Palantir, according to Mr. Wylie’s testimony and a June 2013 email viewed by The Times.","“Ever come across Palantir. Amusingly Eric Schmidt’s daughter was an intern with us and is trying to push us towards them?” one SCL employee wrote to a colleague in the email.","Ms. Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica.","In early 2013, Alexander Nix, an SCL director who became chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and a Palantir executive discussed working together on election campaigns.","A Palantir spokeswoman acknowledged that the companies had briefly considered working together but said that Palantir declined a partnership, in part because executives there wanted to steer clear of election work. Emails reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Nix and Mr. Chmieliauskas sought to revive talks about a formal partnership through early 2014, but Palantir executives again declined.","In his testimony, Mr. Wylie acknowledged that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica never signed a contract or entered into a formal business relationship. But he said some Palantir employees helped engineer Cambridge’s psychographic models.","“There were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Mr. Wylie told lawmakers. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.” He did not provide an exact number for the employees or identify them.","Palantir employees were impressed with Cambridge’s backing from Mr. Mercer, one of the world’s richest men, according to messages viewed by The Times. And Cambridge Analytica viewed Palantir’s Silicon Valley ties as a valuable resource for launching and expanding its own business.","In an interview this month with The Times, Mr. Wylie said that Palantir employees were eager to learn more about using Facebook data and psychographics. Those discussions continued through spring 2014, according to Mr. Wylie.","Mr. Wylie said that he and Mr. Nix visited Palantir’s London office on Soho Square. One side was set up like a high-security office, Mr. Wylie said, with separate rooms that could be entered only with particular codes. The other side, he said, was like a tech start-up — “weird inspirational quotes and stuff on the wall and free beer, and there’s a Ping-Pong table.”","Mr. Chmieliauskas continued to communicate with Mr. Wylie’s team in 2014, as the Cambridge employees were locked in protracted negotiations with a researcher at Cambridge University, Michal Kosinski, to obtain Facebook data through an app Mr. Kosinski had built. The data was crucial to efficiently scale up Cambridge’s psychometrics products so they could be used in elections and for corporate clients.","“I had left field idea,” Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote in May 2014. “What about replicating the work of the cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to facebook?” Reproducing the app, Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote, “could be a valuable leverage negotiating with the guy.”","Those negotiations failed. But Mr. Wylie struck gold with another Cambridge researcher, the Russian-American psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built his own personality quiz app for Facebook. Over subsequent months, Dr. Kogan’s work helped Cambridge develop psychological profiles of millions of American voters.","Carole Cadwalladr contributed reporting.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Spy Contractor’s Idea Helped A Firm Harvest Facebook Data.

As a New Zealand-based developer discovered, the social media giant collected massive amounts of phone data on some of its users, including call logs with phone numbers and contact info, and metadata like time and location for SMS messages sent and received. As Ars Technica subsequently discovered, the troubling data collection practice extended—for years—to just about any Android user, as long as they gave Facebook access to their contacts at some point.","According to Ars Technica, the data-sharing was the result of a lax feature in Android's API (application program interface) that granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. Because of a loophole, Facebook was able to keep scraping that data without explicitly asking for permission even once an updated Android API that fixed the issue was released in 2012. It seems this was only an issue with Android's API, and iPhone users were unaffected by the issue.","To see what kind of data Facebook has on you, whether you're an Android user or not, you can download your full Facebook archive by going into your settings and clicking on the link at the bottom of the \"General\" tab. One you download the ZIP file, open the file named index.htm and navigate to \"contact info\" in the sidebar. In the future, don't say yes if Facebook asks for permission to access your contacts.","In a blog post on March 25, Facebook denied that it inappropriately scraped call and text data from users' phones, saying that those logs were part of an opt-in feature that Android users had to explicitly agree to. According to Ars Technica, this contradicted the experiences of several Android users whom reporter Sean Gallagher spoke to.","Facebook's privacy practices have been under intense scrutiny lately, for good reason. The company recently took out full-page ads in several major newspapers apologizing for the ongoing Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook's data-sharing rules allowed the political consulting firm to inappropriately gather data on tens of millions of users. The company is now being investigated by the FTC, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also been invited to testify before Congress about the site's privacy practices.","In general, if you don't want Facebook to share data on your every online move with third parties, you'd be wise to limit the amount of information you give it in the first place. Refrain from telling it things like where you went to school, where you work, what your birthday is, and who your siblings are. Remove your phone number or use a Google Voice number in place of your cell phone number, and again, certainly don't let the service comb through your contact list. If you like to get creative, this is one situation where it's perfectly ethical to lie. (Avoiding sharing real data with the company can also double as a good way to foil hackers combing the site for information on you.)","After you download your Facebook archive, it would also be worth it to check out which advertisers have your data from the site. You can turn off targeted advertising by going to your ad settings and unchecking all of the different interests Facebook labels you as having, disassociating yourself from that time you \"liked\" the Dr. Pepper fan page or clicked on an ad for a cute t-shirt you saw on the site. And for more about how to limit the information about you that Facebook gives to third-party apps, read on here."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The apparent misuse of Facebook data—and the social media giant's failure to police it—leave both companies with plenty still to answer for.","Facebook has suspended both Cambridge and SCL while it investigates whether both companies retained Facebook user data that had been provided by third-party researcher Aleksandr Kogan of the company Global Science Research, a violation of Facebook's terms. The suspensions were announced just hours before The New York Times and The Guardian published stories Saturday morning describing how Cambridge Analytica harvested data on 50 million US Facebook users, a number far larger than the 270,000 accounts Facebook initially cited. Facebook says it knew about the breach, but had received legally binding guarantees from the company that all of the data was deleted.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made,\" Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and general counsel, wrote in a blog post Friday night. Facebook is also suspending Kogan, as well as Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, the whistleblower who led to stories in The Guardian and The New York Times.","In a statement, a spokesperson for SCL denied the claims. \"Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data,\" the statement read. (Cambridge is an independent company in the United States that was spun out of SCL.)","According to one source, a trove of Facebook users' personal data was visible on Cambridge's internal databases in 2017.","And yet, following Facebook's announcement Friday night, sources close to Cambridge confirmed to WIRED that this data was still accessible as recently as last year. According to one source, a trove of Facebook users' personal data was visible on Cambridge's internal databases in 2017, despite SCL's current denial and past promises to both Cambridge employees and Facebook that it had all been deleted in 2015. The data included Facebook IDs, and responses to personality surveys that had been administered by Kogan in 2015. Another source close to the company recalled seeing a database called \"Kogan-import\" in Cambridge's system, which was only visible to a small number of staffers in data science, engineering, and IT. The source says the database was tightly controlled in terms of who could edit or delete it.","Asked to confirm whether this database existed, an SCL spokesperson said, \"We did a system wide internal audit to verify that all GSR data had been removed before we signed an undertaking to Facebook.\"","The data in question was gathered using an app called thisisyourdigitallife, created by Kogan, that offered Facebook users personality quizzes. Those who downloaded the app voluntarily turned over reams of personal data about what they like, where they live, and in some cases, depending on individual privacy settings, who their friends were.","Though Facebook says just 270,000 people downloaded the app, a loophole at the time apparently allowed Kogan to collect vastly more information. Until 2014, apps could also collect information on every users' entire friend network. Facebook shut down that capability for app developers in mid-2014, but offered some apps that were already up and running a small grace period before cutting them off. That timing roughly lines up with Kogan's research. Of the 50 million accounts Kogan had data on, the New York Times and Guardian reports say, 30 million had complete enough profiles that Cambridge could create psychographic profiles of them. Different than demographic profiles, these describe people based on their personality types.","Kogan passed the survey results on to SCL and Cambridge. Facebook learned about this violation in 2015, removed the app, and requested that Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information. In a statement, an SCL spokesperson said the company deleted the data as soon as they found out it violated Facebook's policies.","Cambridge Analytica has spent years denying this exact sort of association with Kogan. In a 2016 WIRED interview, I asked Nix about a 2015 report in the Guardian, which described how Cambridge Analytica had amassed data from Kogan's app. Nix called the article \"unfounded,\" and said, \"We do not hold any data from third parties, whether it’s the person you mentioned or anybody else, and we certainly do not hold any data from third parties that hasn’t been properly licensed or purchased through channels.\"1","That doesn't square with what SCL's own statement on Friday, which maintained that the company commissioned Kogan for a \"large scale research project in the US\" in 2014, and only deleted the data after it realized it had been obtained against Facebook's terms and conditions.","Under this suspension, none of the involved companies will be permitted to buy ads or manage their clients' Facebook accounts. The Trump campaign hasn't worked with Cambridge since the 2016 election, according to a source close to the campaign.","For Cambridge Analytica, this represents the nadir of what has been a steady downward spiral since election night 2016. Earlier Friday, David Carroll, a professor at the New School, filed a legal claim against SCL Group under British data protection law, seeking disclosures for how his data was used in the 2016 election and whether that US voter data was processed illegally overseas. The legal proceedings come in the midst of an ongoing investigation by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office into Cambridge Analytica's role in the Leave.EU campaign, which advocated for the United Kingdom to break with the European Union in the 2016 Brexit vote. Cambridge officials had spoken publicly about working for Leave.EU, but CEO Alexander Nix has since denied it in testimony before Parliament.","On Saturday, the ICO issued a statement saying it continues to investigate how Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used. \"We are continuing to invoke all of our powers and are pursuing a number of live lines of inquiry. Any criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously,\" the statement said.","'Facebook never comes forward with information until their backs are against the wall.'","Jonathan Albright, Columbia University","Nix also became a key figure in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, after news broke that he had contacted representatives for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in the run-up to the election, seeking information about hacked emails Wikileaks had received. Nix has confirmed initiating this contact. This apparently prompted the Trump campaign to issue a statement seemingly designed to distance the campaign from Cambridge Analytica, a firm which had already amassed doubters and critics even before the 2016 election. Long before Cambridge even began working with the Trump campaign, Republican strategists accused the company of inflating its capabilities.","Now, it appears even Cambridge is working to place rhetorical distance between Nix and the company's work in United States elections. In a statement provided to The New York Times, the company said Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election.","The chaos has led to a mass exodus from the company's nascent US political team. Nearly all of the staff that worked in the Trump campaign's San Antonio digital office are no longer at Cambridge, and sources say its political business within the United States has dwindled. Once feared by Republican digital firms as a threat to their business and by Democrats as a threat to democracy, Cambridge has steadily ceded influence since its 2016 highs.","\"The defanging of Cambridge is about just colossal fuckups over and over,\" one source close to Cambridge said.","Losing Facebook as an advertising platform, the source said, should further destabilize the already declining company. \"There’s no way this doesn't have a substantial impact on their business,\" another source familiar with Cambridge said.","The weekend's revelations don't paint Facebook in a positive light, either. After two years in which Facebook has struggled to explain how Russian propaganda and fake news proliferated on the platform, it now must explain one of its fundamental flaws: Facebook offers unprecedented data to its paying clients, but has next to no controls in place to ensure that data will be handled properly.","In a statement Saturday morning, Facebook's Grewal said, \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all—and take action against all offending parties.”","And yet, Facebook shares some of the blame. The company's executives have repeatedly been brought before Congress to testify about how the platform was used and abused during the 2016 election. The fact that the company discovered a major data breach by a vendor to the Trump campaign seems worthy of public disclosure well before three years have passed. \"Facebook never comes forward with information until their backs are against the wall,\" said Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism. \"This is a mess.\"","Facebook can, of course, punish entities that violate its policies, as it is doing with Cambridge and SCL, and it may have grounds for legal action. But the damage has already been done."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The real crown jewel was the open access it gave Cambridge Analytica to their Facebook accounts. According to Wylie, hundreds of thousands of Facebook users took personality tests with the app. In doing so, users consented to their data being collected for academic use. Its use was to prove anything but academic.","At the same time, the app also gathered the test-takers' Facebook friends' personal information. This led for over 50 million users' data being passed on to Cambridge Analytica. This is against Facebook's \"platform policy\" which banned the collection of friends' data for advertising or any reasons besides improving user experience.","Yeah. That worked out well.","This data was then used, as Nix said, to create \"individualised targeted and engagement ads\". The data was analyzed in part with the Big 5 Personality Traits psychological model, aka OCEAN V. The result, according to Nix, might target a religious voter with 30 percent religious-tinted messages, 20 percent gun rights messages, and 30 percent with economic ads, while targeting his NRA member neighbor with mostly gun rights messages on Facebook.","How successful were they? There is no question that social networking played a major factor in the 2016 election. According to Cambridge Analytica lead data scientist David Wilkinson, the company advised Trump's campaign to allocate time and resources to rural voters, especially in Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. This led to Cambridge Analytica saying afterwards, according to a resentful former senior Trump technology staffer, \"Look, I'm not saying they lied but for Cambridge Analytica to run victory laps and claim they won the election for Trump is a huge exaggeration.\"","Maybe it wasn't that much of an exaggeration.","Many, including the The New York Times, called the incident \"one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history\" and a \"breach\".","Privacy researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis sarcastically tweeted, \"Basically Facebook enabled mass phishing of accounts based on a promise developers wouldn't misuse that data. The system was working as designed, Facebook handed that data over willingly. Therefore their processes were just broken ... it wasn't a breach you see.\"","Facebook was aware that some of its users' data had been misused as early as 2015. Facebook demanded in August 2016 that both Kogan and Cambridge Analytica certify they had deleted the data. This was days before Trump hired Steve Bannon, former Cambridge Analytica vice president, to run his presidential campaign. Only now, as the news leaks, has Facebook admitted publicly that users' data has been harvested.","Cambridge Analytica has denied many of the allegations. The company now claims that when it learned the data \"had not been obtained\" in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted \"all data\" that it received. In addition, Cambridge Analytica now claims \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Sure. Whatever.","There are two morals to this story.","First, if you put any personal information on a public-facing network -- Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, whatever -- you can expect it to be gathered and used. That should be old news to most of you, but people still seemed surprised when they learn how little \"privacy\" there actually is on the net.","Second, no matter how interesting or amusing a Facebook quiz looks, if it requires you to let it access your Facebook account, don't take it. The only purpose of these quizes is to gather your information.","Finally, check to see what apps already have access to your data. Many sites use Facebook Connect logins as their logins. That's fine, but keep in mind if you turn off your Facebook account, you also lose access to these sites. But, there are other apps that you may not be using and are just vacuuming down your data. Delete these. You can do this by going to your Facebook applications setting page."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

But for me the most consequential story of late was that a self-driving car operated by Uber — with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel — struck and tragically killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz.","I could only look at that deeply unsettling story and say: Welcome to the second inning — the second inning of one of the world’s great technological leaps, the implications of which we’re just beginning to understand.","But first, let’s acknowledge one thing: The first inning was amazing.","It was an inning full of promise, discovery and marvel. In the early 2000s, a set of technologies came together into platforms, social networks and software that made connectivity and solving complex problems fast, virtually free, easy for you, ubiquitous and invisible. Suddenly, more individuals could compete, connect, collaborate and create with more other people, in more ways, from more places, for less money and with greater ease than ever before. And we sure did!","We became our own filmmakers and reporters; we launched political and social revolutions from our living rooms; we connected with long-lost family and friends; we found the answers to old and new questions with one click; we searched for everything from spouses to news to directions to kindred spirits with our phones; we exposed dictators and branded ourselves. With one touch, we could suddenly call a taxi, direct a taxi, rate a taxi and pay a taxi — or rent an igloo, rate an igloo and pay for an igloo in Alaska.","And then, just as suddenly, we found ourselves in the second inning. The cool self-driving car killed a pedestrian; the cool Facebook platform enabled Russian troll farms to divide us and inject fake news into our public life; the uncool totalitarian government learned how to use the same facial recognition tools that can ease your way through passport control to single you out in a crowd for arrest.","And Mark Zuckerberg, who promised to connect us all — and that it would all be good — found himself on the cover of Wired magazine, with his face cut, bruised and bandaged, as if he’d been hit by a fastball. He wasn’t alone. In inning two, we started to feel beat up by the same platforms and technologies that had enriched, empowered and connected our lives.","Silicon Valley, we have a problem.","What to do? For problems like this, I like to consult my teacher and friend Dov Seidman, CEO of LRN, which helps companies and leaders build ethical cultures, and the author of the book, “How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything.”","“The first inning’s prevailing ethos was that any technology that makes the world more open by connecting us or makes us more equal by empowering us individually must, in and of itself, be a force for good,” Seidman began. “But, in inning two, we are coming to grips with the reality that the power to make the world more open and equal is not in the technologies themselves. It all depends on how the tools are designed and how we choose to use them. The same amazing tech that enables people to forge deeper relationships, foster closer communities and give everyone a voice can also breed isolation, embolden racists, and empower digital bullies and nefarious actors.”","Equally important, Seidman added, these “unprecedented and valuable tools of connection” are being used with great accuracy and potency “to assault the foundations of what makes our democracies vibrant, capitalism dynamic and our societies healthy — namely, truth and trust.”","And they have begun to be used “to assault our personal foundations — our privacy and sense of identity,” Seidman said: “It is one thing to use our data to enable better shopping experiences, but when my beliefs and attitudes are mined and manipulated for someone’s political campaign, a campaign that may be antithetical to my beliefs, that is deeply harmful and unmooring.” So what to do? “Precisely because we are in just the beginning of a technological revolution with a long, uncertain, up-and-down road ahead, we need to start by pausing to reflect on how our world, reshaped by these technologies, operates differently — and on the kind of values and leadership we will need to realize their promise.”","Values are more vital now than ever, Seidman insisted. “Because sustainable values are what anchor us in a storm, and because values propel and guide us when our lives are profoundly disrupted. They help us make the hard decisions.” Hard decisions abound, because everything is now connected. “The world is fused. So there no place anymore to stand to the side and claim neutrality — to say, ‘I am just a businessperson’ or ‘I am just running a platform.’ ”","No way. “Once you see that your technologies are having unintended consequences, you cannot maintain your neutrality — especially when you’ve become so central to the lives of billions of people.”","In the fused world, Seidman said, “the business of business is no longer just business. The business of business is now society. And, therefore, how you take or don’t take responsibility for what your technology enables or for what happens on your platforms is inescapable. This is the emerging expectation of users — real people — who’ve entrusted so much of their inner lives to these powerful companies.”","To be sure, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should all be commended for trying to find engineering solutions to prevent them from being hacked and weaponized.","“But this is not just an engineering problem, or just a business model problem,” he said. “Software solutions can increase our confidence that we can stay a step ahead of the bad guys. But, fundamentally, it will take more ‘moralware’ to regain our trust. Only one kind of leadership can respond to this kind of problem — moral leadership.”","What does moral leadership look like here?","“Moral leadership means truly putting people first and making whatever sacrifices that entails,” said Seidman. “That means not always competing on shallow things and quantity — on how much time people spend on your platform — but on quality and depth. It means seeing and treating people not just as ‘users’ or ‘clicks,’ but as ‘citizens,’ who are worthy of being accurately informed to make their best choices. It means not just trying to shift people from one click to another, from one video to another, but instead trying to elevate them in ways that deepen our connections and enrich our conversations.”","It means, Seidman continued, being “fully transparent about how you operate, and make decisions that affect them — all the ways in which you’re monetizing their data. It means having the courage to publish explicit standards of quality and expectations of conduct, and fighting to maintain them however inconvenient. It means having the humility to ask for help even from your critics. It means promoting civility and decency, making the opposite unwelcome. It means being truly bold — proclaiming, for example, that you will not sleep until you’re certain that our next democratic election won’t be hacked.”","At the height of the Cold War, when the world was threatened by spreading Communism and rising walls, President John F. Kennedy vowed to “pay any price and bear any burden” to ensure the success of liberty.","Today, falling walls and spreading webs — which criminals and nations can use to poison democratic societies — are becoming the biggest threat to the success of liberty. You will know that the good guys are winning when you see big tech companies rise to Kennedy’s challenge — to pay any price and bear any burden to protect us from the downsides of the technologies they’ve created."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

For starters, Zuckerberg said Facebook will \"investigate\" all apps that have access to large amounts of data, and restrict developers' data access even further.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg","James Martin/CNET","\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a post on his Facebook page. \"I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"","The statement is Zuckerberg's first public comment since the controversy began to unfold late last Friday. Facebook disclosed that information from millions of accounts on the social network was used without people's permission by Cambridge Analytica, a digital consultancy hired by the Trump presidential campaign.","More on the data mess","According to Facebook, the data was originally collected by a Cambridge lecturer named Aleksandr Kogan for a personality quiz app. He collected the data legitimately, but then violated Facebook's terms by passing the information to Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook found out about the infraction in 2015 but didn't inform the public. Instead, the company demanded that all the parties involved destroy the information. But now there are reports that not all the data was deleted. Zuckerberg said Wednesday that Kogan's app was installed by 300,000 people. That gave Kogan access to their friends' data, too, affecting tens of millions of users. According to The New York Times, that number could be as high as 50 million.","\"This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.\"","Facebook has come under fire from lawmakers calling for Zuckerberg to answer for Facebook's actions. Prominent senators, including Democrats Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner, have called for the CEO to testify before Congress. The US Federal Trade Commission is reportedly launching a probe into Facebook. The European Union has also launched an investigation.","But as criticism continued to mount, Zuckerberg and Sandberg remained quiet. The lack of response from Facebook's leadership only intensified the backlash.","As the days piled up without a response from Zuckerberg, the hashtag #WheresZuck began to circulate on Twitter. At an internal question and answer session at Facebook headquarters on Tuesday, Zuckerberg and Sandberg were reportedly absent as the company addressed its employees about the controversy for the first time. Instead, the session was led by Facebook attorney Paul Grewal.","On Wednesday, Zuckerberg outlined specific changes Facebook would make to the platform. For Facebook users, if you haven't used an app in three months, Facebook will automatically remove access to your data. When you sign in to apps, you'll also give developers less of your personal information -- only your name, email and Facebook profile photo. The company will also start presenting users with a tool at the top of their news feeds that shows them what apps they've been using so they can more easily manage their data settings.","In addition, Facebook will audit any app it suspects of suspicious behavior. If developers don't agree to the audit, they'll be banned from the platform. Developers will also have to sign a contract in order to ask people for access to their data.","Sue Desmond-Hellman, Facebook's lead director, said in a statement that Zuckerberg and Sandberg \"know how serious this situation is,\" and are working with the rest of Facebook's leadership to build stronger user protections. \"They have built the company and our business and are instrumental to its future.\"","\"I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward.\"","Zuckerberg will be interviewed on CNN on Wednesday night at 6 p.m. PT to discuss the controversy further.","Here's the complete text of Zuckerberg's post:","I want to share an update on the Cambridge Analytica situation -- including the steps we've already taken and our next..."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly “legitimate way and through proper channels” when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie.","Kogan’s app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Advertisement - story continues below","It seems that Facebook allowed Kogan’s app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as “likes,” because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators. Kogan was reportedly able to create more than 50 million profiles using the trend and characteristics data before providing them to Cambridge.","“Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” Wylie said of Cambridge, according to The New York Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Do you think this company helped Trump win the election as Facebook claims?","YesNo","Completing this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge.

What is more clear is that Facebook’s features can help sow seeds of further discord by allowing operators to capitalize on polarization.","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology, said in a statement. “While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways.”","Advertisement - story continues below","Severalreports, including The New York Times’ one, are referring to the actions of Cambridge Analytica — which had social media prowess described as the “secret sauce” to Trump’s political campaign — as a data “breach.”","But as noted by Grewal in an update made Saturday morning, “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false” because Kogan requested and gained access through permissible, in fact, standard, means. “Everyone involved gave their consent,” said Grewal.","Facebook says it is subjecting all apps that seek personal user information to its App Review process, “which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.”","Founded by Tucker Carlson, a 25-year veteran of print and broadcast media, and Neil Patel, former chief policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, The Daily Caller News Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit providing original investigative reporting from a team of professional reporters that operates for the public benefit."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

It will cause Mark Zuckerberg to even further control our perspective on the world.","2. But shouldn't we be worried about that? We're not happy with the current influence of Facebook on our life, and it might get even worse in the future.","3. We're dependent on a black-box that's deciding what we get to see on our new feed and what not.","4. Some configuration options exists,","5. but these are too digital. Switching off is not really an option. Nor is quitting Facebook. We don't want to miss all of the features they offer.","6. We need more ways to configure Facebook to suit our needs and wishes. It's time to consider a split-up of Facebook","7. If we want to understand why things appear on our news feeds, we need to know what's stored about us. We want to be aware of our own meta-data too. By monitoring where our own content and data ends up, we can choose if and how we allow any profiling to happen. Perhaps we only decide to keep Facebook for its front-end interface.","8. If we're free to choose components, we can choose to avoid the untraceable Facebook algorithms, demand openness or pick a provider of a Machine Learning service that we trust.","9. If it's such an influential instrument in our life, it makes sense to know exactly which rules are active.","10. But as with human life, there are always exceptions to any rufle. If we're able to finetune the rules with our own personalized exceptions, the rule base can become really meaningful.","11. The need for transparency and freedom to choice is getting more relevant and urgent, because companies like Facebook are going to play a more prominent role in our life","12. We've gotten used to the smartphone as our personal assistent, guiding us towards appointments, even responsible for arranging some of our activities.","13. But with AR devices this guidance will continue during our activities too.","14. The classic example is dating, which will become highly efficient and effective if we're being mentored througout a date based on real-time analysis of data coming from connected wearables such as our heartrate sensors or fitness watches.","15. With bulky uncomfortable devices that seems highly unprobable, but some new AR devices have a regular size and look.","16. The big tech companies can't wait for this future of the connected human. They are getting ready and filing numerous patents.","17. There will be a lot of new bussiness opportunities for them, being able to guide the behaviour of people.","18. With the help of an AR device, we can do everything ourselves. But what kind of DIY world is that going to be?","19. Looking at this in a schematic view, it's clear that something is not right. Tech companies using us and our data enabling them to control us.","20. It's time for an approach with humans at the centre, and an API to help us to be the one making decisions - and having options to choose from! With a growing ecosystem of life enhancing apps, services and components, we can choose how we want to be guided through the day.","21. You want to configure yourself. As a hands-on way to explore what that could mean, I've launched IFTHISTHENI.COM","22. With just a few basic rules, this system will not be comparable to the advanced algorithms of the big influential social media companies, but it's a start. Instead of awaiting what will happen to us, it's better to get started with the creation of alternatives.","23. We've already gotten accustomed to devices and software monitoring us and telling us how we're doing, this system is no different. Not feeling happy? By knowing what makes you happy, you're able to change it by reconfiguring yourself.","24. So a next time you see a group like this on the street, they might not be hunting Pokemons but they might be configuring themselves.","25. Or perhaps they are sharing their rules with each other, collaboratively working on a rule-base for humans in the age of digitally connected minds.","26. Get ready for the future: BE YOUR OWN ROBOT","In his talk Sander Veenhof will be discussing the implications of wearable technology and social media on humanity, and the new challenges facing the world. Humans used to trust our analog senses and intuition, but people are now getting used to trust the guidance of devices. In his talk, Sander will be inspiring us to think critically about the new rules we need to create for this new virtual world."],"isopubdate":""}

Wylie worked on Cambridge Analytica’s “information operations” in 2014 and 2015.","Wylie on Tuesday told the media committee of the British parliament that he “absolutely” believed Canadian consultant AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica’s databases for its work on the official Vote Leave campaign. The data could have been used to micro-target voters in the closely fought referendum in which 51.9% of voters ultimately backed Brexit.","Because of the links between the two companies, Vote Leave got the “the next best thing” to Cambridge Analytica when it hired Aggregate-IQ, “a company that can do virtually everything that (Cambridge Analytica) can do but with a different billing name,” Wylie said.","The testimony comes a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign. They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625,000 pounds to the pro-Brexit student group Be-Leave, then sending the money directly to AggregateIQ.","AggregateIQ said it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica and has never signed a contract with the company. The company also said it was 100% Canadian owned. “AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates.” AP","ZUCKERBERG SNUBS UK MPS:","Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday turned down a request by a British parliamentary panel to appear before them to respond to concerns about data privacy.

Ripon, the Wisconsin town where the Republican Party was founded in 1854, was the name given to a tool that let a campaign manage its voter database, target specific voters, conduct canvassing, manage fundraising and carry out surveys.

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

{"originalurl":"https://fynestuff.com/5-best-cryptocurrencies-in-each-category/","title":"The 5 Best Cryptocurrencies in Each Category » Fynestuff","text":["These are the best cryptocurrencies from each of the categories of supply chain, purely transactional, privacy cryptocurrency, protocol cryptocurrency and exchange specific cryptocurrency.","If you’ve been following the cryptocurrency markets for a long time (basically any time before December 2017, since time moves so fast in crypto land), you’ll realize that good tech wins out in the end. This means that over the long term, cryptocurrencies that add value to various technology platforms surrounding the space outperform gimmicks and speculative tokens. So if you want to hedge your bets, you need to pick out the best cryptocurrencies that aren’t speculative, solve real problems, have talented teams and have a reason to exist.","My article on the Safest Cryptocurrency Bets for 2018 did really well because I tried to follow the same line of thinking in choosing those coins, and they’ve held through the Jan/Feb dip.","Dividing your cryptocurrency portfolio into various functionality based use cases is one of the best ways to think about your assets. Let’s say supply chain tokens really take off in the next year or so, you don’t want to be left holding only currency coins. If platform tokens take a back seat to currency coins, you would want to hold some Litecoin or Nano. This article explores how hedging your bets with the best coins from various functionality perspectives would look like.","For this, I’ve chosen the following cryptocurrency function categories:","Supply chain cryptocurrency","Pure transactional cryptocurrency","Privacy/Untraceable cryptocurrency","dApp protocol cryptocurrency","Exchange specific cryptocurrency","The safest bet: a god tier store of value","Supply Chain Cryptocurrency: Waltonchain","This was a tough choice between the many likely contenders for success. Between Vechain, Waltonchain, INS Ecosystem, Ambrosus, QTUM, Shipchain and Origintrail, there’s a variety of projects with a huge depth of potential in this space. I chose Walton (WTC) because it’s the first mover and has the most stable partnerships, so if I were going for safe bets over potential 50x moon shots, this would be my choice. Waltonchain builds multi-layered programmable application interfaces, focuses on RFID tagging, and essentially forms a network for supply chain and inventory management. Compared to its peers, it’s further along the development pipeline and has completed major milestones recently such as its rebranding and industry partnerships (China Mobile, Fuyao Glass, Fujian ST Electronics).","While Ambrosus and INS are really interesting projects (they feature on my list for undervalued coins you can buy on Binance), they’re still low market-cap projects with a high degree of risk. Waltonchain has its ups and downs like any coin, but at this point in time it has more credibility than its competitor Vechain. With the Vechain rebranding imminent, the lack of details on the masternode sustainability, and its really weird trading volumes on Lbank, I would place my eggs in the Walton basket.","Pure Transactional Cryptocurrency: Nano","Transacting is a core function of cryptocurrency – it’s in the world itself. As Bitcoin slides into lower daily volumes (its lowest since 2016), coins like Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Nano are picking up the slack. Ethereum, while being a decent way to exchange value, doesn’t really fulfill the ‘purely transactional’ criteria. Neither does Ripple, since it’s being developed to be used as a messaging layer between banks. This leaves a few contenders like Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Nano. If you’re betting on an increase in the cryptocurrency on basically any metric (number of users, volume or merchant adoption) this year, you’re also betting that some project will emerge as the definitive medium of value transfer between users, merchants and exchanges.","I’ve chosen Nano over Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, because it has the largest scope for growth. The recent ‘Bitgrail hack‘ wasn’t a flaw with the technology of the network – the price dip was purely speculative and emotional. I still think Nano is one of the contenders for the most promising cryptocurrencies of the year. As for Litecoin, its Github activity is one of the lowest of any top 20 cryptocurrencies, and the fact that the founder sold his coins at the absolute all time high sends mixed signals on the project’s future relevancy. I’ve written more about the flaws with Bitcoin Cash in this article, and I’ve written about the incentive for users to run Nano nodes in this article.","Privacy Cryptocurrency: Monero","Is there really any choice in this category? I think it makes more sense to explain why there’s a privacy category rather than why Monero is the choice here. A privacy coin is a hedge against government regulation and loss of fungibility of crypto-assets. As the cryptocurrency markets develops, ‘hacked coins’ or coins that are known to have traversed through mediums that an institution doesn’t like, loses its value compared to other coins. It’s possible there’s a future where certain Bitcoins, with its publicly available ledger, become ‘blacklisted’ from major exchanges because it’s been through the hands of some shady individuals or governments. As Bitcoin and cryptocurrency becomes more popular, it’s also more likely that government regulation decreases the free flow of crypto-assets. An untraceable privacy coin like Monero gets around these barriers.","There are still some problems with Monero – some exchanges might ban huge volumes of Monero transactions under “anti money laundering regulations”. Competitors like Zclassic, Sumokoin and Bitcoin Private might prove to overthrow the king, but it will take a while before their tech is proven to be bulletproof. Enigma deserves a special mention as a potential smart contract+privacy behemoth. The technology behind Monero is solid, and similar to Bitcoin, the longer a cryptocurrency remains standing (without being hacked), the more valuable the network becomes.","Decentralized Application Protocol Cryptocurrency: 0x Protocol","There’s a lot of competition in this space:","Ethereum","EOS","NEM","Cardano","NEO","Lisk","And that’s just in the top 20 cryptocurrencies. If you go a little further down the list on Coinmarketcap, you’ll find a slew of great projects like Kyber Network, Enigma, and NULS. Protocols are going to be the backbone of the cryptocurrency technology boom. As the Winklevii said, “It allows you to own the racing field and not the horse. You don’t care who wins as long as the races are happening.”","The 0x protocol, on the other hand, is a very promising solution to the increasingly fragmented Ethereum ecosystem. While Ethereum has so far been the only real smart contract and tokenization platform, 0x allows multiple tokens to be exchanged on its own platform for free, which brings the advantages of network effects and interoperability between various ERC20 tokens. 0x has plans to operate with all cryptocurrencies in the future. It’s essentially a decentralized exchange relayer, and many projects, such as district0x and Ethfinex, are already using the 0x protocol. 0x is a riskier bet than Ethereum or NEO, but it’s a working product with a well-detailed roadmap.","Exchange Specific Cryptocurrency: Binance Coin","Exchanges are starting to use crypto-economics to offer incentives that bring people to their platform. A referral program simply isn’t enough to sway people to use a new exchange. This is where a token comes in, and most of them provide additional incentives such as reduced trading fees and volume based rewards. Binance went from being unknown to the largest exchange in the world in the span of 6 months. Its founder is an ex-Wall Street maverick who’s now a billionaire thanks to Binance’s low fees, popular referral program, huge list of coins and service reliability. An exchange token is an important part of any diverse asset portfolio since it represents volumes and interests of all coins on that exchange, as well as the growth of cryptocurrencies as a whole.","Binance beats out other exchange tokens such as Coss, Kucoin Shares, and DOT because of Binance’s reputation and growth over the last year. With ever increasing volumes, an influx of new users as well as BNB token burn, Binance is the safest exchange token bet.","The Safest Cryptocurrency Bet","The answer is still the same as in my article on the top safest cryptocurrency bets. So check out that article for the answer. Hint: it’s not any of the 5 on this list.","Conclusion","The 5 best cryptocurrencies from different functionality perspectives are:","Supply chain cryptocurrency: Waltonchain","Pure transactional cryptocurrency: Nano","Privacy/Untraceable cryptocurrency: Monero","dApp protocol cryptocurrency: 0x Protocol","Exchange specific cryptocurrency: Binance Coin","A good portfolio should have a good balance of risky as well as safe bets. It should also be functionally diverse, and split across several market cap categories. The cryptocurrencies on this list are large market cap cryptos with established identities and use cases. Factors that I’ve used to create this list are time the technology has been around, its competition, use case and market cap. If you think I’ve missed out on a crypto or an important category, leave a comment below or on Twitter or Facebook!","I have not heard of all of these, so thanks for sharing! The way you broke them down into categories is logical and useful as well. I am going to check out Monero. I am really attracted to the privacy component there."],"isopubdate":"2018-02-26"}

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","The congressional hearings were prompted by revelations that data consultancy Cambridge Analytica had wrongfully obtained personal information on at least 30 million American Facebook users.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we’ve found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I’ll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users – and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","In the United States, three congressional committees requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at a hearing in April focused broadly on Silicon Valley’s data privacy practices.

Stormy Daniels is no such thing, She’s an actress in, and director of, adult films, an auteur, if you like, at least a sex worker, toiling in the rolling mills of eros, sweating and grunting as much as any Mahoning Valley steel worker, or hood ornament buffer on the Tesla assembly line. And anyway, three times over the years she denied having sex with that man, at least once in writing, though last night on CBS’s Sixty Minutes she stated that she actually did have sex with the Golden Golem of Greatness.","In which case, she may be some kind of a lyin’ hoor... or savior of a nation yearning to cast off the loathsome rule of this odious president-by-mistake.","The Sixty Minutes make-up and costume crew knocked themselves out coming up with her on-camera look Sunday night: WalMart Shopper.","That reddish blouse, for instance, which did not display Stormy’s… er… assets in the usual way (i.e., an enticing fleshy slot descending into deep milky realms of mystery), but just innocently swimming around in there like a couple of frolicking dolphins confined in an above-the-ground backyard pool. Who wouldn’t want to jump in and swim with them?","Maybe not the undistractible Anderson Cooper, who did ferret out many interesting particulars of that one romantic encounter: Stormy accepted Trump’s invitation for dinner… in his hotel suite. Just the two of them, ahem. They watched a TV show about sharks. It apparently lacked aphrodisiac punch. So he showed her a magazine with his picture on the cover, perhaps to get the point across that he was a really important person in case she didn’t already know. She said she ought to take it and spank him with it. He concurred, dropped trou, and presented the rear of his tighty-whitey small-clothes to facilitate that proposal. After that ice-breaker, he said, “I really like you!” and “You remind me of my daughter” — instantly be-sliming the proceedings with overtones of incest. Stormy went to the bathroom and emerged to find Trump perched on the bed. “Here we go,” the thought popped into her head, she says.","But she didn’t say “no.” After all, was this performance that much different from the… I dunno, just guessing… 1043 previous scenes with co-stars she had enacted amorous relations with on-camera? Surely not all of them were husband-material, or crushes.","Oh, she didn’t ask him to wear a condom, and he didn’t gallantly volunteer to do so. (A love-child was not conceived.)

That will be an interesting hook-up, all right. I have to say, Mr. Mueller would probably benefit from a spanking with the Penn Law Review, and who knows what side benefits might accrue from the encounter. Perhaps Stormy will wear a pair of Russian army tactical Spetsnaz boots instead of those four-inch heels and a Russian bearskin hat. I’d pay to see a film of that!"],"isopubdate":""}

Axios is reporting that Trump is trying to change Amazon's tax treatment.\nBuzz60","SAN FRANCISCO — The possibility that President Trump wanted to \"go after\" Amazon caused the retail giant to lose tens of millions of dollars in market value Wednesday, even after the White House downplayed any plans to take action.","But despite Amazon's seemingly inexorable growth — including its build-up in groceries, entertainment and health care — there's very little the president or the federal government could do under current antitrust practices. As for taxes: Amazon already collects state sales tax in all states that have them, though it could be vulnerable to any new tax efforts.","“The President can hate Amazon all he wants, but he has limited power to do much about it,” said Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.","The furor arose after news website Axios published a story Wednesday, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump is considering whether to change Amazon's tax treatment because of the impact the online giant has had on smaller retailers.","While the White House downplayed the report, Trump himself tweeted Thursday that he has long had concerns about Amazon.","\"Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!\" Trump tweeted.","I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!","Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that the White House favors an Internet sales tax. There have been efforts in Congress to force all e-commerce companies to collect state sales tax, but Amazon already does that. Those moves are more likely to hit smaller e-tailers.","Amazon, and most other e-commerce companies, didn’t collect state sales taxes when they launched in the 1990s, using laws dating back as long as 50 years made for catalog retailers.","That allowed them to keep prices low and gain market share as online sales were just beginning. However, Amazon and other big e-commerce companies now routinely collect state sales taxes.","The one area where Amazon and others might be vulnerable is on local sales taxes, which most e-commerce companies don't collect and which stores have complained puts them at a disadvantage.","The federal government could decide to try help municipalities collect those taxes but thus far hasn't pushed in that direction.","Antitrust off the table","Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos(Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images)","Another beef Trump has long had with Amazon is over its size. Even during his campaign, he questioned Amazon's treatment. During an interview in May 2016 with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump claimed Bezos has a big antitrust issue related to Amazon.","There's not a lot of room for the government to maneuver on that issue, antitrust experts say.","Even if it did, it would be difficult to make an antitrust case against Amazon because that's not what antitrust law is meant to do these days.","“U.S. law is that we don’t necessarily go after monopolies or concentrated industries and break them up. It’s more prospective, if there’s some merger that’s going to happen,” said Christopher Snyder, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College and expert on industry organization.","Even going back to 1982 and the government-mandated breakup of telecommunications giant AT&T, it only happened because AT&T was a regulated industry. “That’s not the case here,” Snyder said.","Probably the strongest antitrust case that could be made against Amazon is for price discrimination or predatory pricing against competitors, “but even those are thin,” said Sucharita Kodali, a senior retail analyst at consulting firm Forrester Research.","U.S. law around antirust has shifted dramatically from the 1890s, when it focused on breaking up big companies. The modern emphasis has been on consumer welfare. If bigger companies lowered prices or made things easier for consumers, antitrust was no longer an issue.","Given Amazon long-stated goal to \"delight\" customers with either lower prices or fast delivery, it's difficult to make that case against the Seattle company.","Unspoken in all this is the concern that the president might harbor antipathy for Amazon because its CEO is Jeff Bezos. He is not only liberal but also owns the The Washington Post newspaper, which has spent the last year covering the president in often unflattering investigations.","“The president doesn’t like The Washington Post, and Bezos’ ownership makes him associate Amazon with the Post,” Pachter said.","When Trump tweeted last year that Amazon was harming tax-paying retailers, the tweet came hours after an editorial was published by the Post with the headline \"Mr. Trump gives comfort to racists.\"","In July, Trump tweeted that many stories about him in the Post were \"fake news.\" In another tweet he said \"Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?\"","Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?","Amazon is currently exploring cities in the U.S., including Washington, D.C., as well as Toronto, as a potential home for the company's coveted second headquarters.

That means that around 300,000 people could sign up for a personality test quiz, and in the process hand over information of 150 times that number.","Now, however, Facebook apps are only allowed to gather information from users who have directly signed up for them, greatly limiting their reach. That change was made in 2014, and rolled out to every Facebook app over the course of 2015.","But it’s still the case that apps which you have directly enabled can harvest a significant amount of data from your account – often information which you might be surprised to know you’re handing over.","The app settings page on Facebook is the place to manage the apps you’ve given access to. Clicking on the link will bring up a list of apps under “logged in with Facebook”. Hopefully you’ll recognise most of them – if there’s any you don’t, consider clicking the “X”, deauthorising them from your account.","No one can pretend Facebook is just harmless fun any more | Ellie Mae O’Hagan","Read more","You might also want to click on the edit button under the “apps others use” heading lower down the page. This takes you to your privacy settings for the modern version of the same feature Cambridge Analytica profited from. The information others can hand over on your behalf is limited, but still includes data such as your date of birth, religious and political views, and activities, interests and things you like. Consider unchecking all the boxes. According to Facebook, leaving them all checked will make your friends’ “experience better and more social”, which doesn’t seem like a good trade-off for you.","If that’s not enough for you to feel safe, maybe now’s the time to delete your Facebook account altogether.","That’s somewhat harder to do. If you go through the account settings, Facebook will attempt to push you to “deactivate” your account, which “will disable your profile and remove your name and photo from most things that you’ve shared on Facebook”. Notably, it won’t remove any of your data from Facebook’s servers, and your account lies dormant hoping you will change your mind.","If you actually want to delete your information from Facebook, the real setting is hidden in a help document with the title “how do I permanently delete my account?” Clicking on “let us know” on that page will take users to the real account deletion screen. Clicking “delete my account” will take you to another screen. Filling in your password and proving you aren’t a robot on that screen will finally… deactivate your account. Wait two weeks after that, and then, at long last, Facebook will begin the 90 day process of deleting all your data from the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Chris Wylie’s claims center around the official Vote Leave campaign and its links to a group called BeLeave, which it helped fund. The links allegedly allowed the campaign to bypass spending rules. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant)","by Danica Kirka, AP","LONDON (AP) — The computer expert who alleges a trove of Facebook data was improperly used to help Donald Trump’s White House bid said Tuesday that he strongly believes the information was also used by the Brexit movement that persuaded Britain to quit the European Union.","In a 3½-hour hearing, Chris Wylie told the House of Commons media committee that he believes the breach exceeded the 50 million Facebook users reported earlier — though he didn’t give an exact figure. And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it.","“All kinds of people had access to the data,” said Wylie, who helped develop Cambridge Analytica’s methods for using the information to target and persuade voters. “It was everywhere.”","Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ, a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave, the official campaign backing Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, Wylie said.","Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company, SCL Group, that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun-for-hire, often in countries where democratic institutions are weak. He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost.","The 28-year-old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013. He left the next year.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign. It denies any wrongdoing.","Cambridge Analytica’s acting CEO, Alexander Tayler, said in a statement that Wylie was a part-time contractor who “has no direct knowledge of our work or practices” since he left the company.","Wylie said he “absolutely” believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica’s databases for its work on the Brexit campaign. In the closely fought referendum in 2016, 51.9 percent of voters backed Britain’s departure from the EU.","“I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning,” Wylie said.","He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn’t want to relocate to Britain. The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a “department,” he said.","Because of the links between the two companies, Vote Leave got the “the next best thing” to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ, “a company that can do virtually everything that (Cambridge Analytica) can do but with a different billing name,” Wylie said.","AggregateIQ, based in Victoria, British Columbia, issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL.","“AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates,” the company said. “All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client.”","Wylie’s testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign.","They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625,000 pounds ($888,000) to the pro-Brexit student group BeLeave, which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ.","Ozark Radio News is a division of the Ozark Radio Network.

He said that the so-called psychography profiles combined Facebook data with information gathered from other \"top commercial data providers\" and that data included specific information about voter \"demographics, geographics, purchase history, and interests.\"","When a Facebook user engaged with the survey, he said, the user implicitly gave the company access to a broad spectrum of personal data that Facebook provides for advertisers. The app reached further, giving the company access to profile data from people in the users' broader circle of Facebook friends who had, wittingly or otherwise, set their security setting relatively weakly. Though the company likely did not use a traditional \"hack\" to access user information, they may have violated Facebook's terms of use by bulk harvesting and repurposing user data.","When asked about how the company chose what to include in Facebook surveys, Oczkowski would only say that, it collects data from \"exclusive relationships\" with data vendors \"and through direct response projects.\"","Cambridge Analytica pushed back Saturday against the notion that it harvested any data, insisting it had contracted a firm in the U.K. to do research. Cambridge Analytica insisted that when it learned that it had been sold data it shouldn't have, the firm deleted the data.","Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data. 1/8","\"Inner Demons\"","Getting users to interact with the survey was key to unlocking the data. A source close to the 2016 Trump campaign and familiar with Cambridge Analytica's tactics explained that the surveys used by the company used inflammatory language designed to provoke the \"worst tendencies\" in Facebook users -- meaning that it would stir up the kind of emotion that would prompt an interaction. Cambridge Analytica said Saturday it did not use any Facebook data for the campaign. Mr. Trump's 2016 digital guru, Brad Parscale, told \"60 Minutes\" last year that the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's controversial practice of psychographics.","Cambridge Analytica specializes in psychographics, which microtargets ads based on personality. In the words of whistleblower Christopher Wylie: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons.\"","That allowed the company to scale up their data gathering rapidly. Wired reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN Saturday that by convincing 270,000 people to interact with the app, GSR managed to tap into the data of over 50 million users.","CEO Alexander Nix described the firm as \"fundamentally politically agnostic and an apolitical organization,\" and even tweeted Saturday that President Obama's 2012 \"pioneered microtargeting.\"","But Oczkowski contradicted that assertion, and explained that \"we served as the data agency of record, but our role quickly evolved as the cycle progressed.\"","The company developed \"three pillars\" of exclusive technology, Oczkowski said, including data science and analytics, digital marketing designed for persuasion and get-out-the-vote (GOTV), and polling research. \"Having a large amount of control and input into each of these three areas allowed us to be extremely efficient and reactive,\" he said. \"It also allowed us to easily integrate with the staff at Giles-Parscale and the RNC.\"","When asked specifically how the company leveraged Facebook for other data, Oczkowski explained that the company's data analytics prowess assisted the Trump campaign for everything from resource allocation, calculating the most efficient candidate travel stops, advertising, and the language used in surrogate speeches, and even \"personalizing messaging to the individual voter.\"","\"Huge exaggeration\"","Within GOP data circles, however, the company's extravagant claims about the effectiveness of Facebook data and artificial intelligence are heavily criticized. \"I'm not saying they lied,\" said a former Trumpworld staffer shortly after the election, \"but for Cambridge Analytica to run victory laps and claim they won the election for Trump is a huge exaggeration. Data can do a lot of things, but there's a limit to how effective it is. Cambridge Analytica's claims went far beyond that limit.\"","Cambridge Analytica is not alone in their use of Facebook and social media to target consumers with advertising. Machine learning is one of the fastest growing sectors of business technology, and a number of firms have adopted similar tactics. Amazon, Google, Twitter, and a host of other cloud-based Internet giants are hiring AI experts and building algorithms that automate advertising.","It's no surprise that cloud giants are actively using big data analysis models to aid private industry in everything from cybersecurity to marketing. Oczkowski described the potential application actionable data scraped from Facebook users as potentially \"endless.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February.","“It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Mr. Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side.","Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew.","The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used.","Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.”","Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.","“The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Mr. Stamos tweeted.","The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data.","“Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.”","Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited.","“Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Mr. Albright said.","Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said.","This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers.","There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations.","On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter.","Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie.","By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports.","In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as “a curious and naïve 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica.","“I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.”","His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data.","Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting.","In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it.","Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said.","In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article.","Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California — called for investigations of the Facebook data leak.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,” said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee.","Correction:","An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Senator Amy Klobuchar on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Kennedy joins call for Facebook's Zuckerberg to testify on Cambridge Analytica 'breach' | State Politics | theadvocate.com","text":["Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy joined a Democratic colleague Monday in calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appear before Congress to explain reports that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica inappropriately harvested data from tens of millions of personal Facebook accounts.","Stories in the New York Times and the British newspaper The Observer (an affiliate of The Guardian) on Sunday detailed how Cambridge Analytica — which worked on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign — allegedly gained inappropriate access to data from 50 million Facebook profiles. Facebook first became aware of the massive breach in 2015, the newspapers reported.","That total represents nearly a quarter of potential American voters. The trove of personal data was reportedly used \"to conduct sophisticated psychological targeting for political ads in order to influence voters,\" Kennedy and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, wrote in a letter Monday morning.","\"The reports further indicate that Facebook knew about this breach more than two years ago and failed to acknowledge it and take swift and meaningful action,\" Kennedy and Klobuchar wrote to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican.","The senators urged Grassley to haul Zuckerberg and the top executives from two other powerful Silicon Valley corporations — Twitter and Google — before the committee to discuss why current protections for user data are falling short.","Kennedy and Klobuchar's letter also raise questions about whether there is adequate regulation of political advertising on social media. Similar advertising in traditional media outlets, including television and newspapers, is bound by certain requirements, such as federal rules governing reporting about political advertisements on television and radio.","\"The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights,\" Kennedy and Klobuchar wrote.","Kennedy said he’s not seeking to impose new regulations on Facebook or other powerful internet companies. But Kennedy said Facebook also possesses “immense” and “undeniable” power through its ability to tap into personal information on billions of worldwide users.","The senator said he wants further hearings to try to figure out “who they're sharing that data with, under what terms, and how they're safeguarding that data so that people's privacy isn't usurped or undermined.”","The latest reporting on Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data has added fuel to growing demands by lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Silicon Valley companies to explain how social-media platforms have been abused to push political propaganda.","Kennedy last week urged Grassley to call in top decision-making executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter to answer congressional questions, adding that lawyers for those companies “didn’t say a damn thing” when they appeared before Congress last year to address attempted Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.","“We can talk frankly about the fact that some of the other countries are using social media to try and influence our elections and what if anything we should do about it,” Kennedy told Bloomberg News last Thursday.","Kennedy, a first-term lawmaker who took his Senate seat at the beginning of 2017, has drawn attention before for raising critical questions about Facebook's massive data-collection efforts.","At an October hearing on how Russian government-affiliated operatives might have used social-media platforms to influence the 2016 election, Kennedy grilled attorneys for Facebook, Google and Twitter over their inability to keep close track of advertisers or determine whether foreign powers are paying for political ads targeting American users.","\"I think you do enormous good, but your power sometimes scares me,\" Kennedy said at the hearing.","Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch, acknowledged to Kennedy at the hearing that the company couldn’t track the original source of ads from its roughly 5 million monthly advertisers but denied that advertisers or Facebook staffers could pull data about individual users — a claim Kennedy has been skeptical of.","“They (Facebook) know more about me than I do,” Kennedy told The Advocate Monday afternoon. “That's true of most Americans, that's true of a lot of people in the world.”","Shares of Facebook tumbled Monday amid the gathering fallout from the Cambridge Analytica data breach, closing Monday down nearly 8 percent, the biggest single-day drop for the company’s stock in nearly four years.","The company said over the weekend that the data was gathered legitimately by an academic researcher at Cambridge University in England but that the researcher broke company rules by sharing it with Cambridge Analytica. Facebook also contended they’d ordered Cambridge Analytica to delete the data in 2015, something whistleblowers told The New York Times didn’t happen.","Cambridge Analytica counts father and daughter Republican mega-donors Robert and Rebekah Mercer, as well as former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon, among its early investors. Bannon and Rebekah Mercer sit on the firm's board.","British and European Union politicians have reacted to the reports with outrage and with calls for an investigation into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. The weekend reports on Cambridge Analytica also strongly suggested its chief executive mislead Britain’s Parliament by claiming in testimony last month that the firm hadn't gathered or used Facebook data.","Despite those prior denials, Cambridge Analytica acknowledged in a statement to the New York Times that it had indeed acquired the data.","But Cambridge Analytica blamed the researcher who provided the data for breaking Facebook's terms of service and contended to the newspaper that it'd deleted the data when alerted to how it was obtained two years ago, a claim at odds with The Times' reporting.","Critics of Facebook have pointed to the most recent revelations as further signs that the powerful social-media company — which also owns Instagram and the popular messaging platform WhatsApp — needs to face tighter government regulation.","Political advertising on social-media platforms — including evidence that outfits linked to Russian intelligence agencies bought ads and set up thousands of fake Facebook and Twitter accounts in an effort to influence the 2016 election — has brought intense scrutiny of the companies in recent months.","\"Fundamentally, this is about Facebook's abuse of power,\" said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute who's been critical of what he termed Facebook's monopoly power in online advertising. \"Facebook just doesn't obey the law.\"","Stoller described the sheer volume of information amassed by Facebook — some of it deeply personal — and its ability to harness that data to target ads based on personal traits, preferences and even moods as a “frightening level of power.”","Kennedy’s questioning of Facebook counsel at the October hearing was “shockingly good,” Stoller said, saying it drilled down into Facebook’s lax oversight of the advertisers using its platforms.","But Kennedy said he doesn’t have any intention of pushing tougher government oversight of Facebook, which he described as “a wonderful American company.”","“I'm not going into this hearing with any sort of ulterior motives — I'm not looking to punish anybody or regulate anybody,” Kennedy said. “I hope they'll be forthcoming.”","Some Senate Democrats, however, are pushing for additional regulation of social media companies. Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who penned Monday’s letter with Kennedy, wrote a bill with Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner that would require social-media platforms to file reports on political advertisements. Ailing Sen. John McCain of Arizona is the lone Republican to sign onto that bill so far.","Others have raised the possibility that the Federal Trade Commission could use an existing 2011 consent decree it struck with Facebook over allegations the company misled users about privacy settings to punish it for the potential violations in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The massive data breach that allowed Cambridge Analytica to reportedly stockpile data on 50 million users — including enough information to construct detailed profiles of about 30 million people — raises the possibility that Facebook violated that consent decree, a charge that Facebook explicitly denied in statements over the weekend.","The Cambridge University academic who collected the data trove convinced roughly 270,000 users to install a Facebook-linked app to participate in a research survey, according to The Observer and The New York Times. The users were told only that the data would be used in research, not that it would be passed along to a political consulting firm.","As many as 50 million more users who'd never consented to have their data collected by the academic also had information swept up in the effort, according to the reports.","Success!

Facebook declined immediate comment.","In a tweet, Stamos did not deny he was leaving but said: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change.”","The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","London-based Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denied the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party application in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","However, further allegations about the firm’s tactics were reported late Monday by British broadcaster Channel 4 which said it secretly taped interviews with senior Cambridge Analytica executives in which they boasted of their ability to sway elections in countries around the world with digital manipulation and traditional political trickery.","Cambridge Analytica rejected the allegations, saying in a statement that the Channel 4 report “is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”","Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from the U.S. Congress after the reports in the New York Times and London’s Observer over the weekend.","Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Widen sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties.","Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.","Facebook and other social media companies including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled.","Late on Monday, the Connecticut Attorney General said the office will initiate an inquiry into Facebook data policies.","The Senate was expected to move forward on Monday with a bill that would chip away at the internet industry’s legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking. The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law.","Facebook said on Friday it had learned in 2015 that a Cambridge University psychology professor lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from a psychology testing application he had built.","Facebook said it suspended the firms and researchers involved and said the data had been misused but not stolen, because users gave permission.","“(Tech companies) are going to get a lot more scrutiny over what data they are collecting and how they are using it,” said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.","‘VERY CONCERNING’","European officials, who have been more willing to regulate Silicon Valley companies than their U.S. counterparts, were strident in criticism of Facebook.","The revelations about Cambridge Analytica were “horrifying, if confirmed,” said EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova. “We don’t want this in the EU and will take all possible legal measures” including stricter rules under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation that takes effect in May, she said.","A spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said the allegations were “clearly very concerning.”","The head of the European Parliament said EU lawmakers will investigate possible data misuse, calling the allegations an unacceptable violation of citizens’ privacy rights.","(This version of the story refiles to fix spell check errors of proper names and ticker symbol)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

It was the marketing industry that first paved the path when it pounced on the abundance of information being freely disclosed by social media users as a way to target advertisements and drive sales.","“Cambridge Analytica has turned public attention to what had been a long-standing blind spot in Canadian politics,” he said.","“The ways that routine practices of data collection, advertising and voter profiling can be used by bad actors is a reminder that all parties need to stand up and be more accountable about their data practices.”","McKelvey pointed out that now-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau enlisted the help of the U.S.-based campaign software company NGP VAN for his leadership bid and the subsequent federal election race.","NGP VAN is the same outfit Barack Obama relied on during his presidential bids. The company website advertises its ability to link emails in a voter database to nearly 100 different social networking sites, including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.","A major concern is that the algorithm that decides who sees what ad is hidden, McKelvey said, and the public simply has no way to know about the potential of so-called dark targeting -whether some ads are being used to suppress voting.","Political campaigns have been getting more targeted for years as big data becomes increasingly available and the raw power of data analytics and computing continues to grow, said Alfred Hermida, a digital media scholar at the University of British Columbia.","Hermida said the move is fuelled in part by what he calls a Silicon Valley approach – that whatever the world’s problems, technology is the answer. It’s a perspective that ignores the fact that technology is a tool that can be used for both good and bad, he said.","“The failing here is … not realizing that actually the same technology that you can use to bring people together around a cause can be used to identify people with certain political views and serve them very specific political ads,” Hermida said.","“Technological utopianism expects things to be good and doesn’t take into account, ‘How do we mitigate for people using this for nefarious purposes?’ ”","That latter phenomenon is something Anatoliy Gruzd, Canada’s research chair in social media data stewardship, has noticed in some non-Western regimes.","While some more totalitarian states have blocked or restricted social media usage, others have begun to use those same tools for their own purposes, such as to distribute propaganda or to disrupt the politics in rival countries, he said.","The phenomenon of data harvesting dates back decades. Mark Blevis, a digital public affairs strategist based in Ottawa, said companies would historically use information provided on warranty forms to contact buyers about other purchases they may want to make, or about a replacement when a product was nearing the end of its life span.","He described how politics has been cosying up with the marketing industry for years, which has mirrored a move toward political parties treating voters like consumers and campaigns as vote-shopping expeditions.","“People may not like this, but this is the way it’s always been,” Blevis said. “It’s just the tools are more widely available now.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

What you can do is rely on data,\" Roe told the Post.","He didn't respond to an interview request on Monday.","At the time, the Cruz campaign had spent just $750,000 with Cambridge Analytica, and the firm reportedly had staffers embedded at the Cruz campaign's headquarters in Houston.","As the Post reported:","To develop its psychographic models, Cambridge surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored individuals using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.

That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said.","The Cruz campaign modified the Cambridge template, renaming some psychological categories and adding subcategories to the list, such as \"stoic traditionalist\" and \"true believer.\" The campaign then did its own field surveys in battleground states to develop a more precise predictive model based on issues preferences.","The Cruz algorithm was then applied to what the campaign calls an \"enhanced voter file,\" which can contain as many as 50,000 data points gathered from voting records, popular websites and consumer information such as magazine subscriptions, car ownership and preferences for food and clothing."],"isopubdate":""}

On Wednesday it will take evidence from a former Facebook operations manager, Sandy Parakilas.","The letter gave a deadline of 26 March for a response.","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","A White House spokesman said Donald Trump would welcome investigations into the breach.","“The president believes that Americans’ privacy should be protected. You know, if Congress wants to look into the matter or other agencies want to look into the matter, we welcome that,” the deputy press secretary Raj Shah told Fox News. “Without knowing the specifics, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual should testify but we do support the privacy of American citizens.”","The company issued a statement on Tuesday saying it was outraged at the developments. The statement said: “[CEO] Mark [Zuckerberg], [COO] Sheryl [Sandberg] and their teams are working around the clock to get all the facts and take the appropriate action moving forward, because they understand the seriousness of this issue.","“The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”","The company’s stock market stock’s woes continued on Tuesday, as the share price dropped 3.5% to drop to around 17% below last month’s all-time high,","The inquiries followed revelations of how data from Facebook was deployed by Cambridge Analytica (CA) without users’ consent, and of boasts by CA to undercover reporters about the role it could play in political campaigns.","The UK’s information commissioner has announced her intention to investigate CA, but on Tuesday she was still awaiting a warrant to enter its central London offices. A Huffington Post reporter said he had seen about 10 crates of documents being removed from the building, which is shared with other tenants.","The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said it wasn’t responsible for removing any files.","Crates filled with documents have been seen being removed from the same building as Cambridge Analytica's HQ. Their provenance cannot be verified. A delivery person did not answer questions, while a van driver said: \"No comment\". pic.twitter.com/mBPEYZxmQw","The commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said she had also demanded that Facebook halt an data audit of CA which had commenced, saying it could prejudice her investigation.","Cybersecurity consultants from Stroz Friedberg, who had been engaged by Facebook to do the audit, were at CA’s office in London on Monday evening when the ICO asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue their own investigation.","Collins said it was extraordinary that Facebook’s investigators had been in the CA office, and he questioned their motives.","“We were told this last night and I don’t think the information commissioner was aware of that at that time,” he told the BBC. “This is a matter for the authorities. Facebook sent in data analysts and lawyers who they appointed; what they intended to do there, who knows?","“The concern would have been: were they removing information or evidence which could have been vital to the investigation? It’s right they stood down but it’s astonishing they were there in the first place.”","In a statement on Tuesday, CA said it had been in touch with the Information Commissioner’s Office since February 2017, when it had hosted its team in its London office.","“Since early last year we have subsequently cooperated with the ICO on multiple lines of inquiry, including most recently on the Facebook data and derivatives that we received from GSR, the research company that we engaged in good faith to legally supply data for research.","“On this point we have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}
{"originalurl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16606924","title":"50M Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach | Hacker News","text":["My problem with this 'outing' of CA is that Facebook explicitly commercially exists to harvest user data for Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Fidelity etc etc so they can profile us. A million dollars is chump change in the crazy US election game. This all seems overly selective - it's ok for some people to profile but not for others. I'm not in favor of any of it to be clear but there is a definite political bias going on here.\nLet's not forget FB itself has a formal political unit that exists to push propaganda in foreign elections, 'stifling opposition and stoking extremism'",">This all seems overly selective - it's ok for some people to profile but not for others","What's the issue here? Selective information distribution is rooted in the society, people are O.K. with some information to be known to some people while kept secret from others due to implication differences.","I.E. I'm fine to be profiled for selling me chocolates but I'm not O.K. to be profiled to be manipulated to select public officials or to make my mind about controversial topics like the god, abortions, guns etc. I expect to be exposed in a proper way to these topics, i.e. proper journalism and discussions.","Sadly, the downside of the consumer data culture in which we live is that you don’t really get to make that call. It seems like data is really an all or nothing game at this point, regardless of how society feels about it. Not sure how to change that, either, and I don’t personally think legislation is the answer.","Look at health records. HIPAA is rather successful at keeping your health data narrowly confined to those that need it. There is nothing that prevents similar laws to work for financial data, location data, etc.","The only roadblock is people saying they “don’t personally think legislation is the answer”. Because there is literally nothing but law that can have an effect.","But let's also agree that preventing gossip about private health info is a good thing -- a definite step in the right direction.","Laws are about building and reinforcing the culture we want to build. In that light, HIPPA is a long way from a failure: it sets the standard that \"health care privacy is to be taken seriously, and as a society we believe it is important enough to legislate\", if nothing else.","I've heard a lot of people believe otherwise (including a sibling post), so probably best to bring in evidence/sources. Here's Facebook's statement on it: \"No, we don't sell any of your information to anyone and we never will.\" From https://www.facebook.com/help/152637448140583","So if you believe Facebook sells your information, then you also believe that Facebook is directly lying about it on a help page about that specific topic. Sometimes conspiracy theories are true, so it's not impossible that that's what happening, but it's not like Facebook is openly selling your information.","Until 2014 or so an app could request permission to view almost any data a user stores on Facebook. That's not great, but hey, you could argue it's not Facebook's fault that people don't understand permission prompts (I'd disagree with you, but...). But those same prompts allowed users to give away their friend's data, so absolutely anyone you're friends with could take some stupid personality test and give away your information in the process, and there was no way you'd even know.","You always need to parse statements like this very carefully. Pretty much any other company who isn't providing your information to others says \"we do not share your data with unaffiliated entities...\"","Facebook said that they don't sell your information. Which is true -- they aren't a data broker. But they implicitly state that your data is shared, subject to the limited controls available. You cannot stop Amazon and Facebook from sharing, for example.","do you understand how this data ended up in CA's hands? Regular facebook app asked persmission to get data to it's users, one by one. It then retained the data and shared without facebook or their users permission (and against FB terms). Then facebook realized this data was shared, required CA to delete all of it. CA agreed. CA didn't delete. That's how we are here","I'm no facebook fan by the way, but there's no reason for facebook to sell their most important asset when they can allow you to pay to use it, without ever seeing it","Neubecker said he has seen several ads on his Facebook feed that link to Trian’s “Revitalize P&G” website and to videos of Peltz and former P&G Chief Financial Officer Clayton Daley, who is advising Trian.","The video of Peltz features him sitting in Trian’s Park Avenue, New York City headquarters, discussing P&G’s future, gripping a Trian-labeled coffee mug that reads “Sales up, expenses down.”","In response, P&G has called upon more than a century of product marketing experience with its own “Vote Blue” campaign.","One YouTube video begins with an image of P&G’s blue logo and a banner proclaiming “Every Single Vote Matters!”. A narrator and series of slick images offer step-by-step instructions, ending by asking viewers to vote for the blue proxy card and to throw Trian’s white card in the recycling bin.","Pardon my ignorance but what was Cambridge Analytica doing if not using advanced analytics for Facebook targeting?","I don't think Facebook has a section where someone can talk about what stocks they might hold. So, if the HF was able to target specific people who owned P&G stocks then I think it was an efficient targeting, maybe not as much of scale of US elections but enough to turn the voting in their favor.","I could see a constitutional amendment barring psycho-graphic profiling from election advertising and intent. Not sure how it could be enforced because this is very technical.","Even so, there is a significant difference between Coke trying to sell me a flavored soft drink and a firm tweaking my emotions to get me to abstain from voting with false information or to vote against my best interests with false information.","There are definitely people who are susceptible to psycho-graphic warfare and we need to protect them in order to protect our democracy.","I don't think \"false information\" is the kicker here. Taking a cursory glance at Breitbart and Fox News, there isn't that much that is patently false. Furthermore, my observations of how propaganda works in general is that it doesn't usually rely information that is technically false. It relies on selective distribution of information, editorial spin, and other more subtle methods.","This makes \"enforcement\" basically impossible because you can't have a news outlet without editorial decisions. A better way to go about it would be to try incentivize media outlets to make a good faith effort at \"both sides\" journalism, but members of both political sides have been attacking the media for doing just that since the 2016 election season.","In addition to Fox and Breitbart, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed, CNN, and even the New York Times have had to retract dozens of viral political articles over the last two years. The retractions were only seen by a fraction of the people who saw the original headlines. This is an inevitable result of journalism increasingly relying on rumor and catering to partisan audiences.","Where is this line that should be drawn, and who should draw it? Breitbart may have a higher frequency of “oops someone gave me bad info, or my reporter/editor made an unsubstantiated inference” events, but their audience is much smaller than the large outlets.","Sure, but the parent's point is that even if you got rid of the fake news, you'd still be able to spread plenty of propaganda and sway people. Going after the easy target of \"fake news\" might feel good, and even do something to help make propaganda less effective, but isn't going to make a huge dent in the problem.","Agreed. This is marketing. The tone of the article makes it sound like some egregiously illegal scandal. The only wrongdoing is that one private entity breached the terms of service with another private entity. Innuendo.","1. It is not normal marketing to have tens of millions of Facebook account data on your own private server. This isn't standard practice by any company large or small. Standard practice is to use Facebook's advertising system which does not reveal this data.","2. The wrongdoing wasn't just \"breaching the terms of service\" it was the transfer of account data from one party to another for the purposes of influencing an election.","\"There are other dramatic documents in Wylie’s stash, including a pitch made by Cambridge Analytica to Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil producer. In an email dated 17 July 2014, about the US presidential primaries, Nix wrote to Wylie: “We have been asked to write a memo to Lukoil (the Russian oil and gas company) to explain to them how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business. Nix said that “they understand behavioural microtargeting in the context of elections” but that they were “failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers”. The work, he said, would be “shared with the CEO of the business”, a former Soviet oil minister and associate of Putin, Vagit Alekperov.","“It didn’t make any sense to me,” says Wylie. “I didn’t understand either the email or the pitch presentation we did. Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?”\"","The thing about the relatively low cost of a million is that we know that many of the voters targeted by the Russians for influence on both sides were much cheaper than what your example commercial interests targeted for marketing services/products, so a million dollars on targeted campaign is much more effective than what that million dollars buys in a major media market TV ad equivalent or commercial Facebook targeted ad.","Your links do not support the idea of “harvest[ing] user data”. They describe the usual Facebook ad platform, where you can set criteria to target users. But nowhere does it mention data on individual users flowing from Facebook to advertisers.","'Politicians running for office can be lucrative ad buyers. For those who spend enough, Facebook offers customized services to help them build effective campaigns, the same way it would Unilever NV or Coca-Cola Co. ahead of a product launch.","While Facebook declined to give the size of its politics unit, one executive said it can expand to include hundreds during the peak of an election, drawing in people from the company’s legal, information security and policy teams.'","It is harder to find information about FB's data sales policies (which are very opaque unless you speak to people high up in marketing large companies and their activities). FB's ad platform information is pretty transparent, but the quarterly numbers don't really add up for me based on spend by large firms like Procter & Gamble etc in those areas...","Obviously you won't be finding a FB webpage providing details of where to buy user data by the thousands as I tried to explain above. FB\"s role working with and for the Trump campaign provides some insights","So I did. Then I scroll down to see \"See and Edit Marketing Data about You. CLICK HERE\" only to be redirected to a registration page that requires my US-based address and last 4 of SSN.","Talking about misled communication, or rather blunt deception, otherwise how the heck \"click here to see data about you\" lands me on registration page? I don't want to register, I want to see the data!","You can pay to get anonymized topic data via DataSift and others, you can pay to run ads against users you have email addresses for (but you don’t get their data) or you can scrape (which is against the terms of service and they have an aggressive anti bot system to stop it - unlike Twitter).","That is an egregious violation of the guidelines and a bannable offense on HN. If the rest of the internet is losing its mind, that makes following HN's rules more important, not less.","> Let's not forget about that one time you","This also crosses into personal attack, which is not ok. Heated political arguments are bad enough without users trying to take each other out like this. Please don't do it on HN, regardless of how strongly you disagree.","Edit: your account history unfortunately contains many examples of personal abuse. You've also broken the guideline against using HN primarily for political or ideological battle. We ban accounts that do these things, so would you please re-read the guidelines and use HN as intended from now on?","Something I have been noticing for quite some time now is an increasing tendency for people to seemingly believe they can read other people's minds &/or the future, or that they somehow have an omniscient insight into the world. You might expect this on Facebook or Reddit, and I know this will not please most people here, but it is becoming rather common on HN as well.","To those of you who disagree with me, keep this idea in the back of your mind for a while and remember it as you read comments. Make a serious effort to notice how many people know what other people's motives are for their beliefs, how they know the real reason for certain policy decisions, how they know what Putin or Trump are thinking and what they are going to do in the future, how they know China is going to fail now that they've gone full-on communist dictatorship (because history \"guarantees\" it), etc.","I honestly don't think I am imagining this, I think something very historically significant is happening to the psychology of the public.","There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that \"my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.\"","I remember when the Obama campaign hired data scientists and used targeted social networking tools to pursuade voters who were on the fence and it was heralded as brilliant and the future of politics.","I worked for a company crawling Facebook data by creating viral apps the year the original API came out. By now I am sure this is done by many companies.","Why is any of this news? My understanding is that companies harvesting social networking data via viral apps and then reselling it to perform targeted voter advertising is literally a 10 year old concept. Were any laws broken here? Were there any techniques used here that were novel or done by one political party and not the other? Why are we talking about this one firm and not the many others that surely exist that are trying to do the same thing for <insert political candidate of choice>","I am not shock by the facts that they are collecting data. The fact they are designing a psychological procedure to feed their narrative and agenda to you in an unconscious way, shaping and changing your world view, with that message only tailored to you, is very creepy to me. This doesn't sound like advertising to me, this is manipulation and brainwashing.","Explain the difference in semantics between the two because the mechanics sound the same, best I can tell this company was just running ads like everyone else. Creating psychological profiles of voters to craft messages to them to pursuade their vote I believe is the same thing as political advertising and is exactly what Obama's campaign were doing and had countless fawning articles written about them (just Google it.) Best I can tell the real facet here being used to paint this in a new light is the use of harvested data in a way that violated Facebook ToS but that is 100% nothing new and crawling FB via the API to do data science was a new idea like 10+ years ago (and it has since been locked down due to the prevalence of abuse I'd assume.)","Why is this hard to understand? The same technology can be used for both good and bad.","Obama used it to inform people about his polcies and get the out to vote. Trump used it to spread lies, falsehoods and half-truths. Essentially any media that was outlandish enough to become viral was promoted and promoted to hapless people who probably might have wondered why they were seeing so many distressing articles about America in \"Carnage\" (as Trump puts it).","So you are stating that the reverse interpretation where Obama spread lies and falsehoods, and smears his opponents while Trump was merely informing the public of truths is objectively just as valid as the opposite?","Just because something is political and not neutral does not mean that there are no facts associated with it. We may disagree on them, debate them, but to take the stance that there are none at all is the kind of tactic used by people who do not wish to debate the actual validity of their viewpoints.","It comes down to motivation. Obama is a career politician, but Bannon is an ideologist. The former seeks to get elected, the latter seeks to plant ideas and change the society in a fundamental way. To me, Bannon is much more dangerous than Obama, because he is subversive.","Technically, there might be little difference, but Bannon clearly excels at using this tool to a greater effect, and the result is far more impactful and outreaching, even revolutionary. Guaranteed, other groups will take notice and trying to replicate their success, to feed their version of personalized agenda to your month.","The biggest difference is Bannon wants to break society to that it can be remade as he wants. Classic villain methodology, where the ends justify the means. Creating and exploiting divisions in society, damaging democratic institutions, so that the Government collapses and Democracy along with it. To be replaced with 'his' vision for this country. That is evil and treasonous.","I agree with your discomfort on Bannon's agenda, but aren't you conceptually backwards here? If Bannon is evil not because of his agenda but because he wants to bring societal change, isn't the same true for Abraham Lincoln?","I guess the other question is why this hasn't been any news yet. But the answer might be that 10 years ago Tech wasn't much in the news because it was just not interesting for most people.","This has changed a lot in the last few years though, which might explain why the news agency now have to work through (at least!) 10 years of tech news backlog. I'd definitely like to see coverage of these topic from 'traditional journalists' who then bring this stuff into context and link it with politics for instance. It's a little sad that we needed the politic right and their friends to bring these things to public attention.","> Were any laws broken here?","In Germany they would have broken it by that. At least here every website needed already 10 years ago not only Terms of Services but also a data privacy section/page. Such a page would be of no use if you could collect data from people before they even visit your website.","These are only two links but let me assure you if you're interested google is full of articles from the 2008 election talking about how vital the internet and data was to the Obama strategy.","I very clearly remember these articles and many others at the time talking about the new \"big data\" strategies utilized in both 2008 and 2012. To me that is what makes this whole \"we scraped data and stole the election for trump\" narrative seem extremely suspicious.","> To me that is what makes this whole \"we scraped data and stole the election for trump\" narrative seem extremely suspicious.","Suspicious of what? Be more clear about what you're trying to say here please.","Because I hope it's not that people didn't complain enough when Obama did it, and therefore now nobody can? (aside from the fact that I did complain, because I complain about all advertising, but that's not the point)","The first one links to NYTimes Blog though. I mean now you see on general news coverage about cellphone chip companies -- absolutely uninteresting 10 years ago. Apparently voters were already manipulated to some degree at that time. But now it got even more. But at the same time technology immersed to much into day to day life that everybody is also interested in pure technology news.","On the other hand all journalists become more technical at the same time, so they have to digest some stuff from the past. Obviously even older news...","I guess it's fair to say that Techcrunch or ZDNet are not exactly great sources for usage of Big Data in politics...","> I remember when the Obama campaign hired data scientists and used targeted social networking tools to pursuade voters who were on the fence and it was heralded as brilliant and the future of politics.","If you go back to 2008 election, the media was praising Obama as the first social media president. Remember how well obama used youtube, myspace, facebook, reddit and the burgeoning social space during his election? It's strange how the media is now attacking the social media space they loved so much because trump won the election.","> Why is any of this news?","I think it's because the media and the democrats and a large segment of the elites need something to blame for trump's win. They don't want to blame hillary or themselves for the loss, so they attack social media.","During the 2016 election, Trump was complaining about foreign interference in the elections. And Obama stated there was no foreigner interference and that Trump was whining because he was losing in the polls. Back then, the traditional media was backing obama and mocking trump. Now that trump has won, the traditional media is the one pushing the foreign interference narrative.","But I guess it is all conjecture. But ever since trump won the election, there has been a relentless propaganda campaign against social media by the establishment. You can't go a day without seeing a propaganda piece on traditional or social media about how bad social media is.","If you had read the article, you would have seen that it is the elites who are running these operations. The \"liberals\" are not the ones who are the elites, it's the ones with money funding this sort of thing. It very clearly names the contributors, I suggest reading it.","There is still no evidence that 2008 had any foreign influence. The tactics used in 2008 did not include the sort of misinformation information warfare now being conducted.","In contrast, in Brexit and Trump's wins this article is claiming that there is conclusive foreign interference.","Regarding the establishment, the only propaganda campaigns I can see being waged are against the mainstream news (the ongoing fake news propaganda) and against the tech companies who I suppose are \"new money\" and not in with the oil and finance czars funding this sort of thing.","The article is really interesting, you should read it. It basically suggests that democracy has largely failed in the age of information warfare. Targeted campaigns by rich elites and foreign governments can now influence votes and psychology on a massive scale. It's no longer about \"my side and their side.\" All of us are on the losing side here.","I suppose. Why weren't people worried about this during obama's campaign?","> - The advertisements were not overt (\"fake news\") - It raises the barrier of entry to the political process - Filter bubble effects","If filter bubble effects are a problem, then we should be looking into traditional media, not social media. I'd say there is more of a filter bubble issues in CNN, NYTimes, WashingtonPost, Foxnews, etc than in social media. When nearly 100% of the largest media organizations are endorsing one candidate and/or espousing one type of ideology, maybe we should be looking at that.","> Or you can believe a story about \"elites\" and \"biased media\".","It's not a matter of believing. It's a matter of fact. Foxnews and the right wing were also whining about social media when obama won. Now it's the media and the left wing whining about social media because trump won. The only difference is that the leftwing has a much greater media presence.","It's so funny how both sides are the same. When it looked like trump was losing, he was blaming foreign interference and biased media and fake news. And the media/leftwing was mocking him for being paranoid and a sore loser. Now that trump won, it's the media/leftwing whining about foreign interference and biased social media and fake news. The hypocrisy displayed by every side is rather disheartening.","2. Why is whatever Obama did relevant to this story? Do two wrongs make a right?","3. Where in the linked article does the journalist inject their own opinion? I couldn't find any instances. The opinions came from the interview subjects, and are reported by the journalist as they should be.","Isn’t harvesting data prohibited by Facebook TOS? (Not to say that people don’t still do it). Also, could you elaborate on what kind of data you get access to by doing this data harvesting versus just using Facebook targeting data that Facebook explicitly gives advertisers access to? I’m curious because fb gives a lot of targeting criteria, so I’m wondering what kinds of things this harvesting unlocks. Sentiment analysis on post language or something?","This should be the main takeaway from this article--that Facebook relies on the honor system for protecting user data.","Breaking a company's TOS isn't a crime in and of itself, and social media data has been used for political targeting for years now. Insinuating that Trump won because of a nefarious brain control operation fueled by data from a \"data breach\" is irresponsible.","They harvested personal info of people. Something against FB policy and against the law. That is why it is news.","I understand that Hacker News has been accused of turning into reddit since reddit became a thing, but when the top most comment is from a guy who didn't even bother to read the article linked, there is a very little in the way distinction between the two sites.","And do you think the so-called \"Russian influence\" and the special counsel investigation have much substance to them anyways? Everybody can see from a mile how charged everything has become in American politics. They drum up the rhetoric on this one simply because they perceive Trump as their enemy and want him down no matter what, even though their \"own\" candidate might well have done the same thing or at least very similar things.","If this incident helps protect user privacy further it would be great. However I doubt it would happen at all. Most likely they'd just take this opportunity to aim another round of barrage at Trump instead of talking any substance about the issue itself. The purpose of this reportage is political attack against Trump instead of any concern for privacy in the first place.","I agree. So why keep up this naive and demonstrably false act that 2016 was the year persuasion and behavioral psychology was put to practical use in politics to manipulate voters.","Every presidential election cycle I can remember was full of rhetoric and outright lies persuade voters. Does no one remember all of the hilariously terrible chain letters from past elections that claimed all sorts of nonsense? I just don't understand why people are running away with this idea that somehow facebook/twitter have changed the game when it comes to brainwashing people to vote conservative.","Politics is and always has been a no holds barred competition where anything goes that isn't straight up illegal. History books praise JFK for utilizing the television in 1960 to win his presidential election. I'm starting to think that if they had today's political climate he would be remembered as a manipulator rather than being savvy.","The difference is a lot of people never imagined Trump could be elected and many people for the first time are shocked to see what the other half of the country thinks. Imagining that they were manipulated by superior technology not previously available lets people hold to the idea that half the country really didn't vote for trump deep down - if only they hadn't been duped and knew what he really was.","I was directly responding to your point. You said shilling is bad. I agree. But it doesn't do your argument any favor when you use two shill sites to defend your position. Russianlago is a shill subreddit. Everyone knows this.

A quiz site getting full access is not surprising.","Once an app has any amount of access the only thing stopping them from harvesting their own clone of your data is an agreement in the ToS that you won't store PII for more than x hours.","These rules are like the bare minimum to stop good actors. If you're a bad actor fb does not do a single thing to protect users from you. As evident in this report fb is also not above blaming the users for the hostile environment fb created and placed them in.","There must be countless copies of harvested fb data out there. My employer at the time once realized we were accidentally storing some PII permanently in a derived field. If good actors can't even keep above the law what do you think the ecosystem looks like in the shadows?","IMO we aren't having the right conversation with fb over how they mistreat our PII and we should loosen the definition of that term when companies like the one in the article can infer our political preferences from the innocuous bits of our lives we tag on facebook.","We should be asking why even an authorized API that can't stop you from copying the data doesn't count as a systemetized data breach.","It's one thing to use the friend graph to show in your app who else uses it. That's pretty legit. The other use case is to store it to some database and keep it there.","FB provides since ~10 years widgets for showing who else is liking xy. I know these Social Widgets are not so customizable and thus not pretty enough to match some custom design but at least they provide some safety nets.","Maybe Facebook could just provide more Social Widgets/CSS customizability instead of letting people write their own \"Facebook Extensions\".","I'm not sure how we draw the line. But it should at least feel ethically itchy if ppl can use data you collected to statistically infer things normally considered private information.","This puts Google on the wrong side of the line, wherever it is, next to other big offenders - fb, twitter, linkedin.","To waffle less, I would absolutely be very cautious with who you give access to your gcal. You can tell a lot about a person knowing their schedule, who they meet with, where they meet, when they fly, etc. Lots on a calendar","I was curious how the figure leaped from the 270k cited in the Facebook press release to this 50M figure.","It sounds like they never had full access to the Facebook profiles beyond the 270k who installed the app, but just harvested the friend lists of those 270k. This doesn't give the app developer full access to the friends' profile data, but I guess once you have the network of friend connections you can use other public data sources to fill in or infer the gaps. And of course some of those 50M will have FB profiles that are fully public open books ready for anyone to harvest.","I will say as someone who has developed Facebook apps, the whole ecosystem is pretty much on the honor system for protecting user data. There are some seemingly random and capricious (and often erroneous) abuse detection algorithms, but once an app has access to user data who knows what they do with it and whether it was kept secure -- surely Facebook has no idea unless they perform invasive manual physical audits.","You could get access to the full friends‘ user profile data in Graph API earlier than v2.0. If you had 500 friends, and granted friends_* OAuth permissions to an app, the app had access to 501 user profiles.","I can confirm this, at least generally. Given access by a user, you had access to all the data the user could access, including the user’s friends’. There may have been exceptions, but, for example, friends’ likes were accessible.","From the very beginning there has been a rule that you were not allowed to persist data more than a few days in your own dB. But it was obvious there was no way for fb to verify what you did or did not keep.","There has never been substantial control on profile data harvest on fb. It was whatever you could get users to okay, which was a lot given the value your app had to appear to provide.","A substantial percentage of the US population installed that \"cow clicker\" app at some point, and who knows what data they harvested. Even if they did not access your full profile, they could probably learn a lot about you based on when and how often you were clicking on cows.","From the interview, the architect of the system says Facebook detected the download of data (50 million users' data might crush smaller companies.) and asked what was going on and he just told them it was for academic purposes so Facebook let it pass. Also when Facebook told them to delete it later, CA said they did but didn't.","Minor point of confusion -- this article refers multiple times to a \"data breach\". (\"...one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data...\", \"At the time of the data breach...\", \"...first reported the breach...\")","As far as I can tell, there is no data breach, right? It sounds like CA got facebook data through an app they wrote, thisisyourdigitallife, which did some shady things.","Also, \"The New York Times is reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online\".","Basically FB gave the data away. Apps have access to the data but they're not allowed to give/sell it to third parties. In this case the rules were ignored. Probably many other companies with API access have also ignored the rules. In this case FB didn't make much of an effort at all to prevent it from happening so it's reasonable to assume the practice is rampant. There's likely many copies of large parts of FB data out there (left on laptops on trains or on unprotected FTP/HTTP servers, etc.).","One thing other commenters haven't mentioned is that Facebook asked the other parties to delete the data and promise never to use it again and the other parties even certified that they had done so, but the whistleblower is alleging they lied to Facebook.","OK, this feels like it will bring about the end. Of something. Facebook? Massive use of data for political campaigns? Anything?","If we keep consuming news like this, and do nothing, it's going to scalate massively. Same way as when Snowden told people they were spyed on and they collectively shrugged and continued with their lives as if nothing had happened.","We, people in tech, have a massive moral burden to educate 'normals' on the meaning of news like this!","To a certain degree, this is a problem that Facebook has already taken steps against in the last years.","Remember that Facebook gives you zero access to users’ data just for being an advertiser. This scheme relied on users granting access to an app.","Data access by apps was curtailed two or three years ago to no longer include friends’ data. The permissions dialog has also become far more granular. From my observation, apps seem to mostly respect facebook’s rules on data scarcity, i. e. asking only for the data they actually need.","GDPR will enshrine this principle in law at least for European citizen, and it’s somewhat likely that it will have some effect far beyond the borders of Europe.","Regarding elections, first steps will likely align the law with that for TV advertisement. Clear information about an ad’s sponsor should be required, as well as the selectors used to target you. I’ve also heard some chatter about requiring a public repository for all ads. Right now, there might be waves of, for example, racists ads that never get reported in the news because the targeting never hits those people that would consider the ad problematic. The Atlantic is running a pilot program with a chrome extensions that records all advertisement you see on Facebook for such a repository.","In the current political climate, it’s unfortunately unlikely that the US will lead with new regulation. But there are a few decent agencies in the US that can squeeze a lot of mileage out of laws already on the books (the special prosecutor, and even the FEC). Social media companies are also quite scared, both because they fear a hit to their business, and because most of their excecutive do retain some humanity. You can also expect individual European companies to get out the big guns, seeing Trump and other Russia-backed populists rattling the core of the current consensus on liberal, open, civil societies.","> Remember that Facebook gives you zero access to users’ data just for being an advertiser.","As an advertiser you can target users based on very specific details, and track any user that responds to your advertisement campaign.","You get all the access (AKA, you know which part of your customer base resulted from targeted ad campaigns, so anything you can target on, you can attribute to that subset).","Regarding elections and digital platforms, a Dutch policy advisory states that the government should disallow non-transparent political advertisements (all advertisements should clearly state who sponsored them and to promote which political cause, if any), and to ensure that political parties can not hide their trade-offs, they shouldn't be able to micro-target people with a different message (increase taxes vs. decrease taxes, depending on what makes the user more likely to vote for you).","We are on a technical forum, thus I expect you to come up with a technical description on how can I use fb ads targeting to find out who is white and likes Arsenal in my neighborhood.","Arguing that only some advertisers get access to the tools required is bullshit: this is saying that Facebook won't tell you directly who is such and such, but will give you access to tools to bypass their own rules. I hope you see how idiotic arguing for such a case is.","The IETF's BCP#188 document is one of many consequences of Snowden, its title is \"Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack\", and the text begins \"Pervasive monitoring is a technical attack that should be mitigated in the design of IETF protocols, where possible\".","Almost literally right now, IETF 101 is starting in London, and one of the things presented will be a series of proposals by people who claim they (or organisations they work for, the IETF is only for people, corporations can't participate they can just send people to it) have a legitimate reason to snoop on TLS traffic. TLS 1.3 is designed, following BCP#188, to make such snooping impossible without ongoing assistance from one of the endpoints (if the endpoint is co-operating with the snooping there's mathematically nothing anybody can do) and they would dearly like to return to an era when they could snoop with just a little one time assistance. Now, maybe this would have been stiffly resisted anyway, but BCP#188 means anybody who isn't sure has an existing IETF document telling them exactly why this is a terrible idea.","The first Ad Sales pitch deck for TheFacebook.com included a slide showing how advertisers can target students based on their sexual orientation, political bend, dating interests, gender, age, education, and social graph. All of which can be used to discriminate based on protected variables, like gender, sexuality, age, mental disability, and race.","This will not be the end, and has been like this from the very beginning. If foreign companies can get access to this information, then intelligence agencies certainly can too.","The problem is that regular people no longer have a place to communicate. It used to be that the workplace, church, neighborhood or union meetings were the place to socialize and discuss these issues and take collective action. Now we have nowhere to turn to. Modern nomadic culture alongside temporary jobs, low trust and personalized news all make sure that we cannot take collective action on anything.","We need to find a new way to communicate before this cancer becomes so widespread that the last bastillions are lost.","> It used to be that the workplace, church, neighborhood or union meetings were the place to socialize and discuss these issues and take collective action","People still socialize and discuss issues in the real world. Having a Facebook group for a church or neighborhood doesn't preclude anyone from going to church or physically interacting with their neighbors. People also still take collective action in the real world - Antifa, BLM and the Tea Party are three modern examples, but there are countless others which simply don't get media attention.","And, all else aside, social media is still perfectly adequate for enabling communication between most people.","I'm sorry, but your comment seems more rooted in hyperbole than reality.","It was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use. And although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling data on, or putting it to other purposes, – including Cambridge Analytica’s political marketing – was strictly barred.","It also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another.","Technically perhaps correct, but for the victims it seems rather irrelevant to me.","In a data breach, someone would have used a technical vulnerability or some other (e.g. social engineering) vulnerability of Facebook to get illegitimate access to the data.","In this case Facebook simply gave them access to the data and took their word that they won't misuse it.","Now maybe the latter situation might not be a data breach in the classical sense, but I don't see how it makes it any better for the victims. If anything it seems worse -- Facebook didn't even try to protect their data.","Facebook isn't the victim here, it's voters who may have been specifically targeted at a \"physchographic\" level and had their opinions unduly influenced. Further, every person who's a member of a democracy that was targeted by Cambridge Anayltica and is now being run by corrupted politicians (or in the case of Brexit by misinformed voters) is a victim.","Nobody’s saying FB’s the victim. It’s their fault, if anything. People are „unduly” influenced all the time, and by everybody. Saying CA somehow worse than anybody else just because they worked for people you don’t like is disingenuous. It’s FB that should be held accountable here; they gave away people’s personal data to a third party.","Don't you think that it can be a breach in the same sense of a breach by phishing? After all, both of the cases are about people giving their \"secrets\" for one reason but the info being used for something else.","I mean, in the case of traditional phishing the user is tricked to provide the password by impersonating a banking site, getting their funds stolen and in the case in question, the users are tricked to provide personal information by being promised some kind of personality analysis but their data is used for political propaganda that they didn't asked for resulting in life-changing consequences du to politics.","Right. They basically just made an app on FB then had users accept the permissions. The horribly beautiful thing about FB permissions is that almost every single app will request EVERYTHING, and if you deny even a single permission that the app doesn't even seem to need, then the app will break or won't let you use it. So every user is indoctrinated into just clicking accept regardless of the supposed \"granular\" permissions. They are granular as in granulated sand, falls right through your fingers.","However in this situation we are talking about 3rd parties having an all or nothing policy on your data. If you don’t let some apps you login with Facebook have access to everything you can’t use their app.","...and have everyone else who knows you stop, and block their widgets and buttons that track you, and block any org that might leak, sell, or just share some of your info with them. I can’t stop a friend or just some rando at a party from uploading a photo of me. I can’t stop friends from using FB and getting me into their system. In 2018, privacy isn’t just about what we choose to do.","I agree. But you should take that first step, and then start lobbying your friends to stop posting pictures of you. Personally, I also excuse myself at gatherings when the cameras come out, because I know it's all going straight to FB. The shaming has already started to decrease; now I'm usually not alone in popping out of the room.","That is a great idea.\nPersonally I have tried to serve bad data to google captchas for many years. The text capthas were really easy, but the newer image captchas are much more obstinate. Or maybe my shadow profile just got tagged as an unreliable captcha form-filler.","Smart, I think I’d have more success trying this than just leaving the situation entirely. This is going to be a lot easier to pull off with non tech oriented friends than a speech about privacy and why I have to leave the room.","I would be seriously impressed and surprised if they managed to get any information based on photos uploaded that happened to include people who weren't tagged and weren't on Facebook. Aside from the all-or-nothing nature of specific apps, privacy is more about what you choose to do than that - most people just choose to not do much for privacy. At least as far as most private corporations using the Internet goes.","Possibly, but remember it starts with the user authorizing a company (FB) to release his/her data to a third-party. If the user doesn't trust the third-party then it shouldn't authorize the data sharing. The question I guess is that FB then agrees to share the data under certain conditions (that the third party only uses the data for an agreed purpose), and if this agreement between FB and the third party isn't honoured, shouldn't FB then sue for damages on behalf of the user?","You are nitpicking a small part of an article (incorrectly) and it distracts from the main point: A foreign power is working with American billionaires to subvert democracy and install a dictator.

But this article made it click: all you can really do to monetise or use millions of profiles of Facebook users is target them with ads, and Facebook is the only place you can target those ads effectively given Facebook user data, and the more data you have the more effective those ads are, the more you pay Facebook.","Facebook don't sell user data, they've long said that - and it's true. They sell the ability to target advertising to their users, and you can do that a whole lot better if you have their user data.

You get a stupid quiz or photo frame in exchange for a copy of your friends list.

The one I saw on TV was that guy with Hillary in a cage in parades - he was paid by Russians to make it. I also remember reading about the pro and anti gun rallies at that Texas state park - the Russians made the Facebook page for both sides in that little incident.\nhttps://mashable.com/2018/02/16/indictment-russian-trolls-in...","Presumably Mueller used that subpoena on Facebook and internet providers and the Russians didn't try to hide very hard and used mostly Russian ip addresses.","There's also the fact Facebook admitted it sold ads and post promotion to Russian agencies and told Congress the reach of those ads and posts. Recently Facebook revealed to all users in North America whether or not they had interacted with those ads/posts. Several news organizations have independently found the data from other sources including actual interviews with the people working in Russia.","I've heard all sorts of the juicy details, it makes a great story there's no doubt. What I'm looking for is some substantial, verifiable evidence to overcome my suspicions at how perfect of a story it is, as well as some of the inconsistencies.","For example:","> Presumably Mueller used that subpoena on Facebook and internet providers and the Russians didn't try to hide very hard and used mostly Russian ip addresses.","So on one hand, article after article tells us how sophisticated these hackers are, yet these very same hackers didn't hide their ip addresses, and also openly posted links on twitter that were supportive of Russia. Doesn't something about that seem a little off to you? If it does, you'll be the first person I've encountered who think it does, everyone else is completely confident that this is an open and shut case. Yet, none of these same people can point to any specific evidence that could convince me. Sure, everyone has some articles full of juicy stories, usually containing confident statements from high ranking government officials assuring us crimes have been committed and they have proof, but I've never been able to find a person who could point me directly to any proof.","This feels a bit like some things we've experienced in the past, where the \"facts\" about an enemy, that we're are assured are 100% completely true and verified, trust us turn out to not be true several years down the road. But by then, we've already spent trillions of dollars and waged a war killing thousands of innocent people.","I'd rather not go down that path again, so I'm sorry if I can't join in the party vilifying the evil Russians, because based on the information I have so far, it seems like classic misdirection with the primary beneficiary once again being military budgets, and everyone is just a bit too enthusiastic to believe anything they're told.","EDIT: There is no shortage of internet downvotes for people like me who aren't willing to go along with this story, but there is a severe shortage of people who will put me in my place with actual content. You can probably imagine the effect this might have on the certainty I feel in the correctness of my stance. Unlike others, I'm open to having my mind change, but for some reason no one can muster any effort beyond a condescending and intellectually lazy \"let me google that for you\".","They have some of the Russians who worked for the RIA interviewed for newspapers and admitting what they did, which kind of blew my mind. I guess one could claim those were faked, like the moon landing conspiracy theorists.","From your own example which I presume is about the Iraq war, there is nothing that an ordinary citizen can do to prove that powers in the US, UK, and Kuwaiti governments (and Iraqi agents working in favor of an attack on Iraq) falsified the evidence they presented to the public for a compelling argument for invading Iraq without relying on sources that cannot be verified by an ordinary citizen without access to the journalists/non proliferation experts/government agents responsible and nothing an ordinary citizen can do to prove US claims that Iraq had an active WMD program and mistreated Kuwaiti babies as claimed at the time (by what we know now was a state actor who lied for Kuwait) in congressional testimony after the Iraq invasion of Kuwait. Even the New York Times and that one reporter famously lied flat out about Iraqi weapons programs and abuses in the build up to the war. But there were plenty of people who were investigating the claims of Iraqi WMD who said there was nothing there and that led to a lot of people protesting against the war. I don't see any investigators for the FBI or NSA coming out and being a whistle blower and saying this Russian thing is faked, on the contrary, the only whistle blower who came out so far, actually showed the internal NSA documents that said the USA elections was under cyberattack by Russia. The most reputable guy who came out for the Iraq WMD was possibly Colin Powell. Less well know is that he was also the first US Army investigator who looked into the My Lai massacre and he found that nothing was done wrong, so he was kind of used to this type of thing by then. It took a second Army investigator to reveal what happened there.","Or more contemporaneously there is nothing a citizen can do to prove that the recent Russian spy who was released to the UK and attacked was poisoned with a Russian only sourced nerve agent. And if it was the Russian nerve agent (that the Russians offically proclaimed to have destroyed all stockpiles of), there's no way for a citizen to prove it was Russian government behind it or that some other power was responsible for usage of it.\nI didn't vote either way on your comment, it just seems like an impossible standard.","I honestly don't think wanting to see verifiable evidence before forming a decisive opinion on something is anything near an impossible standard, especially since as you've noted, our governments and newspapers are known to lie to citizens. Anyone who's done any reading on the topic outside of the mainstream knows what you see on TV in the west is a slanted version of the truth at best. And yet, look how absolutely certain people are about their beliefs, but when asked to provide some of the hard-factual content they read to form this rock solid opinion, almost no one has anything other than a downvote. To me, this looks like some sort of a classic mania, and it's quite concerning.","As they should, but I read another Authoritative Proof that many people assured me I should take Very Seriously that used the posting of pro-Russian propaganda as the proof that Twitter bots that interfered with the election were Russian.","I don't doubt at all that there is a government sponsored organization in Russia that promotes Russian interests via cyber operations, as I'm sure there is in the United States. I'm looking for proof that:","a) this isn't a 3rd party posing as Russians","b) The harm or danger of this meddling is proportional to the airtime and Very Serious Tones of Voice we've been subjected to 24x7 for the last year.","Do you know of any compelling (and verifiable by a civilian) evidence that could help me with that?","How much reading are you willing to make time for? I've collected a very large number of links to source, research, & analysis material on Russia's ongoing active measures campaign over the last 14 months (though ironically, I still haven't gotten around to reading the recent indictment). This is a complex issue, and my perception is that a full proof of all the claims alleged about Russia's operation will require much more detail and logical inferences than most people who keep harping about \"where's the proof? where's the smoking gun?\" really expect. But if you want to keep the scope limited to just your a) and b), then I can probably dig up some compelling and hopefully verifiable public evidence in support of them (at least in support of your point a - for b, the only people who have metrics & data on how effective and impactful this operation has been on our country are probably the IRA, Russian intelligence services, and Cambridge Analytica. So point b is tougher for me, but I could at least point you to proof of the dark seriousness of their intent and goals). It might still be a lot of material to go over, though. Fair warning.","a) Feel free to read the indictment, some detail there. I assume there will be far more at a later point.","b) I have no idea what effect it had. I personally am not sure it did have any effect that made a difference. Coverage is still warranted because attacks from foreign nations are newsworthy regardless of success."],"isopubdate":""}

With 'oversight' like that, Mr Obama's credibility is now under scrutiny like never before."],"isopubdate":"2013-06-07"}

But it looks like this is easier said than done. No sooner is Facebook coming to terms with one issue, there is another one waiting at the door to creep on to the collective conscience of its users. And this has been happening so regularly of late, that one has been left numb to an extent.","A 3D plastic representation of the Facebook logo. Reuters.","The most recent of the thorns in Facebook’s crown is courtesy the alleged misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica. Last Friday, Facebook suspended Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica after it emerged that it was using data shared by a developer who was supposed to use it only for his own app.","According to Facebook, “In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.”","While one may have thought that this was pro-active action by Facebook — despite it being three years too late — it was only on the following day that the reason behind the suspension of SCL became amply clear. Turns out news media organisations such as The Guardian and New York Timeshad a story which would blow the lid of the data analytics firm methods and this could have had a hand in assisting with Donald Trump’s victory, by manipulating voter behaviour.","So let’s see how this latest controversy has played out so far.","What’s Cambridge Analytica and why is it in the news?","Cambridge Analytica (CA) is a UK-based data analytics firm with its parent company named Strategic Communications Laboratories. The purpose of CA is to come up with online political campaigns, reach out to potential voters online and it does this by combining data from multiple sources including online information.","It is also the firm that worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign as well as with the Leave EU camp during Brexit. One of its co-founders and data analysts at Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie shared evidence about the company having harvested data from close to 50 million users on Facebook. This was done without the express permission of the said users. CA then used this information to create a psychological profile of the users as well as their friends based on their online activities. This was then used for targetted political advertising during UK’s Brexit referendum as well as during the 2016 US presidential elections.","Cambridge Analytica logo","CA is said to have got this private data from Cambridge researcher Alexsandr Kogan, who created an app called ‘thisisyourdigitallife’ to offer personality predictions online. Now, Facebook lets app developers seek permissions from users to use their personal data to help develop the app. In this particular case, Kogan’s app offered users a personality prediction after they agreed to take a personality test. Around 270,000 people downloaded the app. They gave their consent to Kogan to access their public information as well as limited information about their friends. Now while Kogan got access to this data, it was only meant to be used by him for developing his app. Instead, Kogan went ahead and sold this data to CA, which then used it to tweak their social strategies for the Trump election campaigns.","To give an idea, say if you had downloaded this app and taken the personality quiz, Kogan’s app was able to determine your race, gender, sexual orientation, which political party you were most likely to vote for, and even predicting your vulnerability to substance abuse. That is quite specific information and something that most of us don’t publicly share. Yet, this is the kind of deductions Kogan’s app was able to make after you downloaded the app and answered a few queries.","CA also got funding from US billionaire Robert Mercer, who is also a major investor in alt-right website Breitbart News. And Steve Bannon, who served as a chief strategist in the first seven months of Trump administration and a founding member of Breitbart News was also theadvisor to CA for a while.","Who is Christopher Wylie and what are his allegations?","Christopher Wylie. Image: twitter/@chrisinsilico","Christopher Wylie is the co-founder and former research lead at Cambridge Analytica, who blew the whistle on CA’s unethical activities. Speaking to The Guardian, Wylie said that the company exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles and used that to build models to target these same people.","According to Wylie, Facebook suspended his account for his act of blowing the whistle on something that Facebook knew privately for about two years.","Explaining the process to Channel 4 News, Wylie said that Kogan’s app paid thousands of users (a lot of them hired by CA using Amazon’s Mechanical Turks platform) a small amount of money to take an online personality quiz after they downloaded the app. While downloading the app users gave consent for Kogan’s app to use their personal data, location and some publicly available data of your friends as well (this feature of accessing friends’ data was discontinued in 2015). Then using the source code from the responses Kogan’s app got, it was fed into an algorithm which would create a user psychological profile of the user. On an average, for every user survey, Kogan’s app captured records of up to 300 Facebook users.","“I just need to engage 70,000 to 100,000 people to get a really big data set, really quickly. This method scaled very quickly and we were able to get upwards of 50 million plus Facebook records within a span of a couple of months,” said Wylie saying that almost none of those 50 million users were aware that their data was being used.","File image of Steve Bannon. AP","Wylie spoke about how the Trump campaign used the data to create sort of culture war. “Steve (Bannon) wanted weapons for his culture war and we offered him a way to accomplish what he wanted to do, which was to change the culture of America,” said Wylie.","What are Cambridge Analytica’s responses?","CA responded to Facebook’s suspension order by stating that it does not hold data from Facebook profiles. CA acknowledged that it had contracted a company, Global Science Research (GSR) (which was founded by Kogan), for a large-scale research project. According to CA, GSR was only to obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and after seeking user consent.","“GSR obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR. No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,” says CA.","U.S. President Donald Trump/ AP","What’s Facebook’s response?","According to Facebook, there is no data breach as the users who had downloaded the app made by Kogan, did so of their own accord.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” said Facebook. On the topic of the data of friends also being compromised, Facebook’s ‘platform policy’ allows only the collection of friends’ data to improve the in-app user experience and this data is not meant to be sold outside. For now, Facebook has suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Dr Alexsandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie, till further investigations.","In what can be construed as a self-goal, Facebook even threatened The Guardian with a legal noticeagainst publishing the report, calling it ‘false and defamatory’ allegations.","Facebook’s arguments denying the ‘data breach’ have a similar tone of the UIDAI denying any issues with Aadhaar security despite the many data vulnerabilities.","How is it related to the Trump election campaign?","CA was hired by the Trump campaign to help with data crunching during the 2016 election season. Steve Bannon, then chairman of Breitbart News, who eventually became an advisor to Trump, was also said to be the vice president of CA’s board. CA guided Trump’s campaign team on how best to target voters using ads or speeches or making the strategic campaign stops. While this may look like any other service persuading voters to vote for their party, according to Wiley what CA did was manipulating voters into voting for Trump.","Who is Facebook answerable to now?","Facebook is already facing the music in the US with regards to the involvement of Russian entities in gaming Facebook’s ad platform. This revelation can only make things worse for Facebook. Even though Facebook says that there isn’t a data breach, because users who downloaded Kogan’s app did so of their own volition, the friends of these users who may not have interacted with the app had to let go of their data unknowingly.","Britain’s information commissioner is investigating whether Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used,” after it suspended CA. In the US, several Republican lawmakers have expressed serious concerns over privacy violations after this story broke out.","File photo of Mark Zuckerberg. Reuters","Republican Senator Jeff Flake said he had a lot of questions about the data taken from Facebook, including who knew it had been taken and whether it is still being used.","“This is a big deal when you have that amount of data, and the privacy violations there are significant,” he told CNN’s State of the Union program. “So the question is who knew it and when did they know it, how long did this go on and what happens to that data now.”","Facebook faced new calls for regulation from Democratic senators on 17 March and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards, but it was unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress would act.","Cambridge Analytica eyeing India","According to a report in Hindustan Times, the UK-based firm has its eyes on South-Asian countries such as India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as they approach elections. The report states that CA and its India partner Oveleno Business Intelligence (OBI) have reached out to Congress and BJP for a possible collaboration for the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha elections.","According to OBI CEO, Amrish Tyagi, the company is in talks with CA which has denied the allegations and is looking at legal measures. “We are partners. If something is established to be in violation of Indian law, then we will, of course, reconsider it,” said Tyagi. So far according to Tyagi, CA has no projects in India so there is no question of them having done any social media work here.","What happens now?","We can rest assured that this matter will be in the news cycle for quite a while. The extent of the data breach is still not fully known. Whether Facebook and Cambridge Analytica will take the legal route is something that only time will tell. As for your personal data, as is evident from Wylie’s confession, even if you may not have downloaded and used the ‘thisisyourdigitallife’ app, if you were friends with someone who had and hadn’t really set your privacy settings, then your personal data is most surely part of the sweep.","As it is, Facebook and a lot of social media websites have been facing the music from governments especially in the US, the UK as well as the EU. This data breach will only strengthen the voices of critics who are asking for more regulation of social media.","As for Wylie, he could be sued by CA or Bannon for breaking any confidentiality agreements they may have had."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

All parties involved — including the SCL Group/Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie and Aleksandr Kogan - certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.

We now have a deluge of social media information that can give analysts a colossal archive of our \"likes,\" language, friend networks, and history to play with.","\"Psychometrics by itself is not a new field,\" Sharath Guntuku, a computer science researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, told Mashable. \"What's new is using social media as a psychometric tool.\"","Guntuku uses social media information — which he gets direct consent from hospital patients to use — as part of a \"pioneering mission\" to measure psychological and physical well-being. But, as the Cambridge Analytica controversy shows, modern social media data can twist the technique in at best unethical, and at worst, deceitful and manipulative ways.","\"There’s a huge amount of data that’s ripe for abuse,\" said Luke Stark, a postdoctoral fellow at Dartmouth College's Sociology Department, in an interview.","How valuable is social media data in psychographics?","\"Social media can be very effective at predicting emotions,\" said Guntuku.","Psychometric analyses of people's social media language have proven to be quite accurate. An analysis of language alone can give researchers an accurate identification of gender 80 percent of the time, Guntuku said. Computer programs can also correctly identify someone's age within less than six years 94 percent of the time.","Language alone lets researchers predict a subject's gender 80 percent of the time","When combined with rich data about someone's feelings about provocative societal issues — like immigration, war, and gun-control — an electioneering company like Cambridge Analytica can determine whom to target with social media ads, and how. As reported by the Guardian, Politico published \"sponsor-generated content\" directly paid for by the Trump Campaign entitled \"Clinton Corruption: Ten Inconvenient Truths about the Clinton Foundation.\" This interactive infographic reportedly served as one of Cambridge Analytica's most successful 2016 election ads.","Still, social media data, while plentiful, has some limitations that can make psychographic analyses challenging. That's why psychographics are predictive, and not completely certain. Analyzing social media behavior (language in posts or \"likes\") might easily show if someone is happy or sad, \"but if you're depressed or not — it’s a more difficult question to answer,\" Guntuku said.","Some say this Facebook data, collected in 2014, wasn't that useful in predicting the personality traits of American voters, and thus gave no real advantage to the Trump campaign in swaying voters in Donald Trump's favor. But there's little reason to accept this conclusion at this point. Revelations are still coming to light, and how exactly Cambridge Analytica violated its data-sharing agreement with Facebook isn't fully known.","\"Whether or not it’s effective in changing the outcome of an election — the jury is still out,\" Stark said.","Christopher Wylie, one of the founders of Cambridge Analytica, exposed how the marketing company used data (without consent) from millions of Facebook users.","Image: Getty Images","It may never be concretely known if the Facebook data ultimately gave the Trump campaign its razor-thin edge in the Electoral College, but at minimum, it benefited them in some way.","\"You would find a way to know something,\" said James Roberts, who heads the Psychometric Research and Development Lab at Georgia Tech. \"Whatever [Cambridge Analytica was] attempting to do, it was done better with the data than without.\"","The problem arises when this data is used outside these companies, specifically for manipulation.","For instance, Cambridge Analytica might have used Facebook data to identify sentiments of a certain voter demographic, and then modeled advertisements to play into their ideologies, or to shape their perception of reality, as the company claims it could do.","People are aware that their online behavior will be used for targeted advertisements, but no one signs up for targeted manipulation. Things get even worse when people are manipulated with propaganda or \"fake news.\"","After the Cambridge Analytica scandal, will social media data be better protected?","Due to the intense backlash over Cambridge Analytica's violations, U.S. regulators like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are investigating Facebook's privacy policies, and might enforce stricter data protection rules for social media companies.","\"Incidents like this one will likely serve to drive adoption of additional regulation here in the United States, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) going into effect in E.U. nations two months from now,\" said Scott Nestler, who teaches ethics in data science and analytics at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business, via email.","The GDPR requires that people be given clearer ideas of what they're consenting to and that their data is anonymized in case it gets out — as data in the digital age is wont to do.","Whatever comes of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the results certainly won't mean an end to psychographic data being used to model our psyche — at a minimum for sales purposes. Long before Mark Zuckerberg was born, companies employed metrics to determine what Americans want. But now, this data is more detailed and abundant than ever, and its applications are growing. It's not going away, so at a minimum, it should be better protected.","\"Facebook data around personality needs to be considered as sensitive as other medical data,\" Stark said.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

And it does so with a harsh language, indicating that it will be \"firm\" and that it is \"fully committed\" to using all the tools it has in its power to protect the privacy of users.","The coup was immediate for the social network, which lost 6% of its stock market value after the official statement made by the acting director Tom Pahl. The official's assertion implies that Facebook faces sanctions for \"missing its promises\" on privacy or if it is determined that its actions caused \"substantial harm\" to consumers by violating the rules of the game.","The FTC has already indicated Last week he is aware of the problems that emerged as a result of the data leakage scandal at the Cambridge Analytica policy consultancy. The test tries to determine if the social network is violating with its practices the consent that users give when handling personal data for commercial purposes and to what extent the controversial analysis firm was allowed access to that information. [19659002] It is not the first time that Facebook deals with privacy issues. The social network owes its business to the data it sells to advertisers, so that they can direct their product to the consumer. The FTC entered into a pact with the dotcom in November 2011, after admitting that it deceived consumers by telling them that it protected their information when in fact they were sharing it without informing them. Then he avoided the reprimand of $ 40,000 per day during the period of the violation.","\"Companies that agreed to previous actions with the FTC must comply with the provisions of the orders imposed on privacy and requirements on data security,\" recalls Pahl. . The agency insists that the published information about Facebook practices is \"taken very seriously\". If you finally determine that your users were missing, you can sanction it as you did with Google in August 2012.","Facebook has been under criticism for more than a year as a result of the abuses that the platform allowed with the dissemination of false news and advertisements politicians paid for accounts operated from Russia during the 2016 elections. The damage of the last scandal can be huge if users stop trusting the social network and advertisers abandon it, which explains the collapse of its quotation.","social network lost 23% of its value if you take as reference the 195 dollars that were paid at the beginning of February for each title, its last maximum. Facebook currently has a stock market capitalization of around 460,000 million dollars (370,000 million dollars). The FTC's response not only implies that there will be a sanction for violating the pact six years ago, it also puts more pressure on the eventual testimony of Mark Zuckerberg in Congress.","The chairman of the Senate's legal committee, Charles Grassley, has already received the official invitation for the founder of Facebook to appear at a hearing scheduled for next April 10 dedicated to discussing the future of data protection and discussing the rules that may be adopted.

The harvesting was reportedly carried out\nin 2014 by Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer in psychology at the University\nof Cambridge, using a Facebook app, which was downloaded by about three\nhundred thousand users. At the time, Facebook’s data-sharing policies\nwere far more permissive than they are now: simply by authorizing an\napp, users could give developers access not only to their own data—photos, work histories, birthdays,\nreligious and political affiliations—but\nalso to the data of all their friends.","Facebook has bristled at the suggestion that what Kogan and Cambridge\nAnalytica did constitutes a breach. “People knowingly provided their\ninformation, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive\npieces of information were stolen or hacked,” Paul Grewal, the company’s\ndeputy counsel, stated last\nSaturday.\nBut the furor has continued, amid reports that Stephen Bannon, the\nformer chief strategist of Trump’s campaign, oversaw the collection of\nthe\ndata and used it to craft messaging for Trump’s Presidential bid. On\nWednesday, Facebook’s C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, addressed the\n“Cambridge Analytica\nsituation” in a\npost, writing, “We will learn from this experience to secure our\nplatform further and make our community safer for everyone going\nforward.”","It wasn’t Zuckerberg’s first mea culpa. In the past eighteen months,\nthanks in no small part to Trump’s victory, he and other Silicon Valley\nleaders have been forced to reckon with the sometimes negative\nrole that their companies play in Americans’ lives—fake news, ideological\necho chambers, Russian bots. Now Facebook and the public face two\ncrucial questions: How did we get here? And can the platform be fixed?","We asked a handful of writers who have covered technology for The New\nYorker—Adrian\nChen, Nathan\nHeller, Andrew\nMarantz, and\nAnna Wiener—to\ndiscuss these questions over e-mail and suggest something like a way\nforward. We began with Zuckerberg’s recent post. The participants’\nremarks have been edited for length and clarity.","Adrian Chen: Zuckerberg’s apology jumps between two distinct\nissues—one technical, one human—in a way that gives me whiplash. The\nfirst issue he lays out and shuts down with aplomb. He explains that, in\n2014, Facebook made it so that third-party apps like Kogan’s could\nharvest the data of users’ friends only if those friends also opted into\nthe app. If that were the only problem, then this would be an\nopen-and-shut case. Alas, there’s also the human problem—the problem of\nshady developers. The only thing that Zuckerberg offers here is harm\nreduction. Going forward, he writes, Facebook will “require developers\nto not only get approval but also sign a contract in order to ask anyone\nfor access to their posts or other private data.” Of course, Cambridge\nAnalytica formally certified to Facebook that it had destroyed the data\nfrom Kogan’s app, then, according to the Times report, may have failed\nto do so. The larger problem, though, is that the winding path the data\ntook, from Facebook to Kogan to Cambridge Analytica, suggests that\nprotecting users’ information once it is in the developer ecosystem is\nincredibly difficult. You get a real\nputting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle feeling.","Maybe Zuckerberg hopes that, by laying out this narrative, he’ll offer a\npicture of a technical loophole that has already been closed. But the\nhuman vulnerability is as present as ever. The only good news, it seems,\nis that it will be a little less violating next time.","Anna Wiener: That statement! There’s so much going on there, and\nalso not that much at all. It reads to me like a postmortem for a\nsoftware project, run through the communications and legal departments.\nIt’s a gesture at transparency, but it’s very slippery.","Adrian, I think you’re exactly right that this is both a technical\nproblem and a human problem, and that Zuckerberg is pushing the\nnarrative of bad actors who exploited a loophole. But if we can call it\na loophole at all, then it’s a policy loophole: Facebook was operating\nexactly as it was intended to. It was and is an ad network. The scope of\nthe metadata that developers could harvest (and retain) probably isn’t\nsurprising to anyone who has worked in ad tech, or at any tech company,\nreally. Facebook trusted developers to do the right thing, and I think\nthis reliance on good faith—a phrase that gets a lot of exercise in the\ntech industry—tracks with a sort of tech-first, developer-is-king\nmind-set.","In some ways, this trust in developers is a product of carelessness, but\nit’s also a product of a lack of imagination: it rests on the assumption\nthat what begins as a technical endeavor remains a technical endeavor.\nIt also speaks to a greater tension in the industry, I think, between\ntechnical interests (what’s exciting, new, useful for developers) and\nthe social impact of these products. I don’t know how software is built\nat Facebook, but I imagine that the engineering team working on the\nGraph A.P.I., a developer tool that enables interaction with the\nplatform’s user relationships, probably wasn’t considering the ways in\nwhich metadata could be exploited. It’s not necessarily their job to\nhypothesize about developers who might create, say, fifteen apps, then\ncorrelate the data sets in order to build out comprehensive user\nprofiles. That said, maybe it should be the job of the\nproduct-management team. I don’t mean to lean too heavily on conjecture;\nFacebook is a black box, and it’s nearly impossible to know the\ncompany’s internal politics.","In any case, the underlying issues aren’t specific to Facebook. The\nquestion of good faith is an industry-wide problem. Data retention is an\nindustry-wide problem. Transparency is touted as a virtue in Silicon\nValley, but when it comes to the end user, transparency is still treated\nas more of a privilege than a right.","Andrew Marantz: To Adrian’s point: harm reduction is better than\nnothing. I’m all for harm reduction. And yet I agree with both of you\nthat the human problem isn’t going away, because the human problem is:\nhumans. We’ll eventually have driverless cars, even if a few pedestrians\nget killed in the process; we’ll eventually have bankless currency,\nwhether it drives the banks out of business or not; but we’ll never have\npersonless social media. (Or, if we do, it won’t be profitable for long;\nadvertisers can’t sell widgets to scripts and bots.)","Zuckerberg, in his recent apology mini-tour, left behind a lot of tea\nleaves. The statement that most piqued my interest was this one, from\nhis interview on\nCNN:\n“For most of the last ten years, this idea that the world should be more\nconnected was not very controversial. And now I think that there are\nstarting to be some people that question whether that is good.” As I\nnoted in a recent piece about\nReddit,\nFacebook’s mission, for most of its lifespan, was to “make the world\nmore open and connected.” (That changed\nslightly last\nJune.) Underlying the mission was a tacit assumption about human\nnature—that people are basically trustworthy and, therefore, that a more\nopen and connected world will naturally, perhaps automatically, become a\nbetter one. Now Zuckerberg is prepared to make that assumption explicit\nand to admit that “some people” are starting to lose faith in it. Who\nare “some people”? Is Zuckerberg one of them? Does he find them\npersuasive? I want to know more.","Are human beings essentially good? Are they, to use Adrian’s word,\nessentially shady? The fact that we can’t know the answer is, I think,\npart of the answer. When you place an enormous bet on the kindness of\nstrangers, you might be unpleasantly surprised. And you might break a\nfew democracies along the way.","Nathan Heller: Human nature, indeed. It occurs to me that a lot of\nthis slices into three big problems, and that they start to indicate\nwhat Facebook might do better going forward.","First, the trust problem. The good-faith presumption you were\npinpointing, Anna, obviously can’t hold in the eyes of users. There have\nbeen repeated\nissues.\nIt doesn’t help that Facebook is commercially oriented—and that few\nusers understand what, data-wise, goes on under its hood. Say the\ntransmission goes out on your car, and you take it to your mechanic, and\nthe mechanic says, “Christ! Let’s get this fixed,” and spends a few days\nwith it. Then, three months later, the transmission goes out again, and\nthe mechanic says, “Christ! Let’s get this fixed,” and you pay for the\nrepair again. And then it happens a third time! You would not be crazy\nto suspect that your mechanic is profiting from oversight. How can the\nmechanic win back your trust? Well, maybe the third repair is free.\nShould Facebook consider a step plainly against its commercial\ninterests, as a show of good faith?","Second, the culture problem. As you suggest, Andrew, since people can be\ntrustworthy and shady, both possibilities should probably be built into\nplanning. Recently, for a\npiece,\nI talked with some people at data-security companies, and the thing they\nkept emphasizing was that you can’t completely prevent data breaches.\nThey happen. What really matters is the response: how quickly you know\nabout them, how comprehensively and transparently you react. Our very\nbrilliant sawbones colleague Atul Gawande once gave a speech about\nsurgical\nrescue.\nIt turns out that complication rates at all hospitals are basically the\nsame, and what differs—what makes people die less in some than in\nothers—is “rescue” rates. Facebook seems to have a bad rescue culture.\nIt notices (or publicly acknowledges) major problems too late. It tries\nto do things with scrap following an explosion.","Third, the conceptual problem—and I think this really goes to the heart\nof the human-technical fuzziness you point out, Adrian. Platforms are\nalways talking about scalability, but they usually mean it only in a\nnarrow business sense. (“Social,” for them, is a structural term, not a\nhuman one.) A platform with 2.2 billion monthly active users should\nprobably be assessing scalability in some broader frame. What about\nsocietal scalability? Facebook’s year of problems suggests that it’s\nnot woo-woo to think this way; for all its cogitation, the tech world\nrarely frets about second-order societal effects, let alone third-order and\nfourth-order. What if Facebook convened a cabinet of unfriendly social\neconomists, media scholars, data historians, whatever—people who think\nsystemically in other frames—and let them kick tires and raise a fuss?\nThis strikes me as only a medium-insane idea.","Finally, I just want to say, lest I seem to run negative, that I was\nstrangely charmed by Zuckerberg’s as-a-father-of-daughters\nanswer.\nSay what you will; it’s on Zeitgeist.","Anna Wiener: Nathan, I think your point about Facebook’s commercial\norientation is really important. Facebook’s customers are not its users.\nIt’s a developer-oriented attention magnet that makes its money from\nadvertisers based on the strength of its users’ data. For Facebook to\ntruly prioritize user privacy could mean the collapse of its revenue\nengine. So when Zuckerberg says, “We have a responsibility to protect\nyour data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” it’s\nvery strange, because it assumes that Facebook’s primary orientation is\ntoward users. Zuckerberg runs a business, not a community; my\nunderstanding is that Facebook sees itself as a software company, not a\nsocial institution, and behaves accordingly. (Also, I was tripped up by\n“deserve”: Facebook is a default. Aside from Instagram, a social network\nowned by Facebook, or a revival of\nPath, users\ndon’t have much of a choice. Legislation recently passed in\nCongress is likely to compound this problem.)","To “fix” Facebook would require a decision on Facebook’s part about whom\nthe company serves. It’s now in the unenviable (if totally\nself-inflicted) position of protecting its users from its customers. If\nFacebook users could see themselves as advertisers likely do, they would\nprobably modify their sharing behaviors. Can the platform be both a\nfunctional social network and a lucrative ad network?","Andrew Marantz: Nathan asks whether Facebook might act against its\ncommercial self-interest as a show of good faith. In January, the\ncompany announced a change to its News Feed algorithm: it would,\nsomewhat ironically, show users less news, or at least less news of the\nprofessionally produced, non-personal variety. (It’s hard to tell real\nnews from fake news, and even the real news is a bummer these days.) “I\nexpect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement\nwill go down,” Zuckerberg wrote in a\npost explaining\nthe change. Translation: We’ll make less money, at least in the short\nterm. And yet, he added, “if we do the right thing, I believe that will\nbe good for our community and our business over the long term.”","So was this a show of good faith, or just a canny long-term strategy?\nDoes it go any distance, Anna, toward making Facebook seem like less of\na software company and more of a social institution? Companies are\ndesigned to make money, but the people who run them are not immune to\nsuch human motivations as shame and pride. Adam Mosseri, the head of\nNews Feed, was recently asked about Facebook’s role in exacerbating\nviolence against Myanmar’s Rohingya minority. “We lose some sleep over this,” he\nresponded. That’s believable, no?","Adrian Chen: I don’t buy the idea that whenever Facebook makes a\ndecision that lowers its revenue it is some meaningful sign of social\nresponsibility, or that it will necessarily lead to a better outcome.\nI’m thinking of how Zuckerberg, for the first years of Facebook’s\nexistence, absolutely refused to take advertising, because it might\ncorrupt the network. He lost a ton of money! The story is told all the\ntime to frame Zuckerberg as a sort of reluctant capitalist. But now he’s\nout there defending the advertising\nmodel as a way to bring Facebook to the masses. Maybe I’m too cynical, but it\nseems as though Facebook has been very good at spinning whatever design\nor business decision is most advantageous to it at the time as good for\nthe world, even as it grows bigger and more powerful, less actually accountable to the users it supposedly serves. I can’t be bothered with\nthe performance of altruism any more.","Anna Wiener: I agree with you, Adrian: there’s nothing morally\nsuperior about making product changes that lead to short-term revenue\ndips. I do want to pick up on something that Andrew brought up—Adam\nMosseri’s comment about losing sleep. I imagine that Facebook largely\nemploys smart, thoughtful people who want to do the right thing. For me,\nthe question is who, internally, is empowered to make product and policy\ndecisions. I suspect transitioning from operating primarily as a\nsoftware company to operating as a social institution would require an\naudit of the organizational DNA. In an interview yesterday, with\nRecode,\nZuckerberg addressed Facebook’s challenges around content and free\nspeech: “Things like, ‘Where’s the line on hate speech?’ I mean, who\nchose me to be the person that did that? I guess I have to, because\nwe’re here now, but I’d rather not.” I’d argue that Zuckerberg himself\ndoesn’t have to be the person making those decisions. Bring in some\nnew voices, and empower them. Cede the reins a bit. The traditional\nhierarchy of the average software company might have its limits when it\ncomes to Facebook.","Andrew Marantz: I should point out, as long as we’re talking about\ncynicism and who is empowered to make decisions within the company, that\nthe Times recently followed up on that Mosseri comment by asking\nZuckerberg\ndirectly,\n“Are you losing any sleep? Do you feel guilty about the role Facebook is\nplaying in the world?” Zuckerberg’s response was more than two hundred\nwords long, but it basically amounted to, “Nah, not really.”","Nathan Heller: “Every man’s insomnia is as different from his\nneighbor’s as are their daytime hopes and aspirations.” That’s F. Scott\nFitzgerald, from his cracked period. An emphasis may fall on the\ndifference in hope.","You make an acute point, Anna—and I certainly don’t think you’re\ncynical, Adrian. Facebook is a big company with an even bigger platform;\nit has commercial momentum and pressures presumably larger than any one\nperson’s general good intent. How do you get the apparatus on the right\nside of your supposed values? Andrew, I think this pertains to the\nJanuary News Feed change. I guess I should have said “plainly against\nits commercial interests and in support of a long-term benefit for\nusers” (who, as you point out, Anna, have had mostly sweet nothings\nwhispered in their ears so far). Surely, for users, the best solution to\nfake news isn’t less news. A show of good faith, I’d imagine, would\nrequire a deeper cut than that.","I like that we’ve landed on the phrase “social responsibility.” It seems\nlike possibly the core of our concerns. What does social responsibility\nmean for a tech giant like Facebook (but not just for Facebook)? We\nhaven’t really discussed regulatory parameters, but, in a sense,\nresponsibility parameters come first. There has been a tendency in\nSilicon Valley to think of social responsibility as something on top of\nthe platform: a mission, or a service base, or just something that you\ndo with all your cash. I wonder whether, through Facebook’s missteps,\nwe’re arriving at a reckoning with the idea that social responsibility\nis inherent in the nitty-gritty of a platform itself: how information\ntravels, how its transfer is guarded, how the platform’s algorithms are\ndesigned. That would be a very different notion than what has\ntraditionally obtained, certainly in the public eye. It’s like a social\nethics of coding. Is this a healthy, useful reckoning to come to? I’d\nsay yes."],"isopubdate":""}

Now that Facebook is losing some major profits, he’s realizing that people are expecting him to finally step up and deal with the latest scandals head on.","After trying to skirt around the question regarding him testifying before Congress, Zuckerberg has been forced into having to take on that responsibility. It’s actually something that should have come natural to him after being CEO of the company he co-founded for so long.","As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U.S. presidential election, Mark Zuckerberg’s to-do list landed him on a fishing trawler off Alabama’s Gulf coast.","But the chatter surrounding the CEO’s arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30-state personal tour: his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2.2 billion people worldwide.","“It was one of the last things I asked him, thinking it would put a smile on his face — and it did,” said Dominick Ficarino, who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, and hosted a dockside lunch for Zuckerberg that Sunday afternoon.","“I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States. And his answer to me was: ‘Can I answer you with a question? If you were me, would you?’”","Thirteen months later, Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act. Instead, he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name. It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook’s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself.","“The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do,” Zuckerberg wrote in January, laying out the “personal challenge” that he sets for himself each year.","In 2017, the billionaire challenged himself to travel to every state he’d never visited. This year, long after critics began demanding an overhaul, Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to “fix” the platform that he has engineered to build community — but that is increasingly blamed for warping it.","Yet things continue to get worse. Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users — possibly used to aid Donald Trump’s campaign — and that the social network has been collecting Android users’ phone call and text message histories without notice. That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information.","On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices.","Throughout the mounting crisis, Zuckerberg’s response has been a study in contradictions. He crisscrossed the country, even as his company back home came under increasing fire. He preaches transparency, but flinches at questioning and craves privacy. He is undeniably brilliant, but stubborn in his reluctance to acknowledge the extent of Facebook’s problems.","Even his critics say he is uniquely capable of righting the ship. But at 33, is he prepared to do all it will take?","“If he fails to do it, it may take a while, but eventually people are going to rebel,” said Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor, and adviser who has become one of the company’s most pointed critics.","“I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time,” McNamee said. “I think it’s really hard to make that case today.”","___","Days after Trump’s election, Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters.","“The idea that fake news on Facebook … influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,” the CEO told the audience at a California technology conference.","“I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was,” said David Kirkpatrick, the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day. “You can certainly say that he was culpable, in that he was naive and inattentive to what was happening in his system. But I don’t think he was lying.”","Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after, continuing a years-long routine of self-correction. But errors that reflect his stubbornness, those who know him say, are tempered by an eagerness to learn from mistakes and a deep sense of reflection.","Donald Graham, the former chairman of the Washington Post Co., recalled that when he met Zuckerberg in 2005, outsiders still weren’t sure what to make of Facebook.","“I would ask him a question, and he would pause long enough — 15 seconds, 20 seconds — that I would think ’Did I insult him? Did he not hear me?’” said Graham, who went on to serve on the company’s board from 2008 to 2015.","“Since I am from Washington, I’m not used to people thinking before they are answering a question. … But Mark, then as now, was thinking about the right answer.”","Zuckerberg’s boyish appearance, even today, is a reminder of just how young he was when he created what would become the world’s biggest social network, back in his dorm room at Harvard.","“I didn’t know anything about building a company or global internet service,” he wrote in January. “Over the years I’ve made almost every mistake you can imagine.”","Naomi Gleit, Facebook’s longest-serving employee after the CEO, said Zuckerberg — who declined an interview request from media outlets — has been talking about making the world a better place since he was 21. But his view of that world and his place in it “seemed almost like a gravity, a burden of responsibility,” she said.","That seriousness coincides with a sense of certainty.","Gleit recalled Zuckerberg’s steadfast attachment to a Facebook message service similar to email, even as more people began using phones to send text messages. But co-workers eventually swayed the CEO, whom she described as a “learn-it-all.” That change-of-mind informed Facebook’s 2014 purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service for $19 billion.","“I think he would even say now that he was initially wrong,” Gleit said.","With Zuckerberg, “it’s experiment, learn, experiment, learn,” said LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who has known him since 2004. Hoffman said that is evident in Zuckerberg’s enthusiasm for software, which can be overwritten to fix problems. That facility, he said, makes Zuckerberg the equal of executives with far more experience.","But in the process of learning, Zuckerberg’s inexperience has sometimes played out in public view.","___","In 2010, Zuckerberg announced on Oprah Winfrey’s television show that he would donate $100 million to schools in Newark, New Jersey.","Critics labeled it an attempt to polish his image, just as the biopic “The Social Network” was being released. Still, there was little questioning his generosity. The problem was that Zuckerberg — who knew little about education — made the gift with few specifics outlining how it should be spent.","“He was just a very young, naive, inexperienced guy who was brilliant at technology and computers and the internet, but just really didn’t know much about how the world worked,” said Dale Russakoff, author of “The Prize,” a book chronicling how the money went to high-priced consultants, with minimal effort by leaders to build community support.","By the end of the process, Zuckerberg had developed a clearer understanding of how to get things done. He and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, have since chartered their own foundation and structured it to take on mammoth goals, like a $3 billion investment to cure, prevent or manage all diseases. He has pledged to donate 99 percent of his Facebook stock to philanthropy.","“Zuck’s maturation has occurred in front of the public,” said Kirkpatrick, author of “The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company that Is Connecting the World.” ″But he also still lives with the consequences of the decisions he made when he was less mature.”","At Facebook, Zuckerberg has grown increasingly bold in using huge sums of money to pursue corporate goals, which includes purchasing competitors — or companies that could grow into competitors.","Facebook’s $1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012 — then unprofitable and little-known — came as a shock to Wall Street. Two years later came the multibillion-dollar deal to buy WhatsApp, a company that remains unprofitable but has given Facebook a prime portal into developing countries and other regions outside the U.S.","In 2014, soon after Facebook bought a virtual reality firm called Oculus, Zuckerberg found himself being grilled in a lawsuit brought by a competitor who accused an Oculus executive of stealing trade secrets. Under questioning, he talked about the pressure he exerted to make the Oculus deal happen, and his vision of growing it so fast “that we can get every developer and studio in the world building just for Oculus before any big competitor exists.”","Last year, in a bid to free up his fortune for philanthropy, Zuckerberg pushed board members to restructure Facebook’s stock, allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control. That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors’ stakes. Days before Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify as part of the suit; the company dropped the plan.","The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg, who advocates for transparency and the interests of the community but whose individual interests don’t always align.","The paradox is self-inflicted, the trade-off for creating a venture premised on users’ willingness to share details of their lives. That requires Zuckerberg, who has 105 million Facebook “friends,” to reveal far more about himself than would be expected of any other CEO, whether it’s photos of him and Chan baking sweets for the Jewish holiday of Purim or dressing their daughters for the Chinese New Year.","Yet he fiercely guards his privacy.","When calls went out last year for Zuckerberg to testify before a Senate committee, the company sent its lawyer. And when he and Chan bought 700 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last year, they quietly filed lawsuits against hundreds of Hawaiians — withdrawn after protests — that would have cut off locals’ access to the land by negating their interest in small ancestral tracts within the estate’s boundaries.","Facebook works hard to present Zuckerberg as someone deeply interested in the ordinary people whose lives are at the heart of its business.","Stops on last year’s U.S. tour, never announced, were set up by facilitators who revealed details to only a select few. But many of the visits were covered by the media and documented in professional-quality photos on Zuckerberg’s Facebook page soon after he’d departed.","Ostensibly, the idea was for Zuckerberg to learn. But in their brief interactions, many people were just as interested in finding a way to connect with him.","In Hazard, Kentucky, educator Paul Green became custodian of the small town’s biggest secret. A staffer from Zuckerberg’s foundation, peppering Green with questions about the region’s educational cooperative, finally admitted it was because the CEO himself wanted to visit. Green’s reward for keeping it quiet was seeing the wide-eyed grins when Zuckerberg pulled up and greeted local high schoolers studying robotics and programming.","Walking through science demonstrations, Zuckerberg spent more time trading tech tales with the teenagers than quizzing the teachers.","“He just lit up with those kids,” Green said. “The way he talked with them about some of the things he did when he was in school and his passion for technology, it really was cool.”","When Zuckerberg toured an oil rig near Williston, North Dakota, last July, “from the minute he got out of the car to the minute he got back in the car, he was nothing but questions,” said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, which arranged the visit.","“I had Bakken shale, limestone, dolomite, and he was able to hold them in his hand, along with a bottle of crude oil. And I remember him asking, ‘How do you get that oil out of that rock?’” geologist Kathleen Neset said.","In Dayton, Ohio, Zuckerberg met with officials, caregivers and families battling drug addiction. Lori Erion, the founder of the group Families of Addicts, said she told him what it was like to learn her daughter, April, had shot up heroin in their own home.","“It seemed to get him really emotional,” Erion said, recalling how Zuckerberg stood up suddenly and told the group he needed a few minutes to steady himself. When he returned, he asked what makes an addict stay clean and how families got their loved ones into treatment.","“We didn’t ever talk about Facebook at all,” Erion said, “which is really interesting because Facebook is really the main way of us getting information out. He really was just like a regular person.”","___","As Zuckerberg connected with Americans face-to-face, controversy over Facebook continued to spiral.","Shortly before the election, McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, warning that Facebook was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended. It wasn’t just about the U.S. election: A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments, and critics had detected a well-organized, clandestine campaign supporting Brexit.","All this pointed to a deep problem with Facebook — that it was simply not equipped or not willing to prevent the misuse of its platform.","McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since.","Facebook has adopted this “libertarian philosophy that says ‘we are not responsible for anything downstream, we are allowed to disrupt media, we are allowed to addict our users and we are not responsible for any of the consequences of any of that,’” he said.","Zuckerberg could change that. But McNamee said it is not enough to hire thousands of workers to weed through fake and abusive posts if those posts keep getting through. And tweaking Facebook’s newsfeed so users see more posts from families and friends does not address his certainty that the algorithms underlying Facebook make it dangerously addictive.","“You cannot cure addiction by doing more of the thing that got you addicted in the first place, which is what Zuck recommends,” McNamee wrote in an email.","Critics say Facebook continues to ignore the possibility of the social network being used for dark purposes, but Zuckerberg’s supporters counter that he is unfairly blamed for problems he could not have foreseen.","Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, credits Zuckerberg with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset, making changes that will nudge users into a more positive virtual environment — without completely shutting out inflammatory content.","“Facebook basically is saying we enable people based on the way they behave. That’s a very democratic argument. If people want to live in filter bubbles, who are we to say ‘Don’t live in filter bubbles,’ even though we don’t want them to?” Hoffman said.","But Kirkpatrick argued that Zuckerberg’s and Sandberg’s surety that Facebook has a positive impact on society has blinded them to parallel realities. The company can’t be fixed, Kirkpatrick said, until Zuckerberg comes to terms with existential threats to the way the social network does business — its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users.","“There’s no question in my mind that Mark Zuckerberg is an ethical and responsible human being who wants to do the right thing,” he said. “However, I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world. And I also don’t think he realizes the extent to which that really is true.”","McNamee, recalling Zuckerberg as a 22-year-old visionary, said the CEO must be willing to rethink long-held assumptions. But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community.","“You’ve won,” McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel.","“You’ve achieved more than your wildest dreams. You’re a billionaire. Now you have a chance to be a hero.”","Jeffrey Lang has joined Movie TV Tech Geeks for 2015 and will be providing his opinion on technology from across the pond in London.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Bannon oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s early efforts to collect troves of Facebook data as part of an ambitious program to build detailed profiles of millions of American voters, a former employee of the data-science firm said Tuesday.","The 2014 effort was part of a high-tech form of voter persuasion touted by the company, which under Bannon identified and tested the power of anti-establishment messages that later would emerge as central themes in President Trump’s campaign speeches, according to Chris Wylie, who left the company at the end of that year.","Among the messages tested were “drain the swamp” and “deep state,” he said.","Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Trump’s 2016 campaign, is now facing questions about alleged unethical practices, including charges that the firm improperly handled the data of tens of millions of Facebook users. On Tuesday, the company’s board announced that it was suspending its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after British television released secret recordings that appeared to show him talking about entrapping political opponents.","More than three years before he served as Trump’s chief political strategist, Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the financial backing of the wealthy Mercer family as part of a broader effort to create a populist power base. Earlier this year, the Mercers cut ties with Bannon after he was quoted making incendiary comments about Trump and his family.","In an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post at his lawyer’s London office, Wylie said that Bannon — while he was a top executive at Cambridge Analytica and head of Breitbart News — was deeply involved in the company’s strategy and approved spending nearly $1 million to acquire data, including Facebook profiles, in 2014.","Stephen K. Bannon, before his time in the White House in the Trump administration, served on the board of Cambridge Analytica. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)","“We had to get Bannon to approve everything at this point. Bannon was Alexander Nix’s boss,” said Wylie, who was Cambridge Analytica’s research director. “Alexander Nix didn’t have the authority to spend that much money without approval.”","Bannon, who served on the company’s board, did not respond to a request for comment. He served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge Analytica from June 2014 to August 2016, when he became chief executive of Trump’s campaign, according to his publicly filed financial disclosure. In 2017, he joined Trump in the White House as his chief strategist.","Bannon received more than $125,000 in consulting fees from Cambridge Analytica in 2016 and owned “membership units” in the company worth between $1 million and $5 million, according to his financial disclosure.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment about Bannon’s role.","It is unclear whether Bannon knew how Cambridge Analytica was obtaining the data, which allegedly was collected through an app that was portrayed as a tool for psychological research but was then transferred to the company.","Facebook has said that information was improperly shared and that it requested the deletion of the data in 2015. Cambridge Analytica officials said that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","Wylie said that both Bannon and Rebekah Mercer, whose father, Robert Mercer, financed the company, participated in conference calls in 2014 in which plans to collect Facebook data were discussed, although Wylie acknowledged that it was not clear they knew the details of how the collection took place.","Bannon “approved the data-collection scheme we were proposing,” Wylie said.","The Mercers did not respond to a request for comment.","The data and analyses that Cambridge Analytica generated in this time provided discoveries that would later form the emotionally charged core of Trump’s presidential platform, said Wylie, whose disclosures in news reports over the past several days have rocked both his onetime employer and Facebook.","“Trump wasn’t in our consciousness at that moment; this was well before he became a thing,” Wylie said. “He wasn’t a client or anything.”","The year before Trump announced his presidential bid, the data firm already had found a high level of alienation among young, white Americans with a conservative bent.","In focus groups arranged to test messages for the 2014 midterms, these voters responded to calls for building a new wall to block the entry of illegal immigrants, to reforms intended to “drain the swamp” of Washington’s entrenched political community and to thinly veiled forms of racism toward African Americans called “race realism,” he recounted.","The firm also tested views of Russian President Vladimir Putin.","“The only foreign thing we tested was Putin,” he said. “It turns out, there’s a lot of Americans who really like this idea of a really strong authoritarian leader and people were quite defensive in focus groups of Putin’s invasion of Crimea.”","The controversy over Cambridge Analytica’s data collection erupted in recent days amid news reports that an app created by a Cambridge University psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, accessed extensive personal data of 50 million Facebook users. The app, called thisisyourdigitallife, was downloaded by 270,000 users. Facebook’s policy, which has since changed, allowed Kogan to also collect data —including names, home towns, religious affiliations and likes — on all of the Facebook “friends” of those users. Kogan shared that data with Cambridge Analytica for its growing database on American voters.","Facebook on Friday banned the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie for improperly sharing that data.","The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook to determine whether the social media platform violated a 2011 consent decree governing its privacy policies when it allowed the data collection. And Wylie plans to testify to Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee as part of their investigation of Russian interference in the election, including possible ties to the Trump campaign.","Meanwhile, Britain’s Channel 4 News aired a video Tuesday in which Nix was shown boasting about his work for Trump. He seemed to highlight his firm’s secrecy, at one point stressing the need to set up a special email account that self-destructs all messages so that “there’s no evidence, there’s no paper trail, there’s nothing.”","The company said in a statement that Nix’s comments “do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.”","Nix could not be reached for comment.","Cambridge Analytica was set up as a U.S. affiliate of British-based SCL Group, which had a wide range of governmental clients globally, in addition to its political work.","Wylie said that Bannon and Nix first met in 2013, the same year that Wylie — a young data whiz with some political experience in Britain and Canada — was working for SCL Group. Bannon and Wylie met soon after and hit it off in conversations about culture, elections and how to spread ideas using technology.","Bannon, Wylie, Nix, Rebekah Mercer and Robert Mercer met in Rebekah Mercer’s Manhattan apartment in the fall of 2013, striking a deal in which Robert Mercer would fund the creation of Cambridge Analytica with $10 million, with the hope of shaping the congressional elections a year later, according to Wylie. Robert Mercer, in particular, seemed transfixed by the group’s plans to harness and analyze data, he recalled.","The Mercers were keen to create a U.S.-based business to avoid bad optics and violating U.S. campaign finance rules, Wylie said. “They wanted to create an American brand,” he said.","The young company struggled to quickly deliver on its promises, Wiley said. Widely available information from commercial data brokers provided people’s names, addresses, shopping habits and more, but failed to distinguish on more fine-grained matters of personality that might affect political views.","Cambridge Analytica initially worked for 2016 Republican candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), who was backed by the Mercers. The Trump campaign had rejected early overtures to hire Cambridge Analytica, and Trump himself said in May 2016 that he “always felt” that the use of voter data was “overrated.”","After Cruz faded, the Mercers switched their allegiance to Trump and pitched their services to Trump’s digital director, Brad Parscale. The company’s hiring was approved by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was informally helping to manage the campaign with a focus on digital strategy.","Kushner said in an interview with Forbes magazine that the campaign “found that Facebook and digital targeting were the most effective ways to reach the audiences. . . .We brought in Cambridge Analytica.” Kushner said he “built” a data hub for the campaign “which nobody knew about, until towards the end.”","Kushner’s spokesman and lawyer both declined to comment Tuesday.","Two weeks before Election Day, Nix told a Post reporter at the company’s New York City office that his company could “determine the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.”","The claim was widely questioned, and the Trump campaign later said that it didn’t rely on psychographic data from Cambridge Analytica. Instead, the campaign said that it used a variety of other digital information to identify probable supporters.","Parscale said in a Post interview in October 2016 that he had not “opened the hood” on Cambridge Analytica’s methodology, and said he got much of his data from the Republican National Committee. Parscale declined to comment Tuesday. He has previously said that the Trump campaign did not use any psychographic data from Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Group, has an ongoing contract with the State Department’s Global Engagement Center. The company was paid almost $500,000 to interview people overseas to understand the mind-set of Islamist militants as part of an effort to counter their online propaganda and block recruits.","Heather Nauert, the acting undersecretary for public diplomacy, said Tuesday that the contract was signed in November 2016, under the Obama administration, and has not expired yet. In public records, the contract is dated in February 2017, and the reason for the discrepancy was not clear. Nauert said that the State Department had signed other contracts with SCL Group in the past."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

Over the weekend, Android owners were displeased to discover that Facebook had been scraping their text-message and phone-call metadata, in some cases for years, an operation hidden in the fine print of a user agreement clause until Ars Technica reported. Facebook was quick to defend the practice as entirely aboveboard—small comfort to those who are beginning to realize that, because Facebook is a free service, they and their data are by necessity the products.","In its current iteration, Facebook’s Messenger application requests that those who download it give it permission to access incoming and outgoing call and text logs. But, as users discovered when prompted to download a copy of their personal data before permanently deleting their Facebook accounts, a certain amount of data was covertly siphoned without explicit permissions. Buried inside those data caches was an unsettling amount of specific, detailed information—in some cases, every phone call or text message ever sent or received on their Android device. Dylan McKay, who apparently owns an Android phone, reported that for the period between November 2016 and July 2017, his archives contained “the metadata of every cellular call I’ve ever made, including time and duration” and “metadata about every text message I’ve ever received or sent.” When people like McKay agreed to share their contacts with Facebook, it appears they didn’t know the extent to which they were giving Facebook access to their personal information.","Facebook responded with a blog post laying out the applicable user-agreement terms and denying that Facebook collects call or SMS data surreptitiously. “Contact uploading is optional. People are expressly asked if they want to give permission to upload their contacts from their phone—it’s explained right there in the apps when you get started,” the company said in a statement to the Guardian. “People can delete previously uploaded information at any time and can find all the information available to them in their account and activity log from our Download Your Information tool.”","But the revelation couldn’t have come at a worse time for Facebook, which is trying—and failing—to dig itself out from under the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. On Sunday, the company released a full-page print advertisement in the U.K.’s The Observer,The Sunday Times,Mail on Sunday,Sunday Mirror,Sunday Express, and the Sunday Telegraph, along with American newspapers The New York Times,The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal, in an attempt to regain public trust. In the ad, Zuckerberg called the Cambridge Analytica leak a “breach of trust” and apologized, reassuring readers that “we’re now taking steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again,” but so far it seems to have missed the mark. According to a poll from SurveyMonkey and Axios published on Monday, Facebook’s already-low favorability rating has dropped twice as much as that of other tech giants from October 2017 to March 2018."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

You shouldn’t have to wade through complicated privacy settings in order to ensure that the companies with which you’ve entrusted your personal information are making reasonable, legal efforts to protect it. But Facebook has allowed third parties to violate user privacy on an unprecedented scale, and, while legislators and regulators scramble to understand the implications and put limits in place, users are left with the responsibility to make sure their profiles are properly configured.","Over the weekend, it became clear that Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics company, got access to more than 50 million Facebook users’ data in 2014. The data was overwhelmingly collected, shared, and stored without user consent. The scale of this violation of user privacy reflects how Facebook’s terms of service and API were structured at the time. Make no mistake: this was not a data breach. This was exactly how Facebook’s infrastructure was designed to work.","In addition to raising questions about Facebook’s role in the 2016 presidential election, this news is a reminder of the inevitable privacy risks that users face when their personal information is captured, analyzed, indefinitely stored, and shared by a constellation of data brokers, marketers, and social media companies.","Tech companies can and should do more to protect users, including giving users far more control over what data is collected and how that data is used. That starts with meaningful transparency and allowing truly independent researchers—with no bottom line or corporate interest—access to work with, black-box test, and audit their systems. Finally, users need to be able to leave when a platform isn’t serving them — and take their data with them when they do.","Of course, you could choose to leave Facebook entirely, but for many that is not a viable solution, unfortunately. For now, if you’d like keep your data from going through Facebook’s API, you can take control of your privacy settings. Keep in mind that this disables ALL platform apps (like Farmville, Twitter, or Instagram) and you will not be able to log into sites using your Facebook login.","If disabling platform entirely is too much, there is another setting that can help: limiting the personal information accessible by apps that others use. By default, other people who can see your info can bring it with them when they use apps, and your info becomes available to those apps. You can limit this as follows.","From the same page, click “Edit” under “Apps Others Use.” Then uncheck the types of information that you don’t want others’ apps to be able to access. For most people reading this post, that will mean unchecking every category."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The company just announced that it will end a feature called Partner Categories, launched back in 2013 out of a partnership between Facebook and major data brokers.","Third party data helps Facebook further atomize its user base into meaningful segments for advertisers. As TechCrunch explained when the data partnership first launched:","“Through new partnerships with top online and offline purchase data providers Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai, Facebook is now allowing advertisers to target hashed lists of existing and potential customers, and categories like role-playing gamers or soda drinkers.”","Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that the change is permanent, not a temporary precaution. In order to leverage the deep pool of data Facebook collects on users, the company mixes information that it obtains from users themselves (Pages a user liked, for instance) with information from advertisers (membership status in a loyalty program, for example) and with data obtained from third party providers.","While Facebook feels comfortable with the integrity of its data sourcing within the first two categories, it feels less settled about dipping into these aggregate pools of third party data. The decision was issued in light of the company’s recent privacy concerns over third-party data mishandling.","Facebook Product Marketing Director Graham Mudd elaborated on the decision in a statement:","“We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories. This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.”","Facebook clarified that it will still work with companies like Experian and Acxiom in order to measure ad performance and provide metrics, although it will also be conducting a review of those ongoing relationships. Facebook may also move toward sharing data in a shared server environment in order to offer further assurances of user privacy.

Not only us but our family members, some of whom aren’t even on the platform. That’s because it’s all tied into other properties like Instagram, those pages you visit that Facebook is connected to… on and on… as well as our participation on Facebook; shame on us… maybe…\nWhy maybe? Because it’s possible that some of you have followed my advice when it comes to what you share about family or taking precautions against using and doing certain things so Facebook can’t get to them. Let me share my story first.","Are we connected on Facebook? If not, try to find me there on Google or any of your own search engines. You can’t, can you? You won’t either. Facebook has a privacy setting for that, so only people you openly share your Facebook link with can find you. And if you don’t grant them access, or later on you remove them, they’re pretty much gone forever… unless someone else lets them in by sharing something you’ve put up.","While that’s always potentially problematic, I have a rule of thumb governing it; be open and truthful without sharing it all. For my personal feed, I have it sculpted so only people I want to see what I post will initially see it. Every once in a while someone sees something I posted because they’re connected to someone I’m connected to. Luckily, I don’t have a lot of people I’m worried about sharing anything with… just some folks I’d rather make it harder for them to see.","For instance, I don’t share my birthday; my wife’s name, Mom’s name or my home address. I’m not listed in the phone book (who still has one of those?) and very few people have my mobile number. My business website lists my PO box number and my business line. My business line can be tracked to my home address easily enough, but I’ve found that most people have no clue about how to do it. I’m not going to tell you if you don’t know, but even if you do, I’m not worried about anyone finding out. Trust me, you’ll stand out in this neighborhood and there’s a lot of nosy neighbors. lol","I share what I don’t mind being seen by anyone. I don’t drink or smoke or take drugs, and I’ve also never said a curse word; no worries about anyone seeing any salacious behavior from me. If I’m out of town I’m not worried about anyone sneaking up to the house and robbing me; I have nosy neighbors, an alarm system, and lights and cameras covering the back of the house (which is hard to get into anyway since it’s wooded, there are animals of all types out there) when I’m away… which isn’t happening as long as Mom’s here with me.","I don’t have Facebook on my phone; never have. I also don’t have Messenger on my phone; I hate being tracked, although Android gets to track me since I have a lousy sense of direction and need it to help me get where I need to go.","I’ve never gone to any websites and liked anyone’s Facebook link; I’ve never even considered it. I also can’t be tracked by Facebook as long as I’m using Firefox because I use an add-on called Facebook Tracking and Ad Removal. Any page connected to Facebook is automatically blocked; I’m covered! By the way, in case someone says “hey, your share button includes linking to Facebook”… no one’s ever clicked it and if someone wants to share something I wrote that way, who am I do say they can’t? 🙂","The point I’m making is that if you want to be on Facebook for your own reasons and you’re worried about your privacy, you can do or don’t do things to help protect it. Nothing’s 100%; not even me being truthful to the masses (I’ll tell you what I want to tell you and that’s all!).","A good first step is learning how to set some privacy filters on their website. I know you think I’m going to tell you how to do it; nope! That’s because Holly (can’t believe she’s getting a 2nd mention) has already done it for you in a post from 2015 where she actually show you how to set your privacy settings. If you follow her instructions, then you go back and read the link above on how I’ve sculpted my Facebook feed, you’ll be at least 80% more private than you are now. And if you use Firefox or Chrome and add FB Purity to the mix, you’ll also be much happier.","There are a lot of articles telling people they should delete their Facebook accounts because of privacy issues. Trust me, if you’re alive and someone really wants to find you, they can pay for the information; so much for privacy. If you’re like my wife and have an anathema to social media in general, you’ll be just fine. If you’ve enjoyed some of your social media experience, just be diligent about it.","26 comments on “How Much Can You Control Access To Your Facebook Information?”","I think that the part people are missing is this: Facebook has it ALL. They have your “Me only” posts. They have your “Friends only” posts. They have your IMs, and if you use Messenger, most likely they also have your SMS and MMS messages. All of which may have been scraped up and exploited by third parties using much more sophisticated data mining tools than your nosy neighbor, Gladys. Add in a little regression analysis against aggregated social data about personality traits, things certain types of people are likely to like and share, and other data about how they behave and interact online, and they know you better than you know yourself.","Don’t lull yourself into complacency by thinking you haven’t overshared. You may not have. But if you ever let an app weasel its way into your Friends’ profiles (which is very, very easy to do), then you’ve opened the back door to their privacy (potentially) as well. We know this is how imposter accounts operate. Apparently, CA was up to a bit of that, but with more intelligent staffers and goals.","They could’ve scraped the web, for that matter. Honestly, unless it’s heavily encrypted, anything stored digitally and connected to the Internet is vulnerable.","It can be scary to walk across the street, too. But someone takes you by the hand, when you’re small, and says, “Here’s how crossing the street works. Here’s what happens when a car hits your little body.” And they practice with you. Over and over, until you get it right, 99.9% of the time time. But it only takes that one time…","Every year – some years, ever day – we learn of new online vulnerabilities and ways we can be abused online. It takes time to figure out solutions. The Equifax breach was arguably way worse in the long run, and what can we really do about that?","I deactivated Facebook, by the way. I didn’t delete it. There’s no guarantee that the data would be inaccessible to anyone but me. Once deleted, the URL might be reused by someone with nefarious purposes, if they allowed it to be recycled like an old phone number. What’s there is there; what’s done is done. This is more of a boycott. I’m not giving them anything new. I’m not contributing to their illusion that the humans aren’t outnumbered by bots and fraudsters. I’m not playing on their playground, viewing their ads, or buying their disingenuous “our bad” videos. Nope. They can go delete themselves.Holly Jahangiri recently posted…I’m Not a Patsy for Russian Propaganda, YOU Are! 😛","Here’s the thing about me. I might have 15 or so people on my smartphone as contacts. I don’t give the number out, so if I had any apps on my phone in that regard it wouldn’t be all that invasive. Google is way more invasive if people created a G Plus page years ago; when I got my first Samsung Galaxy phone, I suddenly had over 400 people in my contact list along with their addresses and phone numbers; ouch! That was the one day I had a conniption because I knew it was linking my email address and possibly my smartphone number with that many people (I never put my smartphone anywhere online but Google owns Android so I fretted at the time).","I can only control what I put on Facebook and anywhere else. I’m never lulled into complacency; I block things all over the place, I’m wary of giving out certain types of information… you can’t be a military kid who grew up during the Cold War and be a trusting sort. lol Firefox has a lot of apps that offer more protection than other browsers; it’s the reason I’ve stuck with them so long.","We can’t run, we can’t hide, but we can make it harder for folk to get info.

Yes, the audacity!","You know, part of me doesn’t totally blame Facebook. Sometimes I see them as a naive child who thinks that guy with the puppy they don’t really know is their best friend in the whole world. They’re products of their generation; we were a lot less trusting. I’m not sure if we’d created Facebook that it would have become as big as it did because of the self restrictions we’d have put on it; still, they need to start thinking a bit more about how their platform is being used by their “partners”.","I’m a frequent Facebook user, in fact, my whole family is but this sure is a wake -up call not just for us but to all FB users. This is scary. Not sure if a lot of people are aware of this but you can now receive notification message through their messenger everytime you transact with Paypal. I accidentally hit the agree to button one day and ended up receiving notifications. I’m really more concern with Google than Facebook. I feel like Google has been following me around all the time. They really track your devices.","I’m with you there. I don’t trust either of them but I trust Google less. They got rid of their own motto about not doing evil; to me that’s saying something. Your story helps to reinforce why I don’t have either Facebook or Messenger on my phone; they don’t need access to my private stuff… even if I only have a few private things on it.","I don’t worry much about anything like this. My info was out there before FaceBook and they keep collecting more. Every time I use my credit card someone out there has a ton of information on me based on that transaction. We might limit our presence, but it’s probably impossible to stay completely off the radar.Arlee Bird recently posted…Hunkering Down for the Storm ( #BOTB Results )","You don’t control anything on Facebook.

They’re now a bit more protective of logged in users; I assume they HAVE the data, but they don’t just make it readily available to all and sundry like they used to.","I would assume that any data you enter into the PC, that goes across the internet unencrypted, is readable individually or in the aggregate by machines and system administrators (most of whom are too overworked to bother or want to, frankly). This includes IMs, emails, search terms, what you post to Facebook or Twitter, and even what you start to type into Facebook but think better of posting (that’s creepy, but you see those little moving wavy dots that say the other person is typing?)","There’s no real privacy on the Internet – just the illusion of it. We have a right, I think, to a certain duty of care from providers – that what we share is shared for agreed upon and reasonable purposes, and that what we believe is private (based on the platform’s security and privacy tools and messaging) is kept reasonably private and secure.","Whether we think the rest is “creepy,” “stalkerish,” or whatever is immaterial. For every beneficial technological advance out there, there is a potential abuse and negative result. ALL platforms, regardless of our perception or loyalty, are subject to this. What I care about is whether they honestly and in good faith do what they say they will do or not do. It’s about the ethics or lack thereof.

Hundreds if not thousands of pages of code, as well as detailed notes signed by AggregateIQ staff, wholly substantiate recent reports that Cambridge Analytica’s software platform was not its own creation.","Advertisement","What’s more, the files reveal that AggregateIQ—also known as “AIQ”—is the developer behind campaign apps created for Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, as well as a Ukrainian steel magnate named Serhiy Taruta, head the country’s newly formed Osnova party.","Other records show the firm once pitched an app to Breitbart News, the far-right website funded by hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer—Cambridge Analytica’s principal investor—and are currently contracted by WPA Intelligence, a US-based consultancy founded by Republican pollster Chris Wilson, who was director of digital strategy for Cruz’s 2016 presidential campaign.","A screenshot shows an AIQ developer working on code for Cambridge Analytica’s Ripon software in August 2015.","A screenshot shows an AIQ developer working on code for Cambridge Analytica’s Ripon software in September 2015.","A screenshot shows an AIQ developer working on code for Cambridge Analytica’s Ripon software in mid-2015. In one line, the developer mentions integration with Ted Cruz’s app, “Cruz Crew.”","A screenshot shows an AIQ developer working on code for Cambridge Analytica’s Ripon software in August 2015.","1 / 4","Advertisement","The files were unearthed last week by Chris Vickery, research director at UpGuard, a California-based cyber risk firm. On Sunday night, after Gizmodo reached out to Jeff Silvester, co-founder of AIQ, the files were quickly taken offline.","The files are likely to draw the interest of investigators on both sides of the Atlantic. Canadian and British regulators are currently pursuing leads to establish whether multiple “Leave” campaigns illegally coordinated during the 2016 EU referendum.","Ties between AIQ and Cambridge Analytica—the focus of recent widespread furor over the misuse of data pulled from 50 million Facebook accounts—has likewise drawn the interest of US and British authorities. Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix was suspended by his company last week after British reporters published covertly recorded footage showing Nix boasting about bribing and blackmailing political rivals.","Advertisement","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment.","“Ultimately, I found out through some emails that they’re not even doing this work. It was being outsourced to AIQ.”","AIQ is bound by an non-disclosure agreement the company signed in 2014 to take on former client SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, according to a source with direct knowledge of the contract.","Advertisement","In an interview over the weekend with London’s The Observer, Christopher Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, claimed that he helped establish AIQ years ago in an effort to help SCL Group expand its data operations. Silvester denied that Wylie was ever involved on that level, but admits that Wylie helped AIQ land its first big contract.","“We did some work with SCL and had a contract with them in 2014 for some custom software development,” Silvester told Gizmodo. “We last worked with SCL in 2016 and have not worked with them since.”","Data Exposed","UpGuard first discovered code belonging to AIQ last Thursday on the web page of a developer named Ali Yassine who worked for SCL Group. Within the code—uploaded to the website GitHub in August 2016—are notes that show SCL had requested that code be turned over by AIQ’s lead developer, Koji Hamid Pourseyed.","Advertisement","AIQ’s contract with SCL, a portion of which was published by The Guardian last year, stipulates that SCL is the sole owner of the intellectual property pertaining to the contract—namely, the development of Ripon, Cambridge Analytica’s campaign platform.","The find led UpGuard to unearth a code repository on AIQ’s website. Within it were countless files linking AIQ to the Ripon program, as well as notes related to active projects for Cruz, Abbott, and the Ukrainian oligarch.","A mockup of a “meme generator” being developed by AIQ for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s phone app.","Advertisement","In an internal wiki, AIQ developers also discussed a project known as The Database of Truth, a system that “integrates, obtains, and normalizes data from disparate sorces, including starting with the RNC Data Trust.” (RNC Data Trust is the Republican party’s primary voter file provider.) “The primary data source will be combined with state voter files, consumer data, third party data providers, historical WPA survey and projects and customer data.”","The Database of Truth, according to the wiki, is a project under development for WPA Intelligence.","Screenshot: AIQ","Advertisement","Wilson told Gizmodo on Monday that he has almost no knowledge of the controversy unfolding over AIQ’s role in the UK. “I would never work with a firm that I felt had done something illegal or even unethical,” he said. AIQ’s work for WPA followed a competitive bid process, he said. “They offered us the best capabilities for the best price.”","Vaporware","Until recently, Cambridge Analytica operated largely in the shadows. For years, it planned to target right-leaning voters for a host of high-profile political campaigns, working for both Cruz and President Donald Trump. With its billionaire backing, the firm promised to leverage oceans of data collected about voters—which we now know was acquired from sources both legal and unauthorized.","Advertisement","Known as Project Ripon, Cambridge Analytica’s goal was to furnish Republican candidates with a technology platform capable of reaching voters through the use of psychological profiling. (SCL Group has long used behavioral research to conduct “influence operations” on behalf of military and political clients worldwide.)","Cambridge Analytica, which eventually chose AIQ to help build its platform, once boasted that it possessed files on as many as 230 million Americans compiled from thousands of data points, including psychological data harvested from social media, as well as commercial data available to virtually anyone who can afford it. The company intended to classify voters by select personality types, applying its system to craft messages, online ads, and mailers that, it believed, would resonate distinctively with voters of each group.","Sources within the Cruz campaign, which largely funded Ripon’s development, claim the software never actually functioned. One former staffer told Gizmodo the product was nothing but “vaporware.”","Advertisement","AIQ’s internal files show the company had unlimited access to the Ripon code, and a source within the Cruz campaign confirmed to Gizmodo that AIQ was solely responsible for the software’s development.","The campaign eventually dumped more than $5.8 million into Ripon’s development—which is only about half the amount Robert Mercer, Cambridge Analytica’s principal investor, poured into Cruz’s White House bid. (After Trump took the nomination, Mercer contributed more than $15.5 million to his campaign, $5 million of which ended up back in Cambridge Analytica’s pockets.)","A former Cruz aide, who requested anonymity to discuss their work for the campaign, told Gizmodo that even at the highest levels, no one knew that Cambridge Analytica had outsourced Ripon’s development. “Ultimately, I found out through some emails that they’re not even doing this work,” the source said. “It was being outsourced to AIQ.”","Advertisement","According to the aide, when Cruz’s staff began to question AIQ over whether it was behind Ripon’s development, AIQ confirmed that it was, but said it was never supposed to discuss its work.","The Brexit","In 2016, Mercer reportedly offered up Cambridge Analytica’s services for free to Leave.EU, one of several group urging the UK to depart the European Union, according to The Guardian. Leave.EU was not, however, the official “Leave” group representing the Brexit campaign. Instead, a seperate group, known as Vote Leave, was formally chosen by election officials to lead the referendum.","Advertisement","Whereas Leave.EU relied on Cambridge to influence voters through its use of data analytics, Vote Leave turned to AIQ, eventually paying the firm roughly 40 percent of its £7 million campaign budget, according to The Guardian. Over time, however, Vote Leave amassed more cash than it was legally allowed to spend. While UK election laws permitted Vote Leave to gift its remaining funds to other campaigns, further coordination between them was expressly forbidden.","“All of the direction for BeLeave came from BeLeave and all of the direction for Vote Leave came from Vote Leave.”","Roughly a week before the EU referendum, Vote Leave inexplicably donated £625,000 to a young fashion design student named Darren Grimes, the founder of a small, unofficial Brexit campaign called BeLeave. According to a BuzzFeed investigation, Grimes immediately gave a “substantial amount” of the cash he received from Vote Leave to AIQ. Vote Leave also donated £100,000 to another Leave campaign called Veterans for Britain, which, according to TheGuardian, then paid AIQ precisely that amount.","Advertisement","A review of the AIQ files by UpGuard’s Chris Vickery revealed several mentions of Vote Leave and at least one mention of Veterans for Britain, apparently related to website development.","In an interview on Monday, Shahmir Sanni, a former volunteer for Vote Leave campaign, told The Globe and Mail that he had “first-hand knowledge about the alleged wrongdoing in the Brexit campaign.” Sanni, who was 22 when he worked for Vote Leave, said he was “encouraged to spin out” another campaign, but that he had “no control” over the £625,000 that was immediately spent on AIQ’s services.","British authorities are pursuing leads to establish whether BeLeave and Veterans for Britain were merely a conduit through which Vote Leave sought to direct additional funds to AIQ. While the UK Electoral Commission took no action in early 2017, in November it claimed that “new information” had “come to light,” giving the commission “reasonable grounds to suspect an offence may have been committed.”","Advertisement","In an email, the UK Election Commission told Gizmodo its investigation into Vote Leave payments was ongoing.","“All of the direction for BeLeave came from BeLeave and all of the direction for Vote Leave came from Vote Leave,” AIQ’s co-founder told Gizmodo.","Silvester added: “AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates. It has never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity. All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

What happened with Cambridge Analytica was a breach of Facebook’s trust. More importantly, it was a breach of the trust people place in Facebook to protect their data when they share it. As Mark Zuckerberg explained in his post, we are announcing some important steps for the future of our platform. These steps involve taking action on potential past abuse and putting stronger protections in place to prevent future abuse.","People use Facebook to connect with friends and others using all kinds of apps. Facebook’s platform helped make apps social — so your calendar could show your friends’ birthdays, for instance. To do this, we allowed people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them.","As people used the Facebook platform in new ways, we strengthened the rules. We required that developers get people’s permission before they access the data needed to run their apps – for instance, a photo sharing app has to get specific permission from you to access your photos. Over the years we’ve introduced more guardrails, including in 2014, when we began reviewing apps that request certain data before they could launch, and introducing more granular controls for people to decide what information to share with apps. These actions would prevent any app like Aleksandr Kogan’s from being able to access so much data today.","Even with these changes, we’ve seen abuse of our platform and the misuse of people’s data, and we know we need to do more. We have a responsibility to everyone who uses Facebook to make sure their privacy is protected. That’s why we’re making changes to prevent abuse. We’re going to set a higher standard for how developers build on Facebook, what people should expect from them, and, most importantly, from us. We will:","Review our platform. We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform in 2014 to reduce data access, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. If we find developers that misused personally identifiable information, we will ban them from our platform.","Tell people about data misuse. We will tell people affected by apps that have misused their data. This includes building a way for people to know if their data might have been accessed via “thisisyourdigitallife.” Moving forward, if we remove an app for misusing data, we will tell everyone who used it.","Turn off access for unused apps. If someone hasn’t used an app within the last three months, we will turn off the app’s access to their information.","Restrict Facebook Login data.We are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.","Encourage people to manage the apps they use. We already show people what apps their accounts are connected to and control what data they’ve permitted those apps to use. Going forward, we’re going to make these choices more prominent and easier to manage.","Reward people who find vulnerabilities. In the coming weeks we will expand Facebook’s bug bounty program so that people can also report to us if they find misuses of data by app developers.","There’s more work to do, and we’ll be sharing details in the coming weeks about additional steps we’re taking to put people more in control of their data. Some of these updates were already in the works, and some are related to new data protection laws coming into effect in the EU. This week’s events have accelerated our efforts, and these changes will be the first of many we plan to roll out to protect people’s information and make our platform safer."],"isopubdate":""}

In the ad, founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote “We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it.”","The company’s response to the Ars Technica story, however, struck a different tone, with Facebook titling the post “Fact Check: Your Call and SMS History.” It said “You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case,” before going on to explain that call and text history logging is included with an opt-in feature on Messenger or Facebook Lite for Android that “people have to expressly agree to use” and that they can turn off at any time, which would also delete any call and text data shared with that app.","Ars Technica has already amended its original post with a response to Facebook’s statement, saying it contradicts several of its findings, including the experience of users who shared their data with the publication.","“In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used,” wrote Ars Technica IT and national security editor Sean Gallagher in the amendment to his post. “Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.”","In its statement, Facebook said “Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and services as a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with. This was first introduced in Messenger in 2015, and later offered as an option in Facebook Lite, a lightweight version of Facebook for Android.”","When people first sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android or log into Messenger on an Android device, they see a screen giving them the option to continuously upload contacts as well as call and text history. Facebook added that on Messenger, users are then given three options: to turn the feature on, “learn more” for more information or “not now” to skip it. On Facebook Lite, they get two options: turn it on or skip. If users who opted in change their minds later, Facebook said they could turn it off in the app’s settings, with the option of turning off continuous call and text history logging while keeping contact uploading enabled or deleting all contact information they’ve uploaded from that app.”","An image included with Facebook’s statement.","Facebook emphasized in bold text that it “never sell this data, and this feature does not collect the content of your text messages or calls.”","Even though the opt-in screens do state that granting permission will “continuously upload info” about contacts and call and text history, it is arguable that many users don’t really understand what that means and that instead of saying “this lets friends find each other on Facebook and helps us create a better experience for everyone” (a message sweetened with a saccharine cartoon of a figure texting a little heart), Facebook should really be giving more details about what exactly will be recorded and why.","With the Cambridge Analytica scandal still fresh on everyone’s minds, Facebook’s apparent willingness to place the onus for protecting personal data on users who already feel victimized is unlikely to help them regain any goodwill. But even people who truly understand the implications of the feature and chose to opt-in anyway did so assuming that their data would be guarded as Facebook promised.

The person who has a fiduciary duty is called the fiduciary, and the person to whom he owes the duty, is typically referred to as the principal or the beneficiary. If an individual breaches the fiduciary duties, he or she would need to account for the ill-gotten profit. His or her beneficiaries are entitled to damages, even if they suffered no harm.","Fiduciary duties exist to encourage specialization and induce people to enter into a fiduciary relationship. By imposing these duties, the law reduces the risk of abuse of a beneficiary by the fiduciary. As a result, potential beneficiaries can have greater confidence in seeking out a fiduciary.","1. Corporations and Fiduciary Duty","In discussing corporate fiduciary duties, it is very helpful to refer to the corporate law of Delaware. More than half of publicly traded companies are incorporated in Delaware. Nonetheless, corporations incorporated in other states may be bound by different rules and obligations. Consult Table of Statutes for statutes in specific jurisdictions.","Directors of corporations, in fulfilling their managerial responsibilities, are charged with certain fiduciary duties. The primary duties are the duty of care and the duty of loyalty.","Duty of Loyalty: As the Delaware Supreme Court explained in Guth v. Loft, 5 A.2d 503, 510 (Del. 1939): “Corporate officers and directors are not permitted to use their position of trust and confidence to further their private interests. . . . A public policy, existing through the years, and derived from a profound knowledge of human characteristics and motives, has established a rule that demands of a corporate officer or director, peremptorily and inexorably, the most scrupulous observance of his duty, not only affirmatively to protect the interests of the corporation committed to his charge, but to refrain from doing anything that would work injury to the corporation, or to deprive it of profit or advantage which his skill and ability might properly bring to it, or to enable it to make in the reasonable and lawful exercise of its power.”","Duty of Prudence: Requires a trustee to administer a trust with a degree of care, skill, and caution that a prudent trustee would exercise. Consult Amgen Inc. v. Harris, 136 S. Ct. 758 (2016) for more information.","Duty of Disclosure: This duty requires directors to act with “complete candor.” In certain circumstances, this requires the directors to disclose to the stockholders “all of the facts and circumstances” relevant to the directors’ decision.","3. Fiduciary or Confidential Relations","Certain relationships impose fiduciary duties. For example, attorneys have a fiduciary duty to their client, a principal to his agent, a guardian to his ward, a priest to his parishioner, and a doctor to his patient. Fiduciary duty is imposed whenever confidence is reposed on one side in a contractual relationship, so as to allow that side to exert influence and dominance over the other.","Different states treat transactions between the fiduciary and the beneficiary differently, but typically in favor of favor of the beneficiary. Thus, transactions between parties in a fiduciary or confidential relationship are voidable, or prima facie voidable, or may be declared void, or the contract may be canceled. The fiduciary must prove the transaction was fair."],"isopubdate":"2016-07-27"}

(Facebook / via The Associated Press)","From the new page, users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them, such as their political preferences or interests, and download and review a file of data Facebook has collected about them. Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information.","Facebook began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after revelations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million users of the social network. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reawakened fears over how much information the social network has gathered about people, leading to a #DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism.","“The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, a Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement announcing the new system. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.”","The Cambridge Analytica scandal has plunged Facebook into its worst crisis in years, with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain demanding answers about how the social network deals with data privacy. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has agreed to appear in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill next month, people familiar with the decision have said.","Last week, Zuckerberg said in a statement that Facebook had to do better with user data and promised to roll out products that give users more control over their information and privacy settings.","Opinion: The issue wasn’t whether you’d done something evil or just embarrassing. It was that your legitimate data could be used to manipulate you and others to benefit forces that were greedy or dangerous.","“One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data,” he told The New York Times last week. “Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar.”","Article Continued Below","From the new centralized page, people will be able to opt out of sharing certain traits — for example, they can indicate that they no longer want to be identified as someone who loves cats. That information, by extension, will no longer be sent to advertisers.","Facebook also plans to clarify the information being gathered by apps that hook into Facebook. Several seemingly innocent apps that allow users to play games with their friends or share photos could also be quietly monitoring their posts, interactions with friends, and contacts. In the new centralized page, people will be given a streamlined list of what each app is collecting on them, as well as the ability to delete the apps.","Some privacy advocates wondered whether the new system would make a difference.","“The platform made similar promises many times before,” said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies how technology affects society. She pointed out that in 2010, Zuckerberg said in the Washington Post that Facebook users needed simpler controls over their privacy and had promised then that Facebook would “add privacy controls that are much simpler to use.”","Yet eight years later, the same concerns have resurfaced, Tufekci said.","“The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves, aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its CEO,” she said.","More from The Star & Partners","LOADING","Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Bannon, who recently returned to his position as chair of the far-right website Breitbart, defended President Donald Trump’s Middle East policies, arguing the administration’s engagement with the Muslim world has been successful.","“What’s been accomplished in a very short period of time to me is amazing,” said Bannon.","Bannon was especially proud of Trump’s summit in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh last May, where the president joined Egyptian strongman Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Saudi King Salman in placing their hands on a white glowing orb to commemorate the opening of a new counterterror center.

It was important for the Arab world. It was important to show that the United States is fully engaged.”","Bannon pointed out that in the weeks after the summit, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates escalated their feud with Qatar. The conference served as a staging ground for a major offensive in the public relations campaign against Qatar, part of a long-simmering feud between the tiny Gulf Sheikdom and other U.S. allies on the Arabian Peninsula. And Bannon, who has financial ties to the UAE, was wading in.","“The single most important thing that’s happening in the world is the situation in Qatar,” Bannon said. “Qatar finally had to be called to account for the continual funding for the Muslim Brotherhood, continual funding for Hamas.”","The former top White House adviser also pointed to the change in the Saudi monarchy’s line of succession to appoint Mohammed Bin Salman, the king’s hawkish son, as an heir. The change sparked a crackdown in Saudi Arabia, with the government rounding up and detaining prominent clerics, regime critics, activists, and a journalist, according to the New York Times. Bannon appeared to approve of the crackdown.","“If you look at Saudi Arabia, they’ve had a pretty big fundamental change since the summit,” he said. “The deputy crown prince is now the crown prince. I think it was two weeks ago or three weeks ago, there were 1,000 clerics rounded up or put under house arrest or whatever. I realize that the opposition party in the New York Times refer to most of them as ‘liberal scholars.’”","The fact Bannon was speaking at all was unusual. He joined a roster of other notable speakers, including former Obama administration Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, former CIA Director David Petraeus, and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a leading Iran hawk on Capitol Hill.","Panetta had argued in the past that Bannon’s policies actually fuel recruitment for Islamic extremists. He said that Trump’s travel ban, which Bannon was an architect of, “fed ISIS a major argument that I think will help them in recruiting and that increases the chances of a potential attack in this country.” He also said it was “wrong” for Bannon to have been appointed to the National Security Council. Panetta was booked through his speaking agency for an undisclosed fee and told McClatchy he wasn’t aware that Bannon would be there.","All the marquee speakers hit similar notes on Qatar. “Qatar, frankly, has a mixed record,” said Panetta. “We know they’ve provided support, financial support, for the Muslim Brotherhood, for Hamas, for elements of Al Qaeda, and the Taliban. And the problem is, they can’t have it both ways.”","In June, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar and imposed a punishing blockade, accusing the country of supporting groups, like Al Qaeda and the Taliban. There is truth to the accusation, but Saudi Arabia also funds extremist groups, and experts have suggested that the move to punish Qatar may be more about the country’s decision to maintain ties with Iran, its funding for the Islamist populists of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the other Persian Gulf states’ dissatisfaction with Al Jazeera, the Qatari state-run news channel.","The Trump administration initially responded to the feud by sending mixed messages. While Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged the Persian Gulf states to end the blockade, Trump praised it, tweeting, “Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!”","Bannon made clear which side he took. Saudi Arabia and the UAE had a “well-thought-out plan,” he said, and the measures those countries took reflected their commitment at the Riyadh summit to cut off funding for terror groups. “I’m not a foreign policy expert by far, but I took a very hard line on that,” he said. “It’s well within the rights of people we agreed with at that summit — there was going to be an effort for a 100 percent cutoff of radical Islamic terrorism.”","The showdown has been a cash cow for American lobbying and PR firms that are lining up on both sides to sway American policymakers and the public, including Bannon. Just hours before the conference Monday, McClatchy reported that a PR firm with close ties to Bannon, SCL Social Limited, was paid over $300,000 by the UAE to post negative ads about Qatar on social media. That’s on top of millions paid to a constellation of PR firms and lobbyists that push the UAE and Saudi lines in D.C.","Qatar also has its own army of lobbyists, even paying former Attorney General John Ashcroft’s firm $2.5 million for just three months of work.","Asked by former Pakistani ambassador to Washington, Husain Haqqani, the event’s moderator and a Hudson official, about his ties to SCL Social Limited, Bannon said he had “nothing to do” with the company. Upon entering the White House, however, Bannon had disclosed that he had between $1 million and $5 million stake in a company called Cambridge Analytica, which shares the same leadership and ownership as SCL Social Limited.","At the conference, Panetta and Petraeus both condemned Qatar for its behavior and offered only light condemnation of other Persian Gulf states for supporting extremism. If there was any confusion about the main target of the event, a copy of an ominously titled documentary, “Qatar: A Dangerous Alliance,” could be found at every seat. The documentary also featured a speaker from the Middle East Institute, which recently accepted a $20 million donation from the UAE.","Asked about the appropriateness of interviewing Bannon — whose Breitbart News strategized with some neo-Nazi figures — on the topic of extremism, Haqqani said, “Mine was not a fawning, supportive interview.” He added, “The man has an opinion, we should hear it.”","Despite the one-sided subject matter at the conference, Hudson Institute public affairs head David Tell denied the think tank takes any UAE or other Persian Gulf money. “Hudson has not ever accepted financial contributions from the UAE government or anyone connected thereto — and would not as a matter of formal institutional policy,” Stewart said.","The Hudson Institute did not clarify whether it coordinated with foreign governments in a non-financial manner. The UAE has been active in Washington’s think tank world, offering funding and coordinating with others that serve its agenda. McClatchy reported that some of the funding for the Monday event was provided by Elliott Broidy, a prominent Trump fundraiser.","The lone dissenter from the anti-Qatar consensus was Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., who appeared on a panel of congressional leaders. He criticized Saudi Arabia in front of his notably uncomfortable colleagues, Reps. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., and Michael McCaul, R-Texas. He called Wahhabism, the state-backed conservative Islamic movement in Saudi Arabia, “the greatest exporter” of extremist ideology, a message that seemed at odds with the conference’s top-line themes.","Correction: October 26, 2017An earlier version of this story misattributed a quote to Hudson Institute press secretary Carolyn Stewart. The quote was from Hudson head of public affairs David Tell.","Top photo: Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist and chair of Breitbart News, is displayed on a camera as he speaks during a discussion on countering violent extremism on Oct. 23, 2017, in Washington.","We depend on the support of readers like you to help keep our nonprofit newsroom strong and independent.

In a statement issued on March 26, FTC Consumer Protection Bureau Acting Director Tom Pahl said that the FTC \"takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.\"","The FTC investigation will likely focus on what data Facebook shares with third parties. But third parties aren't the only entity hoping to win \"friends\" and influence people on this social platform. Facebook collects a great deal of information about users for use by its internal algorithms. Those algorithms govern who and what users see, whom they get recommended to \"friend,\" and other aspects of how our Facebook experiences are subtly (or sometimes not-so-subtly) shaped by advertisers and others leveraging the platform.","As Ars reported, Facebook has pushed users to allow access to SMS messages and call logs with its Messenger and Facebook Lite applications under the auspices of providing a service. \"Keep up with all your conversations in one place\" by using the app as the default SMS application on Android phones, Facebook offers. Previous versions of the Facebook mobile app on Android (in versions of Android prior to 4.1) were able to read SMS and call logs simply by asking for access to contacts, which Facebook has described as standard practice for applications. This allowed Facebook to keep track of the time, length, and contact information for any call made or received by the Android device by uploading it to Facebook's data centers. Facebook could also access metadata about text and multimedia messages sent via SMS.","Further Reading","Facebook asserts that it does all of this tracking with users' consent. The requests given for that consent, however, may be confusing and misleading, though they have become more explicit over the last two years.","Enlarge/ This is how Facebook Messenger asks to gain access to your contacts, SMS, and phone call logs now. It's not obvious that call logs are part of either of these asks.","Tinfoil hats not required","Some Facebook users have said that Facebook did more than just collect metadata from messages. Multiple individuals recounted to Ars occasions when they had the content of text message conversations nearly immediately affect advertisements they were shown on Facebook. These users say they saw ads that were specific to locations or services that were discussed via SMS, but those subjects were never the focus of Facebook posts or other Facebook content.","Facebook probably doesn't need to go that far. Much of that coincidence is derived from the power of Facebook's \"social graph\" database and the technology Facebook developed to power its search features. Graph databases link \"entities\" (people, products, interests, locations) with relationships, making it possible for algorithms to crawl down the connections between different entities to uncover hidden potential affinities or relationships. And features like plugging into call and SMS data, SMS text flow, data from sites carrying Facebook-hosted advertisements or \"like\" and \"share\" buttons, and location data from mobile allow Facebook to make those sorts of connections dynamically, in near-real time.","Those sorts of connections aren't obvious to users who download archives of their Facebook data, but they are certainly suggested by parts of it. The \"Ads Topics\" data that was in my personal Facebook archive included very specific terms linked to my pattern of life: specific people I have interacted with, services I have looked at websites related to (\"Kitchen\" is a recent high-scoring one, thanks to searches related to remodeling plans), places I have visited or may be interested in, and organizations I either have an affiliation with or a research interest in.","These could be valuable to all sorts of organizations, including nation-states; my Ads Topics of \"Noam Chomsky,\" \"North Korea,\" \"US Department of Defense,\" and the New York City and Baltimore Police Departments could be interpreted in all sorts of ways when taken together, for example.","Google collects similar data on users. You can relive your travels courtesy of Google Timeline with sometimes disconcerting fidelity: all the places you've gone with your Android phone, the routes you took, the photos you took along the way in a handy Google Maps format. Google's algorithms and cookies follow your searches and page visits to sites with Google and Doubleclick advertisements, and the bots that used to read the contents of your emails to deliver the targeted advertisements that pay for those services (Google has discontinued that practice).","All of this data is collected, as with Facebook's collection, with your implied permission. And as with Facebook, the raw data is not directly readable by third parties (other than law enforcement agencies).","But the data Google collects contains significantly less direct and inferred information about an individual's relationships, affiliations, activities, and intents. While Google has an entity database technology of its own among other \"big data\" systems used as part of its search and advertising services, it has not yet applied that power in a way that mirrors Facebook's global social graph.","So, it's important to remember one underlying truth when using any of these \"free\" services owned by Google, Facebook, Snap, Twitter, and the like: we users are not their customers; we're their product.","Sean Gallagher\nSean is Ars Technica's IT and National Security Editor.

Then she bragged about it on Facebook, saying she had warned the victim and his co-worker, “Don’t make me spank you,” authorities said.","Middlesex District Attorney Marian T. Ryan said it appeared to be a “random encounter in traffic” and “possible road rage” that led to the shooting of Marc Devoe, 34, of Peabody.","Paulino appeared Friday morning in Lowell District Court wearing a hooded sweatshirt and stood hunched over, trying to hide her face, during her arraignment. She was held without bail, and her case was continued to March 14.","According to a police report filed in court, the shooting occurred around 12:39 p.m. Thursday. Devoe’s co-worker, Brian Daigle, told police that he and Devoe were working construction jobs at the mill building near the Lowell Regional Transit Authority terminal, and went to pick up lunch. On the way back, Devoe “may have cut off” a car at the intersection of Gorham and Moore streets, Daigle said.","Daigle told police he then heard Devoe say, “Someone is following us . . . the kid is following us.”","When they got closer to the construction site, Devoe looked at the car behind them and said: “Someone is following us . . . I think we have a problem,” Daigle told police.","When the two men drove into a lot near the train station, the vehicle pulled up next to them. Daigle said he and Devoe got out and confronted the lone driver, later identified as Paulino.","Daigle said an argument ensued, and Devoe and Paulino “were yelling back and forth at each other.”","Daigle said he noticed Paulino reach to the left side of her waistband, and Daigle said, “C’mon, forget it, it’s just a girl,” and he and Devoe got back into their vehicle and drove away.","Daigle said they saw Paulino was following them again. Daigle said Devoe pulled over to the right side of the road and got out under the Hale Street Bridge. As Paulino drove past, Daigle told police, her car slowed down, and he heard a gunshot.","Daigle told police he saw a blood spot in the middle of Devoe’s chest. “I’ve been hit,” Devoe said. He climbed back into the driver’s seat and sped off after Paulino, until he lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a Jersey barrier. Devoe then got out of the car and collapsed, the report states.","Devoe was taken to Lowell General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Less than two hours after the shooting, an ominous post appeared on Paulino’s Facebook page, apparently referring to the deadly encounter: “Tried to warn Em tried to tell Em told Em stop that you my son don’t make me spank you.”","Police noted the Facebook post in their report and used that information and witness interviews to request a warrant charging Paulino with murder.","It is not the first time Paulino has been in trouble with the law.","In July 2017, she was charged with resisting arrest, possession of a Class D drug, assault and battery, assault with a dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct. She also faced several charges stemming from an incident on Oct. 31, 2015, including illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition, but those charges were dismissed, according to the Lowell District Court clerk’s office.","17 thoughts on “‘DREAMER’ Shot Man To Death In Road-Rage Incident, Bragged About It On Facebook”","Yes, dismiss all charges against all precious dreamers, forevermore. They should never be held to account for anything. We all know the best way to encourage rotten, deadly behavior is to throw out all laws. They (and all American born druggies) will have the entire country destroyed before the next generation.","Were is the police and FBI her Facebook was full of stuff, the site should investigate before she killed that man . Parents of the person that was killed need to buried there son and demand that in Massachusetts all illegal aliens be deported.","The Democrats are traitors anyone who supports Open Borers and oppose a border fence are partners with these crinimals and that means all Sanctuary Cities and their mayors and city councils actvists judges and Moonbeam Brown","Ligaya Fabian aka Ligaya Sibug of 1631 El Camino Real #8 Tustin Ca 92780 submitted fake documents and paid money to obtain a driver’s license but the dmv found out and revoked the license.

According to Massachusetts’s radical leftist Attorney General, Maura Healey, we need to protect “dreamers” and other illegal aliens, keep firearms out of the hands of licensed, trained, law-abiding American citizens, and sue the President and the oil companies.","Maura Healey, you are making our state sick.

Did I work with Cambridge Analytica at any point? Can you make sure?","Carolyn Everson, Facebook's vice president of global marketing solutions says she has spent the past week contacting thousands of the company's advertisers, helping them understand the ramifications of the ongoing Cambridge Analytica mess. She started by notifying Facebook's client council, which is made up of several top marketing executives, last Saturday.","Most advertisers want to hear directly about what steps Facebook is taking to protect consumer data. But some, according to Everson, have a more urgent question. \"Do you know if we worked with Cambridge Analytica?'\"","Everson told Business Insider that some advertisers are asking for assurance that they have not directly or inadvertently worked with the company, which is accused of using data from 50 million Facebook users without permission.","Cambridge Analytica is associated with its work on the Trump campaign. But Ad Age reported that the company has more recently pitched its psychographic ad targeting services to other brands, including the US Army.","Everson said Facebook doesn't know who may or may not have worked with Cambridge. \"We are trying to pull that together as we speak,\" she said.","For the most part, the average Facebook advertiser will be unaffected by the Cambridge fiasco. Day-to-day most advertisers have relied on Facebook data for their ad targeting, not data collected by third party apps. And for brands that may have once used data from these kinds of apps, they likely would have stopped around 2015 when Facebook changed the rules to restrict the kind of data collection at issue.","The exception would be if a marketer had previously built its own app that collected users' friends data like Cambridge did prior to Facebook's rule changes. That's something Facebook is trying to get a handle on as it audits all third party apps, Everson said.","\"If they created an app and collected friend data and didn't destroy it, there would be a problem,\" she said.","Yet for the most part brands primarily use the demographic data provided by Facebook (people's self reported ages, sex, location, etc.) for ad targeting and none of that has changed.","\"Advertisers care deeply about people,\" Everson said. \"If people are upset, advertisers are upset. What they care about most is, how you react. That is what they are watching. They don't expect you to be perfect.\"","The meshes with what one top ad buying executive told Business Insider. The challenge for Facebook, he said, is longer term.","Everson sees this crisis as providing Facebook a chance to become a leader in data privacy protection. \"It's on us,\" she said. \" We have to work incredibly hard to rebuild trust where we've lost it. It's our job and it's our problem.\"","Facebook will make sure its 2 billion plus users know how it's handing this problem by explaining its actions on data \"front and center in people's news feeds,\" Everson said. \"We need to really ensure frequency of message, and not assume that all people are reading the news. This is going to be an ongoing effort for us.\"","\"We really want to set a totally new standard for data and privacy,\" she said. \"This is a defining moment for the company and the future of the entire industry.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-24"}

It appears the information was harvested by a researcher who collected data not only on the 270,000 or so users who Facebook said took his survey but also on their friends, who knew nothing about the survey, and then passed it to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook’s terms of service. There are questions now over whether the data was destroyed.","Facebook waited more than two years before revealing what the Observer described as “unprecedented data harvesting”.","Facebook did not notify the affected users, as may be required by its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).","Cambridge Analytica appears to have used the profiles to develop techniques for influencing voters.","The company has denied wrongdoing, saying “no data from [the researcher] was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign”. But there are questions over whether the Trump campaign appears nonetheless to have gained an advantage in the election from the data.","The Observer report contradicts Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, who said the company did not have Facebook data. Facebook waited more than two years after they discovered the breach before suspending Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The New York Times reported that at least some of the data is still available on the internet.","Cambridge Analytica has denied inappropriate use of Facebook user profiles, but a former employee who is now a whistleblower has emphatically contradicted that claim.","Facebook now has 2.1bn active users, 1.4bn of whom use the site every day. As a social networking platform, it enables people to share ideas, photos and life events with friends, which collectively gives Facebook the highest-resolution image of every user of any media company, with an emphasis on emotions.","For advertisers, Facebook is exceptional for its ability to target more than half of all the people in every developed market and the power it gives to advertisers. On Facebook, advertisers can buy the equivalent of the Super Bowl audience – or any other audience – any day of the year.","Five years ago, researchers hypothesized that Facebook algorithms could be used to predict things like product and political preferences from just a handful of “likes”. Those researchers were concerned about the privacy implications, in part because the default Facebook setting for likes was “public”.","Cambridge Analytica thought it could transform US politics by exploiting that insight.","It was not just the user's profile data that was harvested, but also that of their friends, none of whom were notified","With the 2016 election cycle fast approaching, Cambridge Analytica did not have time to create its own custom profiles. So it went to researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who created a Facebook app that paid users to take a personality test.","There were problems with this arrangement. First, Kogan did not have permission from Facebook to use the data he gathered for commercial purposes, which best characterizes his Cambridge Analytica relationship. Second, the app not only harvested user profile data – which could be compared with the results of the personality test – but also the user profile data of each test taker’s friends, none of whom were notified.","Was any of this illegal? Facebook may be liable for a data breach, which may create legal problems under state law. The attorney general of Massachusetts has announced an investigation. Cambridge Analytica may face charges that it broke US election laws by employing people who were neither US citizens nor green card holders on a US presidential election campaign. Both may be subject to action by the FTC. Or perhaps not.","We live in a world of big data, where companies get rich off our personal information with few constraints and almost no supervision. Companies offer us free applications that are convenient, useful and fun in exchange for perpetual rights to the data they can harvest from our actions online (and sometimes offline).","The big data companies are opaque to consumers and regulators alike, so few people understand the risks and companies can often hide data breaches for a long time. US law provides very little privacy protection, leaving consumers with little or no recourse when they are harmed.","It is past time that the US recognize that data is too important to be unregulated.

But Cambridge Analytica shouldn’t act as a diversion from the real bad guy in this story: Facebook. It is mystifying that as his company regulates the flow of information to billions of human beings, encouraging certain purchasing habits and opinions, and monitoring people’s interactions, Mark Zuckerberg is invited to give lectures at Harvard without being treated with due scepticism.","We have now reached the point where an unaccountable private corporation is holding detailed data on over a quarter of the world’s population. Zuckerberg and his company have been avoiding responsibility for some time. Governments everywhere need to get serious in how they deal with Facebook.","After trolls were sent to jail for sending threatening messages to the activist Caroline Criado-Perez and MP Stella Creasy, a debate ensued over whether the likes of Facebook and Twitter should be classified as platforms or publishers. Facebook is treated as if it is simply a conduit for information, meaning it is not liable for the content its users share – in the same way that BT can’t be sued when people make threatening phone calls.","In 2014 Iain MacKenzie, a spokesperson for Facebook, said, “Every piece of content on Facebook has an associated ‘report’ option that escalates it to your user operations team for review. Additionally, individuals can block anyone who is harassing them, ensuring they will be unable to interact further. Facebook tackles malicious behaviour through a combination of social mechanisms and technological solutions appropriate for a mass-scale online opportunity.”","But the company is evasive about the number of moderators it employs, how they work, and how decisions are made. It has started taking a firmer line on far-right content – recently removing Britain First pages from the site – but it is still resisting many legislative attempts to regulate its content. What content users then see is decided by an algorithm that can change without any consultation, including with the government or the businesses that rely on Facebook for revenue – meaning that some can be quickly wiped off the map. In February 2018 the website Digiday reported on LittleThings, a four-year-old site that shut down overnight after Facebook decided to prioritise user posts over publisher content. A hundred jobs were lost.","Facebook wasn’t the only contributor to LittleThings’ demise, but those working at the website said there was nowhere else to go after the algorithm change. And this isn’t the only example: in 2013 an algorithm change halved the traffic of viral content website Upworthy – something from which the website has never recovered.","The impact of Facebook’s dominance means that publications are constantly scrambling to keep up with the platform’s changing strategy. The editor-in-chief of Wired, Nick Thompson, recently told the Digiday podcast that there was a fear “Facebook has a dial somewhere that can be turned to cut off media that gets too uppity”.","Much has been made of the fact that Facebook creates “filter bubbles”. It has been criticised for prioritising content that users will like – meaning there is less diversity in the news stories people read – and for failing to crack down on propaganda. In fact, Italy’s new far-right star Matteo Salvini explicitly thanked Facebook for contributing to the country’s recent election results.","All this from a company that in 2016 paid just £5.1m in corporation tax on its UK operations, despite profit and revenues nearly quadrupling on the back of increased advertising sales. In December 2017, Facebook announced it would start booking advertising revenue in countries where it was earned, instead of rerouting it via Ireland, although – as this newspaper reported – the move is “unlikely to result in it paying much more tax”. This is despite Zuckerberg calling for governments to start paying a universal basic income for every citizen as a response to automation, driven in part by Silicon Valley.","Even if we want to avoid the site and keep our data protected, it’s not as easy as one might think. According to Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook, the company uses techniques found in propaganda and casino gambling to foster psychological addiction in its users – such as constant notifications and variable rewards. By keeping us hooked, Facebook is able to hold a huge amount of data on us. What is surprising, and worrying, is the derived data Facebook has – the profiles it can build of its users based on seemingly innocuous information. The author of the book Networks of Control, Wolfie Christl, noted that a patent published by Facebook works out people’s commute times by using location data from mobile apps. It then uses this and other data to segregate users into social classes.","Facebook’s massive data cache goes hand in hand with its acquisition of competitors. Nick Srnicek, author of Platform Capitalism, says, “Facebook is acting like a classic monopoly: it’s buying up competitors like Instagram, it’s blatantly copying rivals like Snapchat, and it even has its own app, Onavo, that acts to warn them of potential threats. All of this is combined with an unchecked sweeping up of our data that’s being used to build an impervious moat around its business.”","If ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence. So perhaps it’s time to start treating Facebook as the giant multinational corporation it is – especially because people with Facebook profiles aren’t the company’s customers: they are the product it sells to advertisers."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Backed by other employees as well as documentation, Wylie has exposed Cambridge Analytica as having illegally stolen data from millions of Facebook accounts in order to influence the 2016 presidential elections.","‘The firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.’","In this piece, first published shortly after Donald Trump was elected president, writer McKenzie Funk challenged Facebook to do something about a firm that helped him win, Cambridge Analytica. Sixteen months later, Facebook has banned them. https://t.co/2oecalLUIR","The firm was backed by an investment of $15 million dollars from Trump supporter and Breitbart owner Robert Mercer, who was a crucial part of Trump’s election. Wylie explained the reasoning behind the alleged illegal activity.","‘They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.’","Previous reporting by The Wall Street Journal exposed Cambridge Analytica for their contacts with Julian Assange, whose role in the 2016 elections cannot be understated. Assange used Wikileaks to reveal thousands of hacked emails from the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, a move that irreparably damaged Trump’s political rival, Hillary Clinton.","‘The chief executive of a data-analytics firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s campaign reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to offer help organizing the Hillary Clinton-related emails the website was releasing, according to a person familiar with the effort.’","Assange’s communications with longtime friend and informal campaign adviser, Roger Stone, were exposed by The Washington Post after Stone denied the communications to the House Intelligence Committee, saying that he only communicated with Wikileaks through an intermediary. Stone had said previously stated in interviews and at campaign events that he was in contact with Assange during the elections and suspiciously tweeted about Podesta’s upcoming “time in the barrel” several days prior to the emails’ release.","Facebook has now suspended the firm from the social media platform. The New York Times reported a statement made by top executives at Facebook.","‘”This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.’","We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies.

The updates also coincide with sweeping new privacy laws, which require more specific and simplified disclosures to consumers, that are due to go into effect in Europe in May.","“The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, wrote in the blog post. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.”","Facebook said it did not implement the changes entirely because of Cambridge Analytica — and wasn’t motivated solely by Europe’s new data protection rules, either. But Rob Sherman, the company’s deputy chief privacy officer, acknowledged in an interview that the company must repair its relationship with users.","“People aren’t going to trust Facebook, they’re not going to be comfortable using it, if we’re not an ethical steward of data,” he said. “I think, certainly, what’s clear over the past week or so is that we’ve lost a lot of trust and we have to do some work to regain it, and that’s something I think all of us at Facebook have internalized and are working really hard to do.”","The changes Facebook announced Wednesday primarily redesign and streamline already-existing features. The social network already gives consumers the ability to download their data and control many privacy settings, albeit in a confusing way.","Nate Cardozo, senior staff attorney at the privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that Facebook’s design changes were a start, but did not address deep needs for consumers. For instance, he said, Facebook does not let people remove their data from the company’s servers. “Facebook has gone one tenth of the way toward restoring public trust here,” he said.","But research has shown that changes in design, sometimes called privacy nudges, can affect people's behavior, said Lorrie Cranor, director of the Cylab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s former chief technologist.","A 2010 study by Cranor and other Carnegie Mellon researchers found that people tend to comprehend simpler privacy policies better than long, complicated ones. The study, which included 764 participants and followed a format for privacy policies modeled after a nutrition label, also found that people got through simpler policies more quickly and were less frustrated by the experience.","Alessandro Acquisti, a Carnegie Mellon computer scientist who also co-authored the privacy study, said that Facebook’s controls had gotten more and more complex over the years in response to a series of privacy scandals. He applauded the streamlined changes, but said that overall they were akin to “putting lipstick on a pig” because Facebook’s underlying approach to user protecting user data was “ultimately broken, and today’s changes are not fixing that.”","Another big concern, he said, is whether Facebook’s default settings continue to encourage consumers to share large amounts of data. Researchers, he said, have long documented what is known as status quo bias, in which consumers are very unlikely to switch or opt out of the default mode that companies lay out for them.","The announcements come as Facebook weathers a barrage of unprecedented regulatory scrutiny. In the United States, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been asked to testify before three congressional committees investigating the Cambridge Analytica controversy, and he’s expected to submit to questioning by at least one of those panels. Similar probes are underway throughout Europe, including the United Kingdom, where lawmakers plan to grill Chris Cox, the chief product officer of Facebook, at a hearing next month.","European regulators have been especially critical of Facebook in recent weeks. Months from now, the European Union is set to begin enforcing a new set of tough privacy and data protection laws that require tech giants to be more forthcoming about the information they collect and why.","Appearing at a major industry conference in Washington, D.C. this week, some of those officials stressed that Facebook needs to learn from its mistakes.","“I think if Facebook would have spent 10 percent of this money on data protection issues, maybe the loss wouldn’t have been,” she said.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

The result could be a hearing that exposes both of those tech giants – whose data is not known to have been taken by Cambridge Analytica – to uncomfortable questions about the extent to which they profit from their users’ most personal data, too.","A spokesman for Zuckerberg, who last week expressed his openness to appear at a hearing, said Facebook is still reviewing the request. A spokeswoman for Twitter declined comment. Spokespeople for Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The hearing is hardly the only major political and legal challenge facing Facebook. Earlier Monday, a powerful US watchdog agency, the Federal Trade Commission, said it would investigate Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica incident, a probe that carries the potential for steep fines and other penalties on the social giant.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” Tom Pahl, the acting director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement Monday. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","For its part, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Friday that it had obtained data from the social network “in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws.”","The Senate Judiciary Committee, however, could prove to be the toughest political territory for Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers. Lawmakers there have been seething over Facebook, Google and Twitter since last fall, when the panel grilled those tech giants’ lawyers about another issue – Russian propaganda that spread on their platforms around the 2016 election.","Questions about Trump, the Russian government’s disinformation efforts and the presidential race are likely to return at the scheduled April 10 session – on top of new, uncomfortable queries about the ways that the biggest brands in the tech industry collect and protect information about their users. Some of the Judiciary Committee’s members, including Republican Senator John Kennedy and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal are tough, regular critics of the tech industry’s privacy practices.","For now, the session is set to “broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” the committee announced Monday. “It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Meanwhile, the FTC’s probe comes as another blow to the social network.","While the FTC normally refuses to comment on its probes, it took the unusual step of confirming the “non-public investigation” into Facebook over whether it mishandled private data or violated a 2011 agreement which settled an earlier probe.","It threatened “enforcement action against companies that fail to honour their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield (a US-EU privacy accord), or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act.”","The FTC suggested that Facebook could face new legal problems if it violated the consent decree with the consumer agency in 2011 settling charges that it deceived consumers on how it handled private data.","“Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,” Pahl said in the statement.","A public apology by Zuckerberg has failed to quell outrage over the hijacking of personal data.","Separately, Facebook disputed reports that it had been logging call and text data surreptitiously from its users.","A Facebook statement said call and text history logging “is part of an opt-in feature” for those using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android.","“This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook,” the statement said, while pointing to ways users can turn off the feature."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly “legitimate way and through proper channels” when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie.","Kogan’s app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Advertisement - story continues below","It seems that Facebook allowed Kogan’s app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as “likes,” because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators. Kogan was reportedly able to create more than 50 million profiles using the trend and characteristics data before providing them to Cambridge.","“Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” Wylie said of Cambridge, according to The New York Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Do you think this company helped Trump win the election as Facebook claims?","YesNo","Completing this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.","You're logged in to Facebook. Click here to log out.","Tech companies like Google, Twitter, and especially Facebook, have been hammered with criticism from a large portion of the population — including lawmakers — for purportedly helping Trump win the 2016 election with the platform’s inherent offerings.","How much social media campaigns actually had an effect on election results appears dubious, or at least unclear, and may not even be quantifiable. What is more clear is that Facebook’s features can help sow seeds of further discord by allowing operators to capitalize on polarization.","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology, said in a statement. “While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways.”","Advertisement - story continues below","Severalreports, including The New York Times’ one, are referring to the actions of Cambridge Analytica — which had social media prowess described as the “secret sauce” to Trump’s political campaign — as a data “breach.”","But as noted by Grewal in an update made Saturday morning, “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false” because Kogan requested and gained access through permissible, in fact, standard, means. “Everyone involved gave their consent,” said Grewal.","Facebook says it is subjecting all apps that seek personal user information to its App Review process, “which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.”","Founded by Tucker Carlson, a 25-year veteran of print and broadcast media, and Neil Patel, former chief policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, The Daily Caller News Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit providing original investigative reporting from a team of professional reporters that operates for the public benefit."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Today, the “data economy” is an important market for collection, extraction, refining and monetization. While only a defined quantity of oil exists, data constantly generates more data due to the exponential growth of interactions and digital communications. A recent IBM study confirms this: 90% of the available data has been produced in the past two years.","Amongst the different types of data (business data, those derived from sensors, etc.), personal data includes all those that directly concern an individual; they cover multiple dimensions such as: identity, origin, physical or mental characteristics, health, genetic data, family, activities and travel, emails and online purchases, social interactions, assets, its connections, etc. In short, a kind of virtual digital representation of the individual.","For the past twenty years, the main websites, social networks, major digital media, e-merchants, etc. can follow each user during his online journey, via cookies (that is to say files deposited by a website on a computer), via a unique identifier or an IP address. Mobile phones, activity bracelets and soon personal assistants at home complete this data collection in the physical world.","The giants Facebook or Google offer free online services and a very profitable business model through the collection of personal data, compiled and crossed to be used for targeted marketing and advertising campaigns sold to advertisers. The personal data thus collected allows anonymous profiling and in some cases, to reveal the person’s identity. Internet users then lose, sometimes without even knowing it (except if you decide to read the hundreds of pages of terms of service), the control of their personal data.","At the beginning of 2018 Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, had just acknowledged that large technology companies (he does not quote his own) use technology to monitor users and that governments do the same for citizens. Taking the initiative of remedying to this situation, he presents two technologies, data encryption and cryptocurrency, as means of “rendering the power back to the individuals”.","Given the quick pace of technological changes and its fast-growing uses, we believe that it is neither a question of prohibiting the collection of data by companies, nor of encouraging the user to systematically monetize his data. In the future, free online services monetizing personal data may become worthwhile. But until then, startups offer innovative products that give everyone the control of their own data (management tools and monetization) and diversify their uses by ensuring its consent (digital identity tool). They combine the easy to use for mass adoption (such as the personal cloud) with a secure encryption for controlled and more responsible use (secure communication tools, Blockchain tools).","2018, a milestone year for the protection of personal data","As of May 2018, the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be applicable in all EU Member States and, by extension, to all companies, including those outside Europe, that process data from EU citizens. According to the legislator, any natural person can therefore take control of his personal data.","Amongst the main measures of the GDPR are the following obligations:","Include the protection of personal data from the design of a product or service (privacy by design) collection or protection,","Keep a record of all personal data processing,","Obtain the informed consent of each user for the processing of their data,","Grant the user a “right to be forgotten” (ie if the user asks for it, his data must be totally erased)","Add a data portability, so that everyone can receive from any operator or platform all of his personal data in his possession in order to compete or monetize his profile,","Notify users of any violations of the stored data and any incident concerning them.","Although it is too early to know the real impact of this new regulation, it is likely that this will lead to a large-scale awareness by European Internet users concerning how their data is used. Users will want to control it better and will see new personalized products and services appear.","From centralization to decentralization of personal data","For the user, the storage of his personal data by companies has two disadvantages:","Any change request must be repeated with each company","Centralization favors the risks of computer attacks (those targeting Yahoo, Equifax, Target, Home Depot, Sony, … have had costly economic consequences) and the spread of personal data in the Dark Web.","These disadvantages can be addressed by decentralizing the storage of personal data, managed directly by the user and disseminated with his consent. Technical solutions such as cryptocurrency or private blockchain are emerging technologies that could provide a decentralized database architecture.","100 European startups to regain control of their data","It is in a favorable legal context in Europe and a collective awareness around personal data that we have identified 100 top performing European startups that provide concrete and original solutions for easy, efficient and secure personal data management.","Amongst the startups that manage personal data for individuals, by category:"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-14"}

According to the report that followed the investigation, Backpage.com knowingly facilitated online child sex trafficking on the “adult” section of its website. It did this by filtering the text of advertisements to delete keywords like “rape”, “amber alert”, “little girl” and “lolita” before posting them to conceal the true intent of the ads.","Backpage.com did not remove these ads or report them to police.","“If enacted, it will establish some measure of accountability for those that cynically sell advertising but are unprepared to help curtail sex trafficking,” said Oracle senior vice-president Kenneth Glueck in a letter to Portman and Blumenthal.","In an op-ed published Thursday, Portman cited statistics from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children that showed an 846% increase in reports of child sex trafficking to its “CyberTipline” from 2010 to 2015. Backpage.com accounts for 73% of all child trafficking reports from the public, according to the same organization.","“Unbelievably, federal law has protected its unscrupulous business practices,” Portman wrote.","He said the protections in the Communications Decency Act “were never intended to apply – and they should not apply – to companies that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking. It’s time for this 21-year-old law to be updated for the 21st century.”","The tech industry and some free-speech advocates say that the sex trafficking bill paves the way to broadly and unduly hold companies responsible for user-generated content.","In an email seen by the Guardian, Google public policy counsel Stewart Jeffries described the act as “controversial legislation” that undercuts “one of the foundational statutes for the internet”, referring to CDA 230. He also pointed to work Google has done to combat human trafficking, including blocking sites like Backpage.com from advertising and getting its engineers to develop a tool that scans online ads to flag possible child victims for anti-exploitation charity Thorn.","The Internet Association, which represents Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter, penned a letter along with other trade groups to Portman and Blumenthal arguing that while “rogue actors” like Backpage.com should be held accountable, the sex trafficking bill “would severely undermine a crucial protection for legitimate online companies, and would be counterproductive to those companies’ efforts to combat trafficking crimes”.","“CDA 230 is a bedrock legal protection for online services,” the letter stated. “Without this crucial protection, these service providers would be forced to err on the side of removing their users’ content or face unsustainable liability for their users’ content that would harm the creation of legitimate diverse online services.”","Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Senator Portman, told the Guardian the tech community’s claims were “absurd and laughable”.","“We did our due diligence, met with the tech community on a bipartisan basis for months and yet they offered no constructive feedback,” he said. “It’s sad that these folks would oppose a bipartisan, two-page bill to help stop online sex trafficking of women and children.”","“This is not a free speech issue, this is a crime issue,” said Taina Bien-Aimé, executive director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women. “The internet has become a very easy tool with very low risk and very high profits in illegal activities in the sale and purchase of vulnerable young women.”","Small ads sex trafficking: the battle against Backpage","The legislation has 28 co-sponsors from both the left and the right, a rare bipartisan display in Washington.","Last month, 50 attorneys general from states and US territories signed a letter backing efforts to amend the CDA so that they could prosecute companies that support, facilitate or assist online sex trafficking.","Support for the bill has intensified in recent days, with public figures including comedian Amy Schumer and former UN ambassador Samantha Power urging members of the public to endorse it.","A source familiar with the discussions between the tech community and Capitol Hill supporters of the bill said the fight was emblematic of the growing prominence of Silicon Valley.","“There is a certain level of arrogance here, where many in the broader tech community believe they are untouchable,” the source said. “Their bottom line comes before anything else, even commonsense efforts to rein in online sex trafficking.”"],"isopubdate":"2017-09-07"}

(Thomas Peter/Reuters)","By John Pomfret","March 27","When a woman walked to work this month in the bustling Southern Chinese metropolis of Shenzhen, she, like many millions of other Chinese, jaywalked, cutting across a side street to avoid a detour of hundreds of yards to a crosswalk. What happened next, as documented by the woman, a writer calling herself Mao Yan, was an illustration of a brave new world being born in China.","Two traffic policemen approached the woman and told her that she had violated the traffic regulations of the People’s Republic of China. Eager to get to her job, Mao Yan apologized and pointed out that there was no fencing to block jaywalkers like her. She hoped to get off with a verbal warning. The officers, however, were intent on prosecution. They demanded her identity card, which is issued to all Chinese citizens. When Mao Yan said that she had not brought hers, they asked for her ID number. When she said she had not memorized it, one officer snapped her picture with a camera phone. Seconds later he read out her name, her ID card number and date of birth. Using facial recognition technology, he had identified Mao Yan.","Then Mao Yan heard the clatter of a printer from a nearby police kiosk. One of the officers entered the kiosk and returned with a slip. “It was my first ever traffic citation,” Mao Yan wrote. On the citation was a QR code that she scanned to pay her fine via a messaging app called WeChat that is managed by Tencent, a private Chinese company.","Mao Yan was taken aback by the experience and what she called “the stunning efficiency of the facial recognition technology possessed by our traffic police.” She shared her story with friends, who told her she was lucky that she had not crossed against a light. If she had, police could have put her face, her full name and several digits of her ID card number on a public bulletin board for everyone to see. “Jaywalkers have fewer rights than criminal suspects,” she wrote, pointing out that in Chinese news reports, suspects are often not fully identified and their faces are blotted out.","Mao Yan’s Shenzhen is part of one of the great social experiments of mankind — the use of massive amounts of data, combined with facial recognition technology, shaming and artificial intelligence to control a population via marriage of the state and private companies. Already on the packed highways of Shanghai, honking has decreased. That’s because directional microphones coupled with high-definition cameras can identify and ticket — again, via WeChat — noisy drivers and display their names, photographs and identity card numbers on the city’s many LED boards. On some streets, if drivers stop their cars by the side of the road longer than seven minutes, high-definition cameras identify the driver and, again, issue him or her an instant ticket.","In other parts of China the technology is being used by the state security apparatus to crack down on separatism. In Xinjiang, which has been the site of a separatist movement against Chinese rule, China’s police have established a 21st-century police state through an infrastructure of security technology with high-definition cameras, facial-recognition technology, iris and body scanners at checkpoints, the forced collection of DNA, and the mandatory use of apps that monitor messages on smartphones. The focus of this campaign is the Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic group that is mostly Muslim.","But as Mao Yan’s story makes clear, this technology is bleeding into the rest of China, where 95 percent of the population is Han Chinese. And China’s authorities won’t be content with traffic stops. Their goal is behavioral modification on a massive scale. Chinese planners have announced their intention to tap the vast AI and surveillance infrastructure currently under construction to generate “social credit” scores for all of China’s 1.5 billion people. With a high score, traveling, securing a loan, buying a car and other benefits will be easy to come by. Run afoul of the authorities, and problems begin.","Some Chinese businessmen who are benefiting from this massive investment in data have argued that the Chinese are less concerned about privacy than people in the United States. Robin Li, the founder of Baidu, China’s version of Google, which routinely shares its data with the Chinese Communist Party, argued over the weekend that Chinese people don’t care that much about privacy. “The Chinese people are more open or less sensitive about the privacy issue,” said Li, speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing. “If they are able to trade privacy for convenience, safety and efficiency, in a lot of cases, they are willing to do that.” Ironically, Li’s remarks were released by the Chinese magazine Caixin on the same day that Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology for releasing user data to a political consultancy.","In her article, Mao Yan didn’t seem to agree with Li’s optimistic interpretation of the campaign. “Maybe,” she wrote, “it’s intimidation to make everyone afraid.” I think she’s right. Hours after Mao Yan posted her story on China’s Internet, censors took it down.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","John PomfretJohn Pomfret, a former Washington Post bureau chief in Beijing, is the author of “The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom: America and China, 1776 to the Present.” Follow"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo","Facebook disclosed the issue in a blog post on Friday, hours before media reports that conservative-leaning Cambridge Analytica, a data company known for its work on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was given access to the data and may not have deleted it.","The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which was already under attack over Russians’ alleged use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U.S. elections.","Facebook said the root of the problem was that researchers and Cambridge Analytica lied to it and abused its policies, but critics on Saturday threw blame at Facebook as well, demanding answers on behalf of users and calling for new regulation.","Facebook insisted the data was misused but not stolen, because users gave permission, sparking a debate about what constitutes a hack that must be disclosed to customers.","“The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley’s use of data.","Pasquale said Facebook’s response that data had not technically been stolen seemed to obfuscate the central issue that data was apparently used in a way contrary to the expectations of users.","“It amazes me that they are trying to make this about nomenclature. I guess that’s all they have left,” he said.","Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the “Wild West.”","“Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","With Republicans controlling the Senate’s majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail.","The New York Times and London’s Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted despite Facebook’s demands beginning in 2015.","Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015. The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said.","Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information.","Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action.","Cambridge Analytica in turn said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it.","Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. “We must do better and will,” he wrote on Twitter, adding that “our business depends on it at every level.”","Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied.","Nuala O’Connor, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said Facebook was relying on the good will of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse.","Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday. “That’s a long time,” she said.","Britain’s data protection authority and the Massachusetts attorney general on Saturday said they were launching investigations into the use of Facebook data.","“It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,” UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey’s office said she wants to understand how the data was used, what policies if any were violated and what the legal implications are."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Collecting everything from likes to status updates to personal messages, the company then went on to use this information to create algorithms that would target Facebook users with fake news articles perfectly crafted to insidiously influence political leanings.","In a feature in The Guardian, which has been investigating Cambridge Analytica for a year, reporter Carole Cadwalladr wrote that Wylie described himself as \"the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating 'Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindfuck tool’ ”.","Wylie explains in simple terms how this tactic works and why it is so underhanded. “Instead of standing in the public square and saying what you think, and letting people come and listen to you and have that shared experience as to what your narrative is, you are whispering into the ear of each and every voter, and you may be whispering one thing to this voter and one thing to another voter.\"","Wylie was studying for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting when he came up with the plan to exploit Facebook by creating pyschological profiles and then bombard the users with political ads. “We ‘broke’ Facebook,” he told Cadwalladr.","Wylie also commented on the implications of this practice could have for the future. \"We risk fragmenting society in a way where we don’t have any more shared experiences and we don’t have any more shared understanding.

The same strategies were reportedly used to shift perception in the UKs Brexit vote.","In many ways, the revelations are not all that surprising – ever since the election of Donald Trump, people have been trying to work out how, exactly, it happened - but the direct linkage between Facebook data and the mass-manipulation of society has raised a whole new set of crucial questions. Political leaders are calling for Facebook to come under more scrutiny, officials are saying the company could be subject to hefty fines and the public, more broadly, is no doubt re-considering the amount of trust they place in the network.","Will that lead to fewer people using Facebook? Will we see Facebook come under more regulatory restrictions? And what, exactly, is the extent of what’s possible with Facebook’s data.","Here’s an overview of the implications.","Data Risks","First off, we’ll start with the pressing question – can your Facebook data be used to influence your opinion, without you even realizing?","The answer, undoubtedly, is yes.","Back in 2015, I interviewed Dr. Michal Kosinski, who was part of a research team that had conducted a very similar experiment to the one reportedly manipulated by Cambridge Analytica.","In their study, Kosinski and his team used the results of a hundred question psychological study, which had been completed by more than 86,000 participants through a Facebook-linked app, to map the responses alongside each users’ respective Facebook likes, which were also accessible through the app’s permissions.","Using these insights, the team was able to establish baselines for a range of complex queries – here’s an example from Kosinski:","\"One of our most surprising findings was that we could even predict whether your parents were divorced or not, based on your Facebook likes. Actually, when I saw those results, I started doubting my methods and I re-ran the analyses a few more times. I couldn't believe that what you like on Facebook could be affected by your parents' divorce, which could have happened many years earlier - we're talking here about people who might be 30 or 40 years old.\"","The researchers could accurately predict a wide range of things based on your digital footprint, including whether you were a smoker, your drinking habits, whether you were a drug user, your sexual orientation – according to Kosinski, everything was predictable, to a degree, based on this data.","So how did they do it? The secret is in scale.","Let’s say a person likes both Coca Cola and NFL on Facebook, either by directly liking the Page or interacting with related content in some way. That doesn’t tell you anything, right? One person liking two things is not a trend - you can’t conclude that everyone who likes Coke will also be a fan of the NFL. But on a scale of literally billions of users, and trillions of correlating data points, clear patterns do start to take shape. People who like this thing will also like this, at 80% correlative accuracy. People who are smokers share these traits – which are also shared by this group who reported being non-smokers (but actually are).","People who are more likely to vote for this candidate are most concerned about these issues – you can influence how they vote by targeting them with this type of content.","It may not seem like your basic interactions – your Likes, photos, shares – it doesn’t seem like each of those smaller processes can actually mean that much. But they do, or they can, so long as someone has access to the larger dataset.","This is what Cambridge Analytica reportedly had access to, via an academic who gave them the data. As such, despite the insights they had being recorded back in 2014, they’d still be relevant, and indicative today - that data could still be used to influence voters in 2020 with a large degree of accuracy.","Facebook itself has built its business on the back of the effectiveness of its ad targeting, offering ever-more sophisticated and data-driven options – there’s no doubt that such process can be used to manipulate the public.","And now that members of the public – not to mention regulatory authorities – are becoming more aware of this, what does that mean for Zuck and Co. moving forward?","A History of Queries","This, of course, is not the first time Facebook’s in-depth ad targeting has come under scrutiny.","Facebook has faced a range of questions over its data tools and platform policies - and has even come under regulation, in varying capacity, across regions of Europe. The company has access to more personal insight than any other organization has ever had in history, which is why it’s so incredibly valuable to advertisers, but that capacity also comes with an equally high level of risk, as evident by the Cambridge Analytica case.","Thus far, Facebook has been able to shake off such concerns and continue its forward momentum, but the suggestion that such data can be used to influence elections – potentially putting citizens at massive risk – is something that no one can ignore. Sure, you might be able to shake of specific ad targeting – so what if those Nikes you just looked up are now being pitched to you in a sidebar ad? But knowing that your very thoughts and unconscious leanings are being used against you, that’s something else entirely. Based on the data, you could well be making significant decisions, without even realizing it.","Any platform of Facebook’s size and influence is undoubtedly going to run into such issues at some time. But that’s the thing - there is no other platform of Facebook’s influence, and never has been. Given this, The Social Network is in uncharted territory. That’s not to excuse them for the various mishandlings of such concerns - but really, no one could have handled them. No one’s ever been in the situation that Facebook now finds itself.","On the flip side, no regularity authorities have ever been faced with such a challenge either – there’s simply no way of knowing, for sure, just how much influence Facebook has, and of what the company, or anyone who can access it, can do with its data. It’s clearly powerful; the level of insight could clearly impact people’s actions. But could it really be used to alter your thinking on a critical subject? Can political groups really use this data to change the way we think on a large enough scale to shift culture?","If the latest accusations are correct, then it can - though even then, the actual impacts are impossible to quantify. In which case, should we let Facebook off the hook?","The answers to these questions will play a crucial role in the future considerations for The Social Network, and how it can be used, both by everyday advertisers and academics alike (I’ve asked Facebook if the investigation will lead to further regulation of data on their part, but have received no response).","But then the other key question is ‘are we better off, as a society, without Facebook?’","Will this be the beginning of the end for Zuckerberg’s social behemoth?","Switching Off","On this front, the report couldn’t have come at a worse time for the company.","These new concerns will give users further reason to re-assess their Facebook habits – if people are spending more time in private messaging channels to avoid public over-sharing, the latest revelations will only help further fuel that movement.","Of course, Facebook the company is largely not losing out, as engagement on their various other platforms (Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram) continues to increase in-step. But still, their main platform is where they make the most money, where their ad system is best optimized, and where the most potential still lies.","Facebook can also still harvest data from those channels too, but without intrusive ads, they can’t monetize it in the same way, which, from a perceptual standpoint, makes those apps seem less risky.","It could well be that this latest controversy does the Facebook brand permanent damage, and leads to a re-focus on those other apps moving forward – and that could fundamentally change the social media landscape.","But then again, if history shows us anything it’s that humans are habitual - in all likelihood, people won’t change their social media habits unless they’re forced to. If Facebook comes under further scrutiny and regulation, that too could see a wide scale industry shift, and that seems the more likely scenario, as opposed to users leaving in droves.","But definitely, it does feel like public perception is shifting somewhat. Where that could see particularly significant impact is among younger users – while most adults now have a social routine in place, younger users coming in do not, and they might not look to adopt Facebook so readily, given the controversy. That could see Facebook slowly start to tail off - the first sparks of descent.","It seems incredibly premature to be forecasting the death of a platform that generated some $40 billion in revenue in 2017. But it does feel different this time. The questions are too loud to ignore.","As noted, Facebook may well be able to maneuver the minefield and see things go back to normal, but the perceptual shift feels significant.","The company will be forced to explain itself, beyond its announced investigation into data misuse by Cambridge Analytica, and the answers it provides will be crucial.","This new controversy is going to hurt, no doubt, but how much pain Zuck and Co feel will relate to how well they can respond to the rising roar of concern."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The result could be a hearing that exposes both of those tech giants – whose data is not known to have been taken by Cambridge Analytica – to uncomfortable questions about the extent to which they profit from their users’ most personal data, too.","A spokesman for Zuckerberg, who last week expressed his openness to appear at a hearing, said Facebook is still reviewing the request. A spokeswoman for Twitter declined comment. Spokespeople for Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The Senate’s upcoming hearing is hardly the only major political and legal challenge facing Facebook. Earlier Monday, a powerful U.S. watchdog agency, the Federal Trade Commission, said it would investigate Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica incident. The news initially sent Facebook’s stock price tumbling, though it reversed those losses by the end of the day as the market surged.","For the U.S. government, a key question is whether Facebook's business practices violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over another privacy mishap. As a result, the new probe carries the potential for steep fines and other penalties on the social giant, which is facing similar investigations in Europe.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” Tom Pahl, the acting director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement Monday. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","For its part, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Friday that it had obtained data from the social network “in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws.\"","On Capitol Hill, lawmakers on two panels -- the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee – already have invited Zuckerberg to testify at two upcoming hearings. But lawmakers have not indicated if they would seek to subpoena the Facebook executive if he declined to attend or sought to send another company official in his place.","The Senate Judiciary Committee panel, however, could prove to be the toughest political territory for Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers. Lawmakers there have been seething over Facebook, Google and Twitter since last fall, when the panel grilled those tech giants’ lawyers about another issue – Russian propaganda that spread on their platforms around the 2016 election.","Questions about Trump, the Russian government’s disinformation efforts and the presidential race are likely to return at the scheduled April 10 session – on top of new, uncomfortable queries about the ways that the biggest brands in the tech industry collect and protect information about their users. Some of the Judiciary Committee’s members, including Republican Sen. John Kennedy (La.) and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), are regular critics of the tech industry’s privacy practices.","On Monday, Blumenthal said that federal officials investigating Facebook should be “penetrating and prompt in holding [it] accountable for apparent illegal action.” He even suggested in a statement that “possible remedies should include damage payments to users, and other court-ordered action.”","For now, the Senate Judiciary Committee session is set to “broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” the committee announced Monday. “It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Tony RommTony Romm is a technology policy reporter at The Washington Post.

He said that the so-called psychography profiles combined Facebook data with information gathered from other \"top commercial data providers\" and that data included specific information about voter \"demographics, geographics, purchase history, and interests.\"","When a Facebook user engaged with the survey, he said, the user implicitly gave the company access to a broad spectrum of personal data that Facebook provides for advertisers. The app reached further, giving the company access to profile data from people in the users' broader circle of Facebook friends who had, wittingly or otherwise, set their security setting relatively weakly. Though the company likely did not use a traditional \"hack\" to access user information, they may have violated Facebook's terms of use by bulk harvesting and repurposing user data.","When asked about how the company chose what to include in Facebook surveys, Oczkowski would only say that, it collects data from \"exclusive relationships\" with data vendors \"and through direct response projects.\"","Cambridge Analytica pushed back Saturday against the notion that it harvested any data, insisting it had contracted a firm in the U.K. to do research. Cambridge Analytica insisted that when it learned that it had been sold data it shouldn't have, the firm deleted the data.","Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data. 1/8","\"Inner Demons\"","Getting users to interact with the survey was key to unlocking the data. A source close to the 2016 Trump campaign and familiar with Cambridge Analytica's tactics explained that the surveys used by the company used inflammatory language designed to provoke the \"worst tendencies\" in Facebook users -- meaning that it would stir up the kind of emotion that would prompt an interaction. Cambridge Analytica said Saturday it did not use any Facebook data for the campaign. Mr. Trump's 2016 digital guru, Brad Parscale, told \"60 Minutes\" last year that the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's controversial practice of psychographics.","Cambridge Analytica specializes in psychographics, which microtargets ads based on personality. In the words of whistleblower Christopher Wylie: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons.\"","That allowed the company to scale up their data gathering rapidly. Wired reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN Saturday that by convincing 270,000 people to interact with the app, GSR managed to tap into the data of over 50 million users.","CEO Alexander Nix described the firm as \"fundamentally politically agnostic and an apolitical organization,\" and even tweeted Saturday that President Obama's 2012 \"pioneered microtargeting.\"","But Oczkowski contradicted that assertion, and explained that \"we served as the data agency of record, but our role quickly evolved as the cycle progressed.\"","The company developed \"three pillars\" of exclusive technology, Oczkowski said, including data science and analytics, digital marketing designed for persuasion and get-out-the-vote (GOTV), and polling research. \"Having a large amount of control and input into each of these three areas allowed us to be extremely efficient and reactive,\" he said. \"It also allowed us to easily integrate with the staff at Giles-Parscale and the RNC.\"","When asked specifically how the company leveraged Facebook for other data, Oczkowski explained that the company's data analytics prowess assisted the Trump campaign for everything from resource allocation, calculating the most efficient candidate travel stops, advertising, and the language used in surrogate speeches, and even \"personalizing messaging to the individual voter.\"","\"Huge exaggeration\"","Within GOP data circles, however, the company's extravagant claims about the effectiveness of Facebook data and artificial intelligence are heavily criticized. \"I'm not saying they lied,\" said a former Trumpworld staffer shortly after the election, \"but for Cambridge Analytica to run victory laps and claim they won the election for Trump is a huge exaggeration. Data can do a lot of things, but there's a limit to how effective it is. Cambridge Analytica's claims went far beyond that limit.\"","Cambridge Analytica is not alone in their use of Facebook and social media to target consumers with advertising. Machine learning is one of the fastest growing sectors of business technology, and a number of firms have adopted similar tactics. Amazon, Google, Twitter, and a host of other cloud-based Internet giants are hiring AI experts and building algorithms that automate advertising.","It's no surprise that cloud giants are actively using big data analysis models to aid private industry in everything from cybersecurity to marketing. Oczkowski described the potential application actionable data scraped from Facebook users as potentially \"endless.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

It's no surprise that the data ended up being used again on Facebook, one of the biggest advertising platforms on Earth.","This weekend, while Facebook was quibbling about whether the information used by Cambridge Analytica to target voters in the lead up to the 2016 election was obtained in a data “breach” or somehow using fraudulent means, I decided to check my privacy settings.","Since creating a Facebook in 2006, I have associated my account with 100 separate third party apps. Besides common ones like Spotify, Venmo, and Uber, I have given access to my account to apps like “Typing Maniac,” “I bet I can guess your favorite color,” and “Crazy Cabbie,” among others. Many of these apps I remember only as a faint memory. According to these settings, however, lots of these apps still have access to the same information Cambridge Analytica used to target Facebook users with political ads that helped Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election.","The app was hosted by a company called MetroGames, whose privacy policy notes that the company “may also collect information about the User from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, [and] instant messaging services.” The privacy policy says it shared identifying personal information with third parties only when “permitted by the User” but also said that it used anonymized data regardless of a user’s settings: “We do this primarily for personalizing advertisements and promotions. We regard this as a benefit for the User.”","I do not know what MetroGames—which has gone out of business—ultimately did with my data. But between the hundred apps I’ve given access to my Facebook, there’s a good chance at least one of them has sold my information to data brokers and ultimately used to target me on Facebook and elsewhere. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment for this article.","“You have to proceed on the assumption that this information has been extracted from you,” Woodrow Hartzog, author of Privacy’s Blueprint: The Battle to Control the Design of New Technologies, told me on the phone. “Cambridge Analytica used an information extraction technique that was well-known to technologists for years. The implications of this debacle is about crystallizing the threat about how dangerous the information ecosystem is.”","Just some of the apps that have access to at least some of my information. Image: Jason Koebler/Facebook","The point I am trying to make is that, though Cambridge Analytica’s specific use of user data to help a political campaign is something we haven’t publicly seen on this scale before, it is exactly the type of use that Facebook’s platform is designed for, has facilitated for years, and continues to facilitate every day. At its core, Facebook is an advertising platform that makes almost all of its money because it and the companies that use its platform know so much about you.","Facebook continues to be a financially successful company precisely because its platform has enabled the types of person-specific targeting that Cambridge Analytica did.","Though Facebook technically asks apps not to sell user information to data brokers, researchers say that enforcement is rare and that many fly-by-night companies have historically popped up, gathered information, and then sold that data (or sold the entire company itself) to marketing firms and data brokers. It would be difficult for Facebook to even know this was happening, and many companies would simply be kicked off Facebook once it had already harvested data.","Facebook partners with data brokers to help make its information more effective. Image: Jason Koebler","The way Cambridge Analytica obtained the data of millions of Americans has been done—and in many ways is still being done—by many different data broker firms throughout the United States and the world. The same data that is used every day to sell shoes and meditation apps is used to sell us political candidates, too. Whether Cambridge Analytica misused the data or obtained it in some nefarious way is beside the point—thousands of apps have been used to gather information about millions of Facebook users, and there is little stopping them from selling that data to other people.","“I think there should be concern about other apps engaging in digital strip mining,” Hartzog said. “They create a generic type of app that might be somewhat appealing to users, they get as much information as they can, and they get out. There’s a huge incentive to get the data, and there’s not much penalty for doing it. Not from Facebook and not within our legal structure.”","Cambridge Analytica got much of its data from a Facebook personality test called “thisisyourdigitallife” that was much like many of the games I and millions of other people signed up for years ago. These types of apps were trojan horses to gain access to profiles that could then be resold.","This was not incidental, it was the business model of the apps. I ultimately don’t know if MetroGames sold my data, but many similar apps were created and were eventually purchased by marketing firms and data brokers.","\"People were writing apps manically—photo of the day, quizzes, any sort of garbage people would install so you would have a big user base to take the data. And there were absolutely cases where people developed Facebook apps for fun, got a huge user base, and then sold the apps for hundreds of thousands of dollars to a marketing company.\"","In this way, companies were not technically breaking their privacy policies—by purchasing Facebook app companies, the “third party” data brokers suddenly because the first-party owners of the data. For example, a data analytics company called RapLeaf was caught purchasing user information from various Facebook apps. Facebook eventually shut down RapLeaf, but the company simply sold itself to two data brokers, Acxiom and Tower Data. Today, Acxiom is a “Facebook Marketing Partner” which allows would-be advertisers to supplement that information they already have with the data that Acxiom has already gathered.","“Once Facebook created the [data sharing] API, there was a land grab,” Christo Wilson, a researcher at Northeastern University who has studied Facebook advertising and third-party data sharing tactics, told me on the phone. “People were writing apps manically—photo of the day, quizzes, any sort of garbage people would install so you would have a big user base to take the data. It was a huge market back in the day. And there were absolutely cases where people developed Facebook apps for fun, got a huge user base, and then sold the apps for hundreds of thousands of dollars to a marketing company.”","Granting an app access to your Facebook profile gave it a “token” that could then be used—in many cases indefinitely—by the app to access your data, according to Wilson.","Wilson said that in the course of their research, he and colleague Alan Mislove created apps to determine what types of information could be harvested by data brokers and advertisers; that “thisisyourdigitallife” was nominally created for academic research ultimately has no bearing on what data was collected and how it was ultimately used. Thousands of other apps have harvested the same data.","“You told us you had 100 apps installed—you’re not the only one,” Wilson said. “I have restrictions on my behavior because of things like institutional review, but 99.9 percent of these apps were commercial for the purposes of monetizing people.”","An API change in 2015 made data sharing more restrictive—Facebook no longer allowed apps to take your data simply because your friend had installed an app—but third party apps could still collect data directly from your profile if you gave them permission. And because of the way Facebook’s advertising products work, once data was taken, it remained valuable to data brokers, who collate and compile information for advertisers. Much of the damage is already done.","\"The incentive is to extract every iota of value out of users\"","Data brokers create databases of information that’s pulled from Facebook and elsewhere. And once taken off the platform, data can be analyzed and re-imported later to be used to target people. Facebook allows advertisers to upload .CSV spreadsheets of information about people and use that information to specifically target people using its “Custom Audiences” product. That data can then be further used to target “Lookalike Audiences” on Facebook—people that data brokers might not know much about but who Facebook itself does know a lot about, according to Mislove.","Facebook’s partnerships with data brokers like Acxiom and Experian allow advertisers to leverage what Facebook knows about you with what data brokers know about you to create a more complex profile of who you are.","Together, Facebook and data brokers have made a list of things that it thinks I like, based on my likes, my apps, my web behavior, and, crutially, what data brokers already know about me.

In recent years, Facebook has allowed for greater, app-specific privacy setting control, but the fact remains that Facebook makes its money by selling advertisements, and those advertisements are more valuable to companies—and Facebook—because Facebook and the companies it works with can target you, specifically.","Though Facebook has made a few changes to make privacy control better, that basic calculus has not changed, and the old adage still applies: If you’re not paying for something, you are the product.","“The incentive is to extract every iota of value out of users,” Hartzog said. “The service is built around those incentives. You have to convince people to share as much information as possible so you click on as many ads as possible and then feel good about doing it. This is the operating ethos for the entire social internet.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

NPR's Michel Martin speaks with former Facebook product manager Antonio Garcia Martinez.","MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:","Now to another explosive story that has potential implications for both politics and the law. Members of Congress are calling for an investigation into the data firm Cambridge Analytica after new reports from the New York Times and The Observer of London. According to these reports, the personal information belonging to some 50 million people was stolen and used to target them in ways they would not have seen and could not have known about. This according to a former insider named Christopher Wylie.","He says this information was used to influence voters in the 2016 U.S. election. Cambridge Analytica has ties to the Trump campaign. In 2016, the firm was hired to run the campaign's data operations, and Steve Bannon is a former vice president of the firm. Facebook says the data was obtained legally but misused afterward, but they've suspended Cambridge Analytica from their platform.","We wanted to understand how all this could have happened and what it might mean, so we've called Antonio Garcia Martinez. He is a Silicon Valley veteran and early Facebook employee who headed the company's targeting efforts, and he is now a contributor at Wired.","Antonio Garcia Martinez, thank you so much for speaking to us.","ANTIONIO GARCIA MARTINEZ: Thank you for having me.","MARTIN: Well, as a person who has worked closely with big data, could you just tell us your reaction to these reports?","MARTINEZ: Yeah. It's not totally surprising. I mean, the thing to keep clear here is that the data that's, kind of, leaked out isn't really, kind of, from the ad system but rather what's called platform-internally. And what that means is there are apps on Facebook, and, you know, you opt into these as a user, and that's, kind of, how this data breach happened. And it's really this weird thing where there is data coming out of one side of Facebook being used on the other, which is on - which is on the outside. But, you know, frankly, I wasn't hugely surprised. I mean, this is one of those things that it's been part of the platform for years now, and there's really not much Facebook can actually do about it is the hard truth about it.","MARTIN: You know, I was going to ask you about this because this is being described as a data breach, which says that the information was stolen, and that is the word that the Observer report uses. It says that the - this information was stolen or that Facebook basically left the door open and allowed this to happen and didn't put enough controls into place to keep this from happening. Now, Facebook says that they are investigating but that people did consent to give out their information, so this was not a data breach. How do you respond to that?","MARTINEZ: Yeah, no. I mean, how that term is typically used, this is not a data breach. That really gives the impression that there was some sort of security flaw and that Facebook somehow got hacked and literally everything from, you know, your messages to your partner to your, you know, childhood photos were potentially stolen, but that's not the case at all. You know, most of your listeners, probably, at some point, have opted into a Facebook app, and you do that even when, for example, you're using Facebook to log into a website or even on a mobile app. When you consent to a certain app accessing your Facebook data, that's kind of what you're opting into.","So this wasn't that somebody broke into Facebook and stole data. This is users who opted into an app, and then the data that that app got via this opt-in was misused in ways that are not in accordance with Facebook's data policy. So I mean, to the extent that we can sort of distinguish between what a breach implies, which is kind of a break in Facebook security law, and, you know, data exiting in a way that user consented to that was then, kind of, misused, it's definitely the latter situation right here.","MARTIN: So let me take this from another direction. One way to look at this is that the information may have allowed the Trump campaign to microtarget specific groups of voters, so how is this different from what all campaigns do these days? Or businesses for that matter? I mean, one of the key sources for this reporting, Christopher Wylie, was studying fashion trend forecasting, and he just applied the same kind of logic to this other enterprise. So is this different from what users could reasonably assume was being done with their data?","MARTINEZ: You know, that's a great question. I mean, the short answer is no. I mean, this is kind of a - a somewhat obscure field of advertising targeting called psychographics, and that's, kind of, the buzz word for it. And what it basically means is it tries to capture a person's psychological state, you know, down to things like openness or neuroticism, and these are words that, you know, were quoted from some of the leaked emails that the Guardian leaked out, right? So they try to profile a person according to a certain psychological dimension, and then understand how likely that person was to vote for or against some issue or candidate. Right? And what they were trying to get at was using Facebook to understand how, you know, neurotic, say, you were. And if that neuroticism, in their minds, would incline you to vote for or against somebody, they would try to target you as a result of that.","This isn't new. I mean, this sort of psychographic type stuff has been around even before the internet. It's been around for decades. It's also been on Facebook before. In the past, there have been other outside companies that have tried to psychologically profile users. What's strange is that it was - you know, that the data used to actually build these psychological models was kind of unethically arrived at. That, to me, is a critical issue. You know, the - how powerful this data was - I mean, to be honest, I think most ads professionals don't buy much into this whole psychographic thing.","MARTIN: So could you just drill down on something you just said, which was you said there was something unethical or potentially unethical about the way this - this information was arrived at or it was taken by the firm that eventually used it. So what was unethical about that?","MARTINEZ: Well, if the allegations are to be believed what happened was that Cambridge Analytica or, you know, their confederates and consultants paid test subjects to take a political poll, and in the course of taking that political poll, they had to opt in to a Facebook app as we often do when we log into other sites using Facebook, the difference being is that in this case, they took the results of those political polls - right? - their inclinations, their psychological profiles - and they joined that with all their Facebook data that they managed to suck out of Facebook via this Facebook app that the users had opted in to, not just those Facebook users but also their friends.","On Facebook's platform - not anymore but until not too long ago - if you opted into an app, that gave access, potentially, to the app to your friends data as well. And that's why the number of users whose information has been compromised is as high as it is - 50 million people. Cambridge Analytica didn't pay 50 million people take a poll. It paid of order tens of thousands, but each of those individuals had hundreds or thousands of friends, which is why the number is so large. And that's what's unethical about it. They basically paid people to take a poll, but then they basically hoovered out all of their Facebook data and joined it with that political data. That's the illegal bit.","MARTIN: That's Antonio Garcia Martinez. He's the former head of Facebook's effort to develop ad-targeting strategies. He's now a contributor to Wired.","Antonio Garcia Martinez, thank you so much for speaking with us.","MARTINEZ: It was great time. Thanks.","MARTIN: We should also mention that we reached out to Facebook for comment. They said they are, quote, \"conducting an internal and external review,\" unquote, to make sure the data no longer exists.","NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by Verb8tm, Inc., an NPR contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with NPR.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

I guess that’s all they have left,” he said.","Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the “Wild West.”","“Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","With Republicans controlling the Senate’s majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail.","The New York Times and London’s Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted despite Facebook’s demands beginning in 2015.","Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015. The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said.","Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information.","Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action.","Cambridge Analytica in turn said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it.","Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. “We must do better and will,” he wrote on Twitter, adding that “our business depends on it at every level.”","Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied.","Nuala O’Connor, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said Facebook was relying on the good will of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse.","Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday. “That’s a long time,” she said.","Britain’s data protection authority and the Massachusetts attorney general on Saturday said they were launching investigations into the use of Facebook data.","“It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,” UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey’s office said she wants to understand how the data was used, what policies if any were violated and what the legal implications are."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Some publishers fear GroupM is pushing them to cover its own GDPR compliance needs, while leaving liability for fines firmly with the publisher.","The media-buying giant has said it sent the Data Protection Addendum to all its suppliers and vendors “that touch personal data in any way” in the European Union. The DPA is a contractually binding set of data protection principles that publishers would be expected to adhere to under the GDPR. The contract is nonnegotiable, according to the document.","Publishers’ legal teams are reviewing the document, but five publishers Digiday spoke to are feeling rattled by the terminology in the contract, with some calling it a “Trojan horse” document that could result in the publisher having to share the control of their data with Group M, promoting the agency group to be more like what the GDPR calls a data controller (from its current position as a data processor), which is the source of customer data. A data controller is regarded as a stronger position to be in, because they can communicate directly with the customer about consent needs, whereas a data processor doesn’t have that direct line of access as it uses data from a third-party source.","A GroupM spokesperson sent the following statement: “GroupM has an extensive GDPR program of which the GroupM data addendum forms only one part. The GroupM Data Addendum was prepared for all GroupM suppliers processing personal data whether that personal data belonged to GroupM, its clients or the supplier in question. The intention of the Data Addendum is to clearly signal the GroupM commitment to data privacy and to ask our suppliers to demonstrate the same commitment.”","The spokesperson added that the contract does not seek to impose any greater liability than already exists in the law and that the agency will handle publisher questions on a case-by-case basis.","Asked about publisher concerns about cutting ties with GroupM if they don’t sign, a GroupM spokesperson sent the following statement: “The future of our relationships with suppliers will depend on the nature of the supplier in question and the processing activities it carries out and how it demonstrates its commitment to data privacy and in particular GDPR.”","The issue of who is expected to gain consent from users and take liability for it is becoming clouded as GDPR enforcement looms. Publishers are known consumer brands and the source of the data. That means they’re in the best position to obtain consent from users with whom they have a direct relationship. For agencies and ad tech vendors further along the ad supply chain, it’s harder to gain consent. That has essentially put a target on publishers’ backs, with ad tech vendors and agencies trying to use them as vehicles to gain consent so they can continue ad targeting under the GDPR.","Amid a long list of terms and conditions in the DPA is a section on tags and data collection, which outlines how GroupM will be allowed to drop cookies and profile audiences, along with sharing publisher data while taking no liability risk itself. The terms and conditions state that publisher sites must accept rich media tags and other ad-serving tags and that the “agency and advertiser shall have no liability for the effect of tags on the sites.”","Industry sources said GroupM is essentially asking publishers to hand over their relationship with their audience — a big ask, given audience data is a publisher’s most precious asset.","Publishers’ legal teams are reviewing the document, but so far, the general consensus is they’re unlikely to sign the DPA. “Any publisher worth their salt won’t sign it,” said an industry executive. “It flouts the spirit of GDPR and undermines the business models of most publishers.”","GroupM’s contract comes at a time when Google is reportedly asking publishers to assume a “co-controller” position in GDPR compliance, wanting them to gain consent on its behalf for third-party websites and apps that use Google’s ad technology to sell ads, according to The Wall Street Journal.","The Internet Advertising Bureau Europe’s Transparency & Consent Framework, aimed at getting the whole industry compliant before GDPR enforcement starts, also requires publishers to agree to get consent on behalf of any ad tech partners they want to trade with, though it is optional for publishers to use it.","GroupM has opted to support the IAB Europe framework after scrapping its previous attempt to get publishers across the U.K. and EU countries to gain consent on its behalf — an initiative known as “Passport” — because publishers refused to cooperate.","“[GroupM explained] it as a very fair initiative for the market and that it’s in everyone’s best interest for them to get consent this way,” said a publishing executive of the Passport initative. “But they have also said that if you [publishers] don’t share consent, then they can’t use the technology to buy it [publisher inventory] that’s needed so they’ll have to stop trading. It’s like blackmail.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

SCL had illegitimately obtained data about Facebook users, and had apparently not destroyed that data when Facebook ordered it to in 2015. Consequently, the company was no longer allowed access to Facebook’s platform. “We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook,” Grewal concluded.","The next morning, it became clear just why SCL and Cambridge Analytica had been suspended so abruptly, and at such an odd hour: because the New York Times and the Observer were prepping major investigative stories about the company’s use of Facebook data, based on documents and other information from a 26-year-old whistle-blower named Christopher Wylie.","Both stories are excellent, and help us better understand exactly what Cambridge Analytica did during the 2016 election (and the primaries before it). But there are a few points worth pulling out and emphasizing.","Facebook was being used as it’s designed, and that’s the problem.","In 2014, while working at Cambridge Analytica, Wylie hired a University of Cambridge professor named Aleksandr Kogan to build a database of psychometric profiles. Cambridge Analytica — funded by the right-wing billionaire Mercer family and advised by then–Breitbart editor-in-chief Steve Bannon — hoped to use the data to target political advertising and influence voter behavior. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk freelance boards, Kogan hired around 270,000 people to fill out a survey in an app that they would install in their Facebook accounts.","Facebook apps, like FarmVille, extend the platform’s usability, but in installing them, users often give third-party developers like Kogan access to a significant amount of their own data. Worse, in 2014, when Kogan’s app was gathering data, Facebook’s terms of service allowed developers to request access to an app installer’s friends as well.","In other words, each of the 270,000 people who were paid to install the app also gave up a significant amount of data about their Facebook friends as well — meaning that from the original 270,000 subjects, Kogan managed to obtain as many as 50 million profiles, including information like locations, job and educational histories, and pages liked. Facebook has since changed privacy settings that mean you can’t be data-betrayed by your inconsiderate or careless friends. But at the time, there was nothing about what Kogan was doing with his app that broke any of Facebook’s rules. It wasn’t until he passed that data on to Cambridge Analytica that he put himself in violation of Facebook’s terms of use.","Facebook has therefore insisted that it was not party to a “breach” of user data. You could argue that this is a semantic argument, largely designed to protect the company from SEC regulations that would have required them to alert users that their data had been mishandled and distributed without explicit permission. Certainly, user trust has been breached, even if no particular server or database was illegally or maliciously accessed.","But I actually agree with Facebook on this point: It wasn’t breached; Kogan obtained profile data perfectly legitimately. I just don’t think that’s a good defense. As hardly needs stating at this point, Facebook’s business model is built on gathering data about its users. (“We … built models to exploit what we knew about [people] and target their inner demons,” Wylie tells the Observer. “That was the basis the entire company was built on.” He’s talking about Cambridge Analytica, but the statement is equally true of Facebook.) You can argue that it was a bad idea to allow a surveillance-advertising company to grow to the size and influence of Facebook. But everyone can agree that the data Facebook has gathered on its users should be better protected, and that users should have better knowledge of and control over that data. Kogan was able to access profiles of 50 million users by paying a mere 270,000 users to install an app — and able to pass that data on to a third party without Facebook’s knowledge — because Facebook made it remarkably easy to obtain information about its users, not because he did something particularly nefarious.","If this has happened once, it’s probably happened more than once.","Kogan ran afoul of the rules by passing the data he’d obtained to a third party — Cambridge Analytica. He’d presented the app to Facebook and to its users as a project gathering for academic research, but then had turned around and given it to a company that had not been named or identified, and which sought to use the data for political, not academic, purposes.","But it’s worth noting that the only reason any of us know that this happened is because of Cambridge Analytica’s prominence in the news. Facebook itself only seems to have become aware that Kogan’s data was being misused in late 2015, after a Guardian report outlined the company’s data-harvesting techniques. Having learned that millions of its users’ data was now in the hands of a company to whom no such permissions had been granted, Facebook demanded that Cambridge Analytica delete that data — and then never followed up.","The fact that all this data was obtained legitimately in the first place, and that the discovery that it had been mishandled was met with only token objection by Facebook, is not, to put it mildly, confidence-inspiring. If the Guardian had never reported on the Cruz campaign’s contract with Cambridge Analytica, would Facebook (or any of us) even know that profile data on so many users was out there? And given that, shouldn’t we be assuming that this same thing — shady mass data-harvesting of Facebook profiles, to be kept on third-party servers — has happened more than once?","Facebook has known about this for a long time, and has done nothing.","The Observer and Times stories are valuable for the level of detail they bring to Cambridge Analytica’s practices, and for the attention they draw to Facebook’s lax privacy protections. But much of the key information in both stories could also be found in an Intercept story from last year — and in the aforementioned Guardian story from December 2015.","It’s easy to be cynical about the sudden attention the story is now getting from the public, given that we’ve had two years to process Cambridge Analytica’s methods. And surely some of the attention is unwarranted — the result of sensationalized chatter about Cambridge Analytica’s overstated role in Trump’s victory. (More on that in a minute.) But Facebook has been silent over the course of those two years, too. To its credit, it’s changed app permissions so that developers can no longer access such a wide network of profiles. Yet even after it was aware that Cambridge Analytica was in possession of mishandled profile data, it did nothing beyond send a letter. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted,” Wylie told the Observer. It’s hard to square that with Facebook lawyer Grewal’s claim that “[p]rotecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do.”","The trouble is with Facebook, not (necessarily) Cambridge Analytica.","Trump’s victory in 2016 was so unexpected, and so close, that a whole cottage industry of explanations for his victory — from the prosaic to the conspiracy-driven — has emerged in its wake. Early coverage of Cambridge Analytica tended toward the sensational: Soon after the election, the Guardian called Cambridge Analytica’s influence “sinister,” and it was suggested in the woollier corners of Twitter that its “psychometric profiles” were not just a deciding factor in the election but a particularly dangerous one.","The truth is that there’s very little evidence that Cambridge Analytica’s particular methods have any different effect on voting behavior than any other digital political campaign efforts. Dave Karpf, a professor at Georgetown and expert in political advocacy on the internet, has called Cambridge Analytica the “Theranos of political data” — a company with “a tremendous marketing department, coupled with a team of research scientists who provide on virtually none of those marketing promises.”","Given the narrowness of Trump’s margins, could Cambridge Analytica have provided the extra nudge that pushed him across the finish line? Sure! And, yes, it’s awfully interesting that Cambridge Analytica employed a Russian-American professor who received funding from the Russian government. But until more reporting is done, that’s all it is — interesting. As Cambridge Analytica itself has resentfully pointed out, the Obama campaign was undertook similar Facebook data-gathering efforts. Those campaigns were aboveboard, and the uses of the data made clear to those who signed up — no small distinction — but they still used Facebook in much the same way. Focusing on Cambridge Analytica as a uniquely sinister actor in the election (or in the world of data acquisition or voter-targeting) ignores exactly how easy, and how mundane, their data-harvesting really was — and how vulnerable your Facebook data really is."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Simply log in to your account and click the padlock icon in the upper-right corner.","This gives you quick access to locking down who can see your posts and can contact you. That's great for covering the two big privacy problems, but there are plenty of other settings you need to know about.","That's why we're going to walk you through Facebook's privacy options and tell you which ones you definitely want to change. Even if you think you already have them set correctly, Facebook changes its settings and where they're located frequently so you should double-check.","To get started, log into your Facebook account. Then click the downward arrow in the upper-right corner and choose Settings.","General","You'll start on the General settings page. This is where you adjust your name, username, email, password, networks and temperature units.","Security","Move to the Security tab by clicking the Security link in the left column. The Security tab is where you set up login security, choose trusted contacts and browsers, manage your sessions and deactivate your account.","Make sure you turn on \"Login Alerts,\" which alerts you when someone logs in to your account from an unfamiliar gadget. Then turn on \"Login Approvals.\"","\"Login Approvals\" means you can only log in on a new computer or gadget if you have your phone with you to receive a special code. Even if a hacker gets your information, they'd need your phone as well to get into your account.","It's a little annoying at times, but the extra security is worth it. And you can set up trusted browsers and gadgets that don't require the extra security. You'll only see it if you try to log in from an unfamiliar gadget.","If you're worried about being locked out of your account, you can set up \"Trusted Contacts.\" These are friends who can help you get back in if you're locked out, either unintentionally or by a hacker.","Review \"Where You're Logged In\" to make sure you didn't leave a computer or gadget logged in somewhere that you didn't mean to, such as a library computer, or that someone isn't logged in without your knowledge.","This is also the area you can set up a \"Legacy Contact,\" which is someone who can take over your account in the event something happens to you.","Privacy","The Privacy tab controls who can see what you post and who can contact and find you.

The exception is if you want old friends from school to be able to send you friend requests.","Under \"Who can look me up?\" you want to change the settings to \"Friends,\" \"Friends\" and \"No.\" This makes it much harder for strangers or stalkers to find you if they just have a phone number, email address or know your name. Keep in mind, this will also stop old friends from easily finding you.","Timeline and Tagging","We've already limited who can see your posts, but the Timeline and Tagging tab has a few privacy loopholes you need to close.","In \"Who can add things to my timeline?\" you definitely want to limit who can post on your timeline to just \"Friends.\" If you really want to make sure you control everything people see on your timeline, you can change that to \"Only Me.\"","Also, be sure to set \"Review posts...\" to \"On.\" That way if a friend mentions you in a post you don't necessarily agree with or would make you look bad to your friends, you can stop it before it appears.","In \"Who can see things on my timeline?\" you can leave \"Who can see posts you've been tagged in...\" to \"Friends of Friends,\" since they'll be able to see the post on your friend's timeline anyway. If you want to be extra cautious, though, set it to \"Friends.\" You do, however, want \"Who can see what others post on your timeline?\" set to \"Friends.\"","Bonus Tip: In the \"Who can see things on my timeline?\" section, click the \"View As...\" link to see what your timeline looks like to strangers. This will quickly reveal if there's something showing that shouldn't be.","In \"How can I manage tags people add and tagging suggestions?\" you can set the settings to \"On,\" \"Only Me\" and \"No One.\" This keeps things you're tagged in, like photos, from automatically being visible to all your friends. It also keeps you from being tagged in photos you don't control, which can give away your face and name to people you don't know.","Blocking","Facebook is great for staying in touch with people, but some people you don't want in your life. That's where Facebook's Blocking feature comes in handy.","You can block individual users on Facebook and in Facebook Messenger; stop seeing app invitations and events from certain people; and block apps themselves or even block Facebook Pages.","If you want to see who you're already blocking, their names will show up under the Block users search box.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Apple locks down app permissions tightly, which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users. \"Apple's fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running, and keep customers in control of the information,\" said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security firm Securosis.","But Android has long been more indulgent.","Until recently, in fact, Google let app developers gain access to a phone's call and text logs. All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts. Once users agreed, Android would then also grant access to those communication histories.","Starting in 2012 with its \"Jelly Bean\" release, Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs, but still required them to agree to all those permissions at once. Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn't work.","It wasn't until 2015 when Google released Android 6.0, dubbed \"Marshmallow,\" that Android phones finally split up those permissions. That meant users could agree to share contacts, but reject access to their messaging and phone histories.","That's the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information. But many Android users aren't using the latest version of the software. In fact, they often can't get it even if they want it.","Apple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones, which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will. Google, by contrast, is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions.","There are nearly 20,000 different Android phone models now in service, and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks. As a result, new Android versions reach users very slowly.","As of January, about 65 per cent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software, introduced in 2017. Less than 1 per cent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android, known as \"Oreo.\" (Many of them are owners of Google's new Pixel phones, which get software updates directly from Google.)","Just over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions, which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs. Last October, Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates, even on phones running older versions of Android.","All that leaves two big questions unanswered. Why did Google set up Android permissions this way? And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup?","Experts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google's advertising-based business model, which — like Facebook — depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads. Apple, meanwhile, derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music.","Another possible factor: Android was playing catch-up with Apple for many years, and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple's App Store. Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive — as Facebook did.","Experts say it's not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts, but it's very possible.","\"In a lot of ways, Facebook is the tip of the iceberg,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. \"There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection.\"","A Google spokesperson was unable to say how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users' call logs had been sent to app developers. The company declined to comment further.","The role of manufacturers of Android phones for protecting user privacy remains unclear, South Korean mobile device maker LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday in a statement.","\"Privacy is everyone's responsibility — software providers, carriers, as well as device manufacturers,\" said LG, whose smartphones run on the Android operating system.","\"At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution,\" it said. \"If hardware played a role in the breach then we will certainly look into solution options.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The agency, which is tasked with protecting consumers from abusive business practices, has announced that it has opened an investigation of Facebook's handling of user privacy.","According to the FTC, there is an ongoing non-public investigation of the social network. As such, details of the investigation are scarce. However, the FTC notes the issue is related to recent media reports of Facebook's lax privacy practices. It allowed consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to collect data on some 50 million users, and recent reports indicate it sneakily vacuumed up more data than it should have via Android permissions. Although, the latter issue seems to have been blown out of proportion.","Facebook's stock price has slipped another 3% on the news, leaving the company's stock down around 16% in the last few weeks. If the FTC finds Facebook failed to adequately protect its users, it could be fined as much as $40,000 per violation. That could, theoretically, mean a $2 trillion fine. That's obviously not going to happen, but the FTC could still hit Facebook with a big bill to pay.","I just post memes and inspiring quotes on my Facebook account. But I know some of my friends post some party pics that can be taken the wrong way.","Just be careful what you post I guess.","NexusKoolaid","Be careful what you post?

Specifically, people such as bloated bureaucrats, clerks and flunkies who cannot be fired, are bitter, vengeful and typically lower on the intelligence scale. Good to know my tax dollars are being spent on such a worthwhile endevaor.","RadarJammer","You \"are bitter, vengeful and typically lower on the intelligence scale\", Trumpkin.","BC","Facebook does deserve to be fined and suffer a major backlash against their service due to their lax security practices as if one is going to collect such data, protect the hell out of it.

Simon Dawson/Bloomberg","Billionaire philanthropist and leading donor to liberal causes George Soros predicted Thursday that regulation and taxation will soon dethrone Facebook and Google, describing the tech industry's major players as powerful monopolies that harm individuals, market innovation and democracy.","In a wide-ranging, scathing speech delivered at a dinner event at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Soros applauded the European Union's heightened enforcement aimed at Web giants. He also called for greater regulation of the tech companies, seizing on a growing backlash against Silicon Valley.","“Facebook and Google have grown into ever more powerful monopolies, they have become obstacles to innovation, and they have caused a variety of problems of which we are only now beginning to become aware,” he said, according to a transcript of the speech.","Google and Facebook declined to comment.","Soros made the remarks as officials in Washington and industry critics continued to ramp up their scrutiny of the tech sector. That pressure has been directed at a broad array of issues, perhaps most prominently online advertising and the spread of disinformation on popular social media platforms. In response, Facebook and Google have said they are open to greater government oversight in their ad operations. But Facebook has gone even further in recent weeks, publicly grappling with its role in global society. Last week Facebook even admitted in a blog post that social media can sometimes harm democracy.","Soros suggested that American officials draw from their European counterparts, particularly E.U. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, whom he described as the “nemesis” of American tech monopolies. Vestager, a former Danish economy minister, and other E.U. officials have recently advanced a host of enforcement actions against prominent U.S. tech companies. E.U. officials have sued Google over alleged antitrust violations tied to its search engine, its mobile operating system and its ad platform. In 2016, competition authorities ordered Apple to pay Ireland more than $15 billion in uncollected taxes; and Facebook has been penalized by several privacy watchdogs for breaking data protection rules.","Soros acknowledged that Europe's approach to antitrust law and regulation differs from that of the United States. But his criticism of Facebook and Google may empower Democrats who have already expressed skepticism toward Silicon Valley and the broader world of tech and telecom.","In October, for instance, congressional Democrats, with notable support from Republican Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), introduced legislation that would place greater disclosure requirements on Web platforms that run political advertisements. The lawmakers behind the bill say the rules will help prevent Russia and other foreign powers from exploiting social media and undermining U.S. elections. And last summer, the Democratic Party released a broad economic agenda, dubbed a “Better Deal,\" that included stricter enforcement of antitrust laws and a push against corporate monopolies.","While Soros is often criticized by conservative figures who oppose his political projects, his attack on the tech giants highlights a brewing convergence between leaders on the left and the right who have come to view Silicon Valley as a perverse influence on the country.","“It is only a matter of time before the global dominance of the U.S. IT monopolies is broken,” Soros said. “Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered.”","Hamza ShabanHamza Shaban is a technology reporter for The Washington Post.

{"originalurl":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/cambridge-analytica-chris-wylie-eunoia-trump-campaign?s=mobile_app","title":"The Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower Wanted His New Company To Work With Trump Campaign’s Manager","text":["Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica cofounder who recently blew the whistle on the political consulting firm’s improper procurement of the personal data of millions of Facebook users, had the same data set when he was establishing a business of his own in 2014, according to information obtained by BuzzFeed News. The following year, that company, Eunoia Technologies, subsequently pitched Republican political operative Corey Lewandowski on microtargeting tools that could be deployed on behalf of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","Emails from 2014 provided to BuzzFeed News show that Eunoia possessed a database of more than 50 million Facebook profiles at the time. That same information — and Facebook’s wider data collection policies in general — are now being scrutinized following reports by the New York Times and the Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired it from a company called Global Science Research (GSR), which originally collected it for academic purposes.","GSR, Cambridge Analytica, and Wylie said they have since deleted the data. Cambridge Analytica, which Donald Trump’s presidential campaign employed throughout 2016 to build ad-targeting profiles on potential voters, claimed in a statement Friday that none of the Facebook information in question was used for the election. And while there is no current indication Eunoia used the database or pitched it to Lewandowski, the fact that Wylie's little-known startup — which was a wholly distinct entity from Cambridge Analytica — possessed it at all is the latest in a string of revelations in Facebook's data crisis and further evidence that the company is unable to track how the personal profile information it collects is employed and distributed by third parties.","Other documents from Eunoia, which marketed ad microtargeting services to corporate and political clients, reveal that in the spring of 2015 Wylie’s startup pitched elections-related work to Trump’s eventual campaign manager, Lewandowski. One source, who declined to be named for fear of endangering personal and business relationships confirmed the authenticity of these documents; another person, who had direct knowledge of Eunoia’s meeting with Lewandowski, confirmed the Wylie-led startup’s interest in working for the fledgling Trump campaign.","Since blowing the whistle on Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, Wylie has said very little about Eunoia and his aspirations for it. He also has not spoken at all about his startup’s meeting with Lewandowski, who would go on to lead the Trump campaign. In response to BuzzFeed News’ questions about Eunoia last week, Wylie’s lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that her client “has not worked for Republican clients since leaving [Cambridge Analytica]” and that his company had “no data or assets.”","“Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets.”","The documents obtained by BuzzFeed and subsequent interviews with sources do not always cast Wylie in a flattering light, but they also do not call into question his claims about the improper transfer of Facebook user data to political consulting entities. After responding to an initial request for comment, Wylie's attorney went dark and did not answer the questions BuzzFeed News put to her Tuesday.","In a four-hour hearing of the UK Commons select committee on digital culture, media, and sport on Tuesday, Wylie was asked by committee chair Damian Collins if he had benefited from the GSR data set on other projects that he’d worked on outside of Cambridge Analytica.","“I didn’t do any contracts or do any, you know, work with that data,” Wylie replied. “I haven’t worked with any clients … That data got deleted, I believe, in 2015 on my end.”","“SCL Without Alexander Nix”","Last week, BuzzFeed News reported that Wylie discussed plans to “build the NSA’s wet dream” in late 2013 while still working at Cambridge Analytica. “Our goal is first to make it an extremely profitable company,” he wrote in late 2013. “Then we will cleanse our souls with other projects, like using the data for good rather than evil. But evil pays more.\"","According to two people who knew Wylie at this time, the SCL microtargeting specialist had approached a number of colleagues about leaving their jobs to join him in a new company. According to one person, Wylie hoped to model his firm after Palantir Technologies, the CIA-backed, Silicon Valley data-mining company.","“He was very much trying to build this company and his vision was, ‘I want to build SCL without [Cambridge Analytica CEO] Alexander Nix,’” said one person who talked to Wylie about his new venture. Last week, Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix pending an investigation after he was recorded by the UK’s Channel 4 touting his firm’s ability to influence foreign elections and discussing techniques to entrap and blackmail political candidates. Cambridge Analytica did not return a request for comment.","By the beginning of 2014, Wylie had put together a presentation for a company called Arg.us. According to its pitch deck, which was seen and published in part by BuzzFeed News, the company said it could ingest users' social media activity to build “psychographic” profiles for marketers who could then target ads to specific users and possibly influence behavior. By the winter of that year, Wylie was having conversations about his idea with Silicon Valley venture capitalists, including one who spoke to BuzzFeed News and received a note that said the products that Wylie had promised had been used for previous political clients.","Wylie’s lawyer previously said that Arg.us presentation was “never a serious pitch,” and it’s not clear how it was used. That said, similarities in documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News suggest it was a precursor to Eunoia.","After leaving Cambridge Analytica and SCL in late June of 2014, Wylie pivoted his focus to Eunoia — Greek for “beautiful thinking” — formulating a company that could perform so-called psychographic modeling and targeting for its clients. By August, he was working at Eunoia with Tobias Kloepper, a one-time SCL data scientist who would obtain Facebook data for the young startup. Emails viewed by BuzzFeed News indicate that Aleksandr Kogan, a data scientist and founder of GSR, shared a database of more than 50 million Facebook users with Kloepper.","Kogan and Kloepper did not respond to requests for comment. It’s unclear if Wylie ever used that data, with the whistleblower noting in front of a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that he eventually deleted it because “I wasn’t going to do anything with it.”","Correspondence between Wylie and an acquaintance from September 2014 show that, while Wylie was particularly interested in courting fashion industry clients, he claimed to also have meetings with Monsanto, the American Petroleum Institute, and Ford. A Eunoia fashion-focused presentation from the time obtained by BuzzFeed News said the company had a “database that contains the information of hundreds of millions of individual consumers with emails, Facebook/Twitter IDs and mailing addresses,” while a separate company brochure specifically discusses targeting voters for potential political clients. Neither document mentions the specific GSR data set of 50 million Facebook users, and it’s unclear if Eunoia ever put that data to use.","“The heart of our work stems from a rigorous scientific understanding of human behavior, which in turn allows us to engineer more responsive audiences and engage consumers more precisely,” read the brochure. “To do this, we have developed a series of algorithms that can predict the personality traits of individual voters by analyzing their voterfile [sic], social, online and consumer data.”","Neither the presentation nor the brochure mention the provenance of that \"social, online and consumer data.\"","Provided to BuzzFeed News","A presentation slide for fashion clients from Eunoia Technologies.","According to one person, GSR gave its data to Eunoia after Kogan had negotiated an agreement where the startup would receive the information without charge as part of a data-sharing agreement between the two parties. Wylie never provided Kogan with data of his own, this person said, and GSR moved to cancel its agreements with Eunoia in early 2015. Eunoia appears to never have officially launched; a separate source told BuzzFeed News that it was unable to secure funding.","Data On The Loose","The contested data set, which GSR harvested using a 2014 Facebook personality quiz where users permitted the app to obtain personal information about themselves and their friends, has kick-started investigations from governments around the world. In the US, multiple members of Congress have asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify on Capitol Hill about the social network’s data policies and how the information of more than 50 million users could have ended up in the hands of a company doing elections consulting work.","As BuzzFeed News has learned, the spread of the Facebook data was not confined to Cambridge Analytica. Wylie may have had access to the data set for more than a year after founding Eunoia, with Facebook only acting to address the violation of its rules in late 2015, after the release of a story in the Guardian. GSR was told to delete its data in December 2015, according to a source, while Wylie said in testimony in front a parliamentary committee Tuesday that he believed he deleted the GSR data “some time in 2015” after being contacted by Kogan.","Earlier this month, after learning that several outlets were working on stories about the Trump campaign–hired data analysis company, the social networking giant moved to suspend the Facebook accounts of Cambridge Analytica, SCL, and Wylie. Facebook declined to comment for this story.","\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post last Wednesday. He added that the company would investigate “all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014.” The company took out full-page ads in several newspapers last Sunday apologizing for the mistake.","Asked last week if Eunoia had used any data sets on Facebook users, Wylie’s lawyer, Allen, was adamant. “Eunoia was a personal service company that has no data or assets,” she wrote.","Provided to BuzzFeed News","Eunoia business cards","Eunoia And Trump’s Campaign Manager","In an interview with NBC’s Today show last week, Wylie drew a line between Cambridge Analytica and Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “What I do know is that Cambridge Analytica was meeting with Corey Lewandowski in 2015 before Trump had even announced and offering the services that I’m talking about right now,” he said.","What Wylie didn’t say is that Eunoia Technologies also met with Lewandowski around the same time. According to one source, Lewandowski met with representatives of the company, including Tadas Jucikas, a former SCL employee, and Mark Gettleson, Eunoia’s communications and marketing strategist, around Easter Sunday 2015 in the lobby of a New York Central Park hotel. Wylie did not attend the meeting, said the person, but he was well aware of it and its purpose to discuss voter microtargeting for a possible presidential candidate.","Drew Angerer / Getty Images","Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski arrives at Trump Tower in December 2016 in New York City.","While Trump’s campaign went on to work with Cambridge Analytica later in 2016, the person said that Lewandowski met with Eunoia, in part, because the Alexander Nix operation was already working for Ted Cruz’s presidential election team at the time. According to that source, that meeting included “high-level discussions” about microtargeting techniques and did not include any talk about Facebook data.","Jucikas declined to comment. Gettleson did not respond to multiple requests for comment, including phone calls, emails, and a visit to his London home. Lewandowski, who became Trump’s official campaign manager when the billionaire announced his candidacy in June 2015, did not respond to a request for comment.","Emails obtained by BuzzFeed News further corroborate the pitch to the Trump campaign. In April 2015, following the meeting with Lewandowski, Gettleson, a political operative with UK’s liberal democratic party, sent an email with the subject line “Trump” to a graphic designer who had been designing business cards and brochures for the company. The email included an attachment labeled “Trump-Handout,” which contained a list of various political microtargeting products and services offered by the company. The graphic designer made a few adjustments to the document and placed its contents on official Eunoia stationery before sending it back to Gettleson in a PDF called “eunioa_stationary_introletter.” It’s unclear if these documents were then sent to Lewandowski or if Eunoia had any further meetings with Trump’s eventual campaign manager.","A cache of documents sent to BuzzFeed News by a source, which included business contracts and pitch decks, reveal other individuals who, to varying degrees, were associated with the fledgling startup. Many of those people did not want to talk about their involvement with the company or did not return BuzzFeed News’ requests for comment. Ray Larson, a former strategist for Canada’s liberal party, did not respond to emails and a phone message; Brent Clickard, a former colleague of Wylie’s at SCL declined to comment. A source close to Clickard said that while he spoke with Wylie about working at Eunoia, the pair never formalized an agreement.","Alfredas Chmieliauskas, a London-based employee of Palantir, said he had “no idea” why his name was on Eunoia’s business documents, adding that while Wylie knew “a former school friend of mine ... we never had a working relationship of any sort.” On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that Chmieliauskas, while at Palantir, began corresponding with Wylie in 2013 and later gave him the idea to develop the quiz app, eventually employed by Kogan, to harvest Facebook user data. Wylie also visited with Palantir, with a company spokesperson later confirming that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica considered working together at one point.","Correspondence from Wylie that was given to BuzzFeed News show Wylie bragging to an acquaintance in late 2013 about the prospect of someone from Palantir wanting to join his idea for a startup.","It is not clear if these people, who denied having official work relationships with Eunoia or did not reply altogether, knew that the company had access to a data set with more than 50 million Facebook users or that its associates were meeting with potential presidential campaigns.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record.\"","According to a source, Eunoia also sought to hire Mark Block, the former chief of staff to 2012 presidential candidate Herman Cain who had a brief spell of notoriety for smoking a cigarette in a campaign ad. Block’s name and that of his associate, Linda Hansen, were printed on a proof sheet of draft Eunoia business cards given to BuzzFeed News by a second source.","“You guys are a bunch of assholes, and you can put that on the record,” Block said when asked about his relationship with Eunoia and Wylie. Block, who reportedly introduced Steve Bannon to SCL and worked for the company’s elections division as its head of US sales, according to an archived version of SCL’s website, declined to say anything more.","\"There were discussions about politics and some other ex [Cambridge Analytica] staff wanted to continue working in Republican politics,\" Wylie's lawyer said in an email to earlier questions last week. \"However they parted ways with Mr Wylie to set up their own company that does work for Republican clients. ... Mr Wylie has not worked for Republicans since leaving CA and does not wish to in the future.\""],"isopubdate":""}

It is naïve to suggest that we can ever again be truly private individuals, however much we might like to be, but is the harvesting of our personal information getting out of hand? The moral issue is not just about privacy - whether these companies should have such information about us in the first place - but is also about the ways in which it can be used. Is it right to divide up the population into sub-groups, without their knowledge, so they can be precisely targeted with advertisements and political propaganda? \"Shocking!\" say some newspaper pundits. \"It's what advertisers and campaigners have always done,\" say others. What, if anything, should be done about it? Harsher punishments? Stricter regulation? Is it the moral duty of companies to be more transparent, beyond the small-print 'Terms and Conditions' that hardly anyone reads or understands? Cheerleaders for Big Data point to its potential to transform our lives, improving health and education. Its detractors say the abuse of personal information is nothing less than a threat to democracy. And there are some who believe both positions are overstated and who worry that we have lost faith in the public's ability to make its own judgments.

People using WhatsApp were given 30 days to opt out of the data exchange policy and were notified of the changes on the first updated use of the app.","The WP29 wrote to WhatsApp in October last year highlighting that it had serious concerns [PDF] about the manner in which user data is being shared across the Facebook-owned services. The UK information commissioner Elizabeth Denham then in November penned a blog post advising WhatsApp to better explain its privacy policy changes to consumers so they have an \"unambiguous choice\" before Facebook uses their data \"for advertisement and product improvement purposes\".","\"It's important that we have control over our personal information, even if services don't charge us a fee,\" Denham wrote at the time.","WhatsApp added a \"notice for EU users\" in August 2017, but the WP29 believes it does not \"sufficiently address the issues of non-compliance with data protection law\".","In its letter, the pan-European data regulator expresses the ways in which WhatsApp's privacy policy does not comply with EU rules around consent, which needs to be \"unambiguous, specific, informed, and freely given\" to be considered valid.","Under EU regulations, consent must \"consist of a statement or clear affirmative action, be demonstrable, clearly distinguishable, intelligible and easily accessible, use clear language and be capable of being withdrawn\", which WP29 claims is absent in the language WhatsApp uses in its notice of change.","\"WhatsApp is updating our Terms and Privacy Policy to reflect new features like WhatsApp calling. Read our Terms and Privacy Policy and learn more about the choices you have. Please agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy to continue using WhatsApp. If you don't wish to agree, you'll need to discontinue using WhatsApp,\" the WhatsApp notice of change states, according to the WP29.","The data regulator said the company has taken a \"take it or leave it\" approach in which users either signal their \"consent\" to the sharing of data or they are unable to use the service.","When users slide up to read more about the updates to WhatsApp's terms of use and privacy policy, a pre-ticked check-box appears saying that the user consents to share their \"WhatsApp account information with Facebook\" to improve their Facebook ads and product experiences. The WP29 said this is not \"unambiguous\" as it's unclear what constitutes \"WhatsApp account information\" and for what specific purpose they will be shared with Facebook's other products.","Expecting that the companies will argue that they need data to pursue their legitimate business interests, the WP29 said that the legitimate interests ground can not be invoked when such interests are \"overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.\" As such, those business interests need to be clearly specified in its privacy policy.","WhatsApp also failed to offer \"sufficiently granular user controls\" to let users opt out of data sharing activities, according to the WP29.","Both Facebook and WhatsApp have been invited to meet with the taskforce to clearly set out how these issues can be addressed.","In May, the European Commission fined the social media giant €110 million for providing \"misleading information\" regarding its takeover of WhatsApp in 2014.","The fine is in accordance with the commission's merger regulation, which requires companies in a merger investigation to provide the correct information for the commission to review mergers -- something that Facebook failed to do, according to the commission.","In May 2018, a new data-privacy policy will take effect across Europe called the General Data Protection Regulation. The updated rules, which will replace the ones established in 1995, aim to unify data privacy across Europe to simplify regulations for international businesses doing business in Europe.","The GDPR will require organisations around the world that hold data belonging to individuals from within the EU to provide a high level of protection and explicitly know where every piece of data is stored. Organisations that fail to comply with the regulation requirements could be fined up to €20 million, or, in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 percent of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year -- whichever is higher.","Thank You","By registering you become a member of the CBS Interactive family of sites and you have read and agree to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Video Services Policy.

The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","\"For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,\" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. \"I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.\"","The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized \"the right to be forgotten,\" allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","\"The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,\" said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking \"I Agree.\" The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to \"bracket off\" European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.","\"Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,\" she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. \"We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,\" it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","\"Cambridge Analytica's story sounds like a spy novel,\" he said. \"It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,\" he said. \"We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Kogan, who is a researcher in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, created the app that acquired the personal information of 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded the app in 2013. Billed as a research app used by psychologists, the \"thisisyourdigitallife\" app collected information such as hometown, content the users liked and their friends.","In addition to the information about the 270,000 who downloaded the app, the app also collected information about users' friends. According to The New York Times report, 30 million of the 50 million profiles collected had enough information to match users to other records and build profiles of them.","Facebook learned in 2015 that Kogan had passed along the information -- against agreed-upon privacy policies -- to Cambridge Analytica and to Eunoia Technologies' Christopher Wylie. Wylie has so far declined to submit to an audit.","\"This is data Cambridge Analytica, (Cambridge parent company) SCL, Mr. Wylie, and Mr. Kogan certified to Facebook had been destroyed,\" the company's statement continued. \"If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made.\"","The app in question, \"would not be permitted access to detailed friends' data today,\" according to Facebook's review procedures, the company said. \"We also want to be clear that today when developers create apps that ask for certain information from people, we conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data. We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.\"","Cambridge Analytica, which touted its role in helping swing the 2016 election to Pres. Trump, was asked in December to turn over documents to special counsel Robert Mueller, as part of his investigation into collusion between the campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Criticism of Facebook by lawmakers began over the weekend when The New York Times chronicled findings about the data mishandling calling it a \"breach\" that \"underpinned\" the analytics firm's \"work on President Trump's campaign in 2016.\" The Observer of London also reported on the situation Saturday.","Senators Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called for Senate hearings into the situation and for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate, noting that a 2011 consent decree between the agency and Facebook puts stringent privacy restrictions on Facebook's handling of user data.","\"The Committee should move quickly to hold a hearing on this incident, which has allegedly violated the privacy of tens of millions of Americans,” said Markey, a member of the Commerce committee, in a letter sent to the committee's leadership.","The FTC should investigate, Blumenthal said on Twitter, calling Facebook's agreement to hold to the consent decree \"a hollow promise.\" The social networking giant's failure \"to secure privacy of private data - that it released - seems a breach of trust and even law,\" he said on Twitter. \"Judiciary Committee should hold open hearings, with Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and others, under oath and in public.\"","FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info - now a hollow promise.","European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said on Twitter that the allegations represent \"an unacceptable violation of our citizens’ privacy rights.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2gnZOtu?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.f0d3b61f438b","title":"‘60 Minutes’ profiles the genius who won Trump's campaign: Facebook - The Washington Post","text":["If you do a search for Brad Parscale’s appearance on “60 Minutes,” the first thing that pops up above the results as of Monday morning is an ad for Brad Parscale.","And that, in a nutshell, is Brad Parscale.","Fleshed out, Parscale is the man behind the Trump campaign’s digital media efforts in 2016. He was hired to create a website for $1,500 (as he explained in that “60 Minutes” interview) and then his role expanded until he was managing tens of millions of dollars intended to promote the presidential candidate online.","The point of the interview was, in part, to serve as a profile of Parscale but, more broadly, to explain the primary way in which those millions were spent. Per Parscale’s accounting, that was largely on Facebook advertising. Trump’s team advertised on other platforms, too, but “Facebook was the 500-pound gorilla, 80 percent of the budget kind of thing,” Parscale said.","He also revealed that Facebook even sent staff — whose political persuasion had been cleared by the company — to aid in that effort, to help Parscale “know every, single secret button, click, technology [they] have,” as he said in the interview. The campaign poured money into Facebook, sending thousands of versions of tweaked ads to maximize response. Then it won the presidency by a margin narrow enough that Parscale (and Facebook) can justifiably take credit.","Parscale — and every political consultant in a similar situation — is doing this interview to build his business. The introduction of sophisticated digital tools to the process of electing candidates has resulted in a bumper crop of people claiming that they have mastered this inscrutable system and that you should hire them.","Right after the campaign, it was the firm Cambridge Analytica that was making this case, arguing that its black-box analysis of the psychology of American voters allowed Trump to target specific sorts of people with ads that dug deep into their brains to trigger a response. The company (owned in part by the family of Robert Mercer, which was in other ways essential to Trump’s success) wanted to convince future candidates that they could work their magic to get them elected, too.","To “60 Minutes,” Parscale dismissed that claim — in part because he was in the midst of claiming that he was the one with the magic touch. He didn’t think Cambridge Analytica’s system of creating “psychographic” profiles of people was sinister, he said — he just didn’t think it worked.","Which is a simply bizarre claim in the broader context. It isn’t that Parscale doesn’t think that building profiles of people to target ads to them doesn’t work. It’s that Parscale doesn’t seem to realize that this is basically what Facebook was doing for him, in real-time.","By its very nature, Facebook does a more complete and more robust version of what Cambridge Analytica claims to accomplish. In 2014, we explained how Facebook’s political tools work, how it combines data about what you’ve clicked with outside consumer data to get as complete a picture of who you are and what you like as anything that exists. But then it overlays the ability to advertise specific things to specific people — and to test and refine and improve on those ads.","This is what Parscale was describing to “60 Minutes” — not his genius, but Facebook’s. He shows the nifty tricks that you can do with Facebook, A/B testing (as the process is known) different versions of ads with different photos and ads that allow the most effective to quickly rise to the surface. He clearly used all of those secret buttons, clicks and technology that he sought, leveraging Facebook’s deep sense of its individual users and tools to target them. Stepping back, Parscale comes off like the guy who hires LeBron James to play on his team in a 3-on-3 basketball tournament and then brags about his capable coaching. He’s an ad buyer, who lets the platform — say, on Google, when you search for his name — do the work.","From Facebook’s perspective, dedicating staff to a client who was spending north of $70 million with your company (80 percent of the $94 million Parscale says the campaign paid his company to buy ads) makes perfect sense. But it does complicate Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg’s statement last month about how Facebook is being deliberate about protecting the “integrity of elections,” as it did in Germany’s recent balloting. Facebook doesn’t want outside actors (read: Russians) buying secret ads to influence the election but will provide you staff resources to help you spend millions to influence it yourself.","Again, we can’t know how much influence Facebook had. We know that the social-networking site has, in the past, proven that it can increase turnout for a campaign, but we don’t know how much it boosted turnout for Trump in 2016, or where.","Nor do we know how much Facebook advertising reduced turnout. Shortly before the election, Bloomberg reported on the Trump campaign’s tripartite voter suppression effort, targeting black voters, young women and white liberals with ads to discourage them from being enthusiastic about Hillary Clinton’s candidacy.","In the least believable part of Parscale’s interview, he denies that this happened.","“Did you microtarget by race?” CBS’s Lesley Stahl asks.","“No, we did not,” Parscale replies. “Not at all.”","If he never targeted anyone by race at all, his would be the first campaign in probably a century not to. Of course they targeted to some extent by race; every campaign does. Setting aside the context of voter suppression, there are issues that resonate better with, say, Hispanic voters than white ones, and so you talk about those issues with Hispanic voters. To go back to the basketball tournament analogy, what Parscale is saying is the equivalent of his having asked LeBron James not to take any jump shots. Sure you did.","Part of the problem with Facebook’s entry into politics, as the whole Russian-intervention situation has shown, is that some ads are bought quietly and shown only to small groups of people. Parscale claims that the campaign ran those so-called “dark ads” (so-called because they exist mostly in the shadows) but that none had negative or controversial messages. Had they done so, he said, “they would share a million times, it would be all over.”","Assuming, that is, that people knew they were from the Trump campaign.","The takeaway from the “60 Minutes” interview is simple. Facebook is a juggernaut that’s probably more influential in politics than it realizes itself. (See this New York magazine article to that end.)","Parscale says that his wife likes to say that “[he] was thrown into the Super Bowl, never played a game and won.” Right. It’s just that, in that example, he’s neither Tom Brady nor Bill Belichick. At best, he’s the guy who decided to hire them."],"isopubdate":"2018-02-14"}

The president would love to clip CEO Jeff Bezos’ wings. But he doesn’t have a plan to make that happen.","Behind the president's thinking: Trump's wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him — and he agrees — that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.","Trump tells people Amazon has gotten a free ride from taxpayers and cushy treatment from the U.S. Postal Service.","“The whole post office thing, that's very much a perception he has,” another source said. “It's been explained to him in multiple meetings that his perception is inaccurate and that the post office actually makes a ton of money from Amazon.\"","Axios' Ina Fried notes: The post office actually added delivery on Sunday in some cities because Amazon made it worthwhile.","Trump also pays close attention to the Amazon founder's ownership of The Washington Post, which the president views as Bezos’ political weapon.","Trump never talks about Mark Zuckerberg or Facebook: He isn’t tuned in to the debate over how they handle people’s data, and thinks the Russia story is a hoax, sources say.","Axios' Kim Hart points out: Trump has said he doesn’t mind Facebook because it helps him reach his audience. He's an old-school businessman who sees the world in terms of tangible assets: real estate, physical mail delivery, Main Street, grocery stores. It reminds me of the story Jim wrote about Trump’s fixation with 1950s life. Amazon takes direct aim at some of the core components of mid-century business.","One warning sign for Facebook: Vice President Mike Pence is concerned about Facebook and Google, according to a source with direct knowledge.","Though Pence isn't yet pushing internally for any specific regulations, he argues these companies are dangerously powerful.","The source said the V.P. worries about their influence on media coverage, as well as their control of the advertising industry and users’ personal info.","When private discussions have turned to the idea of busting Facebook and Google, Pence has listened with keen interest and is open to the suggestion that these two companies need shaking up.","2. Trump’s land of make-believe","President Trump often gets agitated — and stirred to action — by random things he hears on TV or from shoot-the-bull conversations with friends.","It drives staff nuts because they are responding to things that are either inaccurate, highly distorted or flat-out don't exist.","Exhibit 1: The post office example from item above","Exhibit 2: \"Per two senior administration officials, Trump continued to rail privately about the omnibus bill, and has become convinced of things that aren’t true about it,\" the N.Y.

These new stories, backed by Wylie’s account and internal documents, followed years of reporting by The Guardianand The Intercept about the possible problem.","The details could seem Byzantine. Aleksandr Kogan, then a Cambridge academic, founded a company, Global Science Research, and immediately took on a major client, Strategic Communication Laboratories, which eventually gave birth to Cambridge Analytica. (Steve Bannon, an adviser to the company and a former senior adviser to Trump, reportedly picked the name.)","The promise of Kogan’s company was that they could build psychological profiles of vast numbers of people by using Facebook data. Those profiles, in turn, might be useful to tune the political messages that Cambridge Analytica sent to potential voters. Perhaps a certain kind of message might appeal more to extroverts, or narcissists, or agreeable people.","To gather that data, the Times reports, Kogan hired workers through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to install a Facebook app in their accounts. The app, built by Global Science Research, requested an unusual (but not unheard-of) amount of data about users themselves and their friends. That’s how 270,000 Turkers ended up yielding 30 million profiles of American Facebook users that could be matched with other data sets.","From the current reporting, it seems that Kogan violated Facebook’s terms of service in saying he was using the data for academic research, but then selling it to Strategic Communications Laboratories. That’s what got Cambridge Analytica and Kogan in trouble. (Cambridge Analytica told The Guardian that they do not have possession of the data nor did they use any of this data in the 2016 election. An anonymous source in the Times story disputes this.)","There’s a lot about Cambridge Analytica that doesn’t quite add up. Are they data geniuses who swung the Brexit vote and got Trump elected, or pretenders bluffing their way to fat marketing contracts? Right after the election, several stories pointed to their psychological profiles of voters as a crucial piece of the Trump digital machine. As time has gone on, their role has come to be seen as less important, more in line with the tiny slice of the Trump campaign treasury that they got, roughly $6 million.","While the specifics of this particular violation are important to understand, the story reveals deeper truths about the online world that operates through and within Facebook.","First, some of Facebook’s growth has been driven by apps, which the company found extended the amount of time that people spent on the platform, as retired users of FarmVille could attest. To draw developers, Facebook had quite lax (or, as one might say, “developer-friendly”) data policies for years.","Academic researchers began publishing warnings that third-party Facebook apps represented a major possible source of privacy leakage in the early 2010s. Some noted that the privacy risks inherent in sharing data with apps were not at all clear to users. One group termed our new reality “interdependent privacy,” because your Facebook friends, in part, determine your own level of privacy.","For as long as apps have existed, they have asked for a lot of data and people have been prone to give it to them. Back in 2010, Penn State researchers systematically recorded what data the top 1,800 apps on Facebook were asking for. They presented their results in 2011 with the paper “Third-Party Apps on Facebook: Privacy and the Illusion of Control.” The table below shows that 148 apps were asking for permission to access friends’ information.","Pennsylvania State University","But that’s not the only way that friends leak their friends’ data. Take the example of letting an app see your photos. As the Penn State researchers show, all kinds of data can be harvested: who’s tagged in photos, who liked any of the pictures, who commented on them, and what they said.","If one were to systematically crawl through all the data that could be gleaned from just a user’s basic information, one could build a decent picture of that person’s social world, including a substantial amount of information about their friends.","Facebook has tightened up some of its policies in recent years, especially around apps accessing friends’ data. But TheGuardian’s reporting suggests that the company’s efforts to restuff Pandora’s box have been lax. Wylie, the whistleblower, received a letter from Facebook asking him to delete any Facebook data nearly two years after the existence of the data was first reported. “That to me was the most astonishing thing,” Wylie told The Guardian. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","But even if Facebook were maximally aggressive about policing this kind of situation, what’s done is done. It’s not just that the data escaped, but that Cambridge Analytica almost certainly learned everything they could from it. As stated in The Guardian, the contract between GSR and Strategic Communications Laboratories states, specifically, “The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information.”","It’s important to dwell on this. It’s not that this research was supposed to identify every U.S. voter just from this data, but rather to develop a method for sorting people based on Facebook’s profiles. Wylie believes that the data was crucial in building Cambridge Analytica’s models. It certainly seems possible that once the “training set” had been used to learn how to psychologically profile people, this specific data itself was no longer necessary. But the truth is that no one knows if the Kogan data had much use out in the real world of political campaigning. Psychological profiling sounds nefarious, but the way that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica first attempted to do it may well have proven, as the company maintains, “fruitless.”","So what is to be done? It’s possible that these new stories will cause Facebook to restrict the use of its data by people outside the company, including legitimate researchers. But that kind of self-imposed or external regulation would not strike at what’s actually scary about these efforts.","If Cambridge Analytica’s targeted advertising works, people worry they could be manipulated with information—or even thoughts—that they did not consent to giving anyone. And societally, a democracy running on micro-targeted political advertisements tuned specifically for ever tinier slices of the population is in trouble, as scholars like Zeynep Tufekci warned in 2012 (and in 2014).","Those two concerns extend far beyond Cambridge Analytica. In fact, the best system for micro-targeting ads, political or otherwise, to particularly persuadable segments of the population is Facebook itself. This is why Facebook’s market value is half a trillion dollars.","In Facebook’s ad system, there are no restrictions on sending ads to people based on any “targetable” attribute, like older men who are interested in the “Confederate States of America” and the National Rifle Association and who are “likely to engage with political content (conservative).”","A screenshot from Facebook’s ad-purchasing platform (Alexis Madrigal)","That’s to say nothing of the ability to create databases of people from other sources—electoral rolls, data on purchasing habits or group affiliations, or anything gleaned by the hundreds of online data companies—then letting Facebook itself match those people up to their Facebook accounts. Facebook might never reveal the names in an audience to advertisers or political campaigns, but the effects are the same.","Facebook’s laxity and the researcher’s malfeasance are newsworthy. But is the problem with privacy-obviating social networks, psychological profiling, and political micro-targeting that some researcher violated Facebook’s terms of service? Or is it that this controversy estranges the whole enterprise, providing a route to approach the almost unthinkable changes that have come to democratic processes in the Facebook era?","We want to hear what you think about this article.

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted.

Yet the donor secrecy laws which apply to Northern Ireland, and not\nthe rest of the UK, mean that citizens aren't allowed to know who gave all this\ncash.","Adam Ramsay and Peter Geoghegan\nhave been tirelessly following this story, which took a bizarre twist a few\nmonths ago when Channel 4 News doorstepped Richard Cook, chair of the secretive\ngroup that channelled the money to the DUP (watch it here). Their investigations also led to the discovery last month that MPs in Theresa May’s Tory party are using taxpayers cash (via\ntheir expense claims) to fund a hard-Brexit lobby group operating inside parliament.","May’s government has now announced it will end\ndonor secrecy in Northern Ireland, but has rejected calls to\nbackdate the law to 2014, so that the source of the DUP donation could be\nrevealed. Government and DUP sources have denied that this is ‘protection’ for\nthe DUP as part of their £1 billion deal to keep the Conservatives in power.","But there is far too little\nresource being spent on investigating these pressing issues – from the\nunder-funded Electoral Commission to the few journalists who are making it\ntheir business to find out more. Stories in Buzzfeed, Private Eye, and a\nFinancial Times investigation into the overlapping businesses of ‘King’ Arron\nBanks have\nhelped shed light on some of the questions that need to be asked. The\nresource is paltry compared to the scale of the task.","openDemocracy published on this subject because it helps to ask deeper questions about the strength of\nour democracy.","For more of the background, we invite you to listen to this panel\ndiscussion – Dark Money Deep Data – that on September 20, 2017 brought together\nPeter York, Carole Cadwalladr, Mary Fitzgerald and James Patrick – all journalists involved in shedding light on some of\nmodern politics’ murkiest corners – whether it is uncovering secret funding on the Brexit referendum; establishing clear\nconnections between wholesale voter targeting on social media and the US far\nright; or shedding new light on illegally-traded data, commercial hostile-bot\ncapability, and weaponised info wars.","Mary Fitzgerald","02.20 Business consultant and cultural commentator\nPeter York sets the scene explaining how advertisers have long sought to\nunderstand consumer behaviour, the better to segment markets and target\nmessaging.","16.00 Carole Cadwalladr, a features writer on The\nObserver, has published a series of articles revealing the secret links between\nleave.eu and the Vote Leave campaigns, and their connections to the US\nbillionaire Robert Mercer.","29.30 Mary Fitzgerald, openDemocracy’s\neditor-in-chief, managed the team behind revelations that the\nDUP spent more money campaigning for a leave vote in Great Britain than they\never had on an election in Northern Ireland.","38.45 James Patrick, whose book Alternative War was\nlaunched at the event, spoke about the linguistic commonalities in social media\nalt-right campaigning in both Britain and the US, and Russian investment in\ntargeted Facebook advertising, which is now being investigated in the US by the\nMueller enquiry.","Peter York:","“I do know where the dark arts derive from and I do know\nthat new technology has completely changed things irreversibly and very\nrecently too. So don’t ever listen to people who say, “ Oh fake news has been\ngoing on since the Romans!” New technology has enabled persuaders to mess with\nindividual and collective minds to a really unprecedented degree and to do it\nin secret...","‘Psychographics’ is the business of understanding people in\nterms of their personalities, their\nconcerns, their attitudes, rather than just the pretty crude but useful idea of\ndemographics, age, class, gender, income, geography – all important in their\nway. My employer back then was interested in understanding very sophisticated\nmarket segmentations – another bit of ‘newspeke’ – that grouped people usefully\nas targets – targets for new product development, for branding or for messaging\non the basis of what went on in their heads...","Computers helped us do this grouping in terms of analyses\nthat showed us relationships, clusters\nof attitudes that went together… You hated\nx and you loved y. The objective was to\nmake people easier to target with appeals that worked emotionally as well as\nrationally, things that played on their fears and aspirations…","PR was much less developed then: everybody in the world\ndidn’t work in PR, and it was very imprecise and very imperfectly Orwellian…","The reality remained by today’s standards fantastically imprecise. We longed to be the ‘real hidden persuaders’ that\npeople called ‘awful’ and ‘spooky’ – but we couldn’t do it….","New technology has completely liberated and weaponised those\nsorts of vested interests, those commercial and political players, by making it\npossible to target precisely online. Psychographics has been taken up by\nFacebook which analyses you by your likes. It gives a fantastically accurate\npicture of a person and then offers you up to advertisers on a plate and also\nall sorts of new organisations which hold all sorts of information about\neveryone: individuals, small groups – and huge groups, very precisely and very\nquickly! It comes fantastically\npersistently. Bots don’t sleep...","And it is unseen. They do it very secretly, unaccountably\nbut plausibly.”","Carole Cadwalladr:","“ This is being taken\nvery seriously in America. There are something like 17 agencies looking at this\nand the FBI investigation is coming down with a lot of focus on what happened\nwith the data. These are all live\nquestions that are being investigated right now in America, but they are not\nbeing investigated in Britain. It is a bizarre, weird absence that we in\nthe UK do seem to be in denial about the fact that our democracy has been\nsubverted by outside actors and billionaires and potentially foreign nations.\nWe don’t know. In America they have got Facebook in front of a committee\nand they ask them questions… That is a private company unaccountable,\nunregulated...","An American academic, Jonathan Albright had been studying\nthe ‘fake news’ eco-system. He said this isn’t teenagers making up little\nstories: this is a whole network which has taken over our whole news and\ninformation system and is literally strangling it. Cambridge Analytica wasn’t\nsome little data start-up in Shoreditch. It was actually this British military\nfirm which had been working in places like Iraq and Ukraine for thirty years\nand using technology which had been paid for and developed by the military to\nsubdue civilian populations, and out of this same company, using the same\ntechnology they were now using it on the electorate definitely in America and\nso they said before, in Britain. Eventually Leave.EU said – they did work for us\nbut we didn’t pay them…”","“It took me quite a long time to get the bottom of this and\nto stand this up… we know that Aggregate IQ is connected to Cambridge Analytica.\nWe know that Robert Mercer who is the owner of Cambridge Analytica also owns\nthe IP of Aggregate IQ. We know that it is illegal for campaigns to coordinate\nbut here were the two major Leave campaigns working with the company owned by\nthis one US billionaire… We have UK electoral law about managing the money and\nhaving an even playing field, and there is really good evidence that it wasn’t\nan even playing field…","But we are pawns\nin a game that we don’t really understand. Politics is supposed to be about\nhaving a debate. It is about consensus. We agree on the results of the election\nin that case. But this is so fundamentally different. We don’t know how people\nwere targeted and we have no way of finding out… Our news and information\nsystem and our democracy is broken. This needs an emergency taskforce.”","James Patrick:","“In Sweden, domestic extremism comes from the right wing and\nthat made me start to have a broader look not only at the narratives across\nEurope related to refugee movements and local crime which we had actually seen\nin Brexit, but also the way that fake news and disinformation works...","You could look at this and you could see a certain pattern\nacross Europe: ‘immigration is bad; immigrants are bad; crime increases with\nimmigrants.’ You could look at this and\nit was always coming from certain quarters. In Sweden you could actually see\nthat it was always coming from the Sweden Democrats who were the far right\nlocal party and you could identify that they had long term funding links with\nRussia… Marine Le Pen was loaned £9 and a half million by a Russian bank which\nthen folded… You can trace her narrative and her connections to Nigel Farage,\nto the Sweden Democrats and everything else…","Then I looked at the messages we had on twitter through the\nBrexit referendum… and then I looked at the US and the messages were so similar\nthat you couldn’t get away from it. I looked at Cambridge Analytica who came up\nagain and again, and they just had money churned at them…","What’s happened is that you can’t just go to a country and\nsay, “Right I want all rightwing people to vote this way”. You have to use\ncompanies like Cambridge Analytica for ‘a pre-assessment’… and you farm out\nwhat they learn to an outside interest, and you use that outside interest to\ntweak what they were seeing… .”","About the authors","Mary Fitzgerald is Editor-in-Chief of openDemocracy.

Because I know that they could have prevented it.’\nPhotograph: Robert Gumpert","Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.","Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.","Where's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds","Read more","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.","Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

As publisher and later chairman of The Post, I watched the rise of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, sometimes with hope, sometimes with awe and sometimes with horror for what it meant to The Post’s business.","To start with the basics: The big technology companies ought to obey the laws that apply to all businesses. They should pay their taxes and comply with antitrust laws. If they make mistakes, they should admit them quickly and act transparently to fix them. Facebook, in particular, faces a huge challenge in convincing its users that they can trust it to safeguard their data.","So why not regulate these companies more? First: Google and Facebook are platforms where a great deal of today’s political speech and reporting of news takes place, and regulation is an inherently political act. If you want a Technology Company Regulation Commission, its chairman and its members will be appointed by presidents and will reflect their policies.","Do presidents really play a role in regulation or enforcement? Well, you can listen to the Watergate tapes and hear President ­Richard Nixon direct his advisers John Dean and H.R. Haldeman to use the Federal Communications Commission’s regulatory process to take away TV stations owned by The Washington Post Co. Challenges to stations’ licenses by Nixon supporters did ensue and, had Nixon not resigned, they would have been heard by an FCC led by the former chairman of the Republican National Committee . It is difficult to convince me that regulation is apolitical.","If you want Google, Facebook and other tech companies regulated, you are asking for a system in which President Trump — or (perhaps in the future) President Elizabeth Warren — plays a role in deciding what goes on your Facebook page or what flows from your Google search. Is that really what you want?","And how do you argue that government should be able to regulate speech on YouTube but not your own speech, or that of The Post?","Second: I worked in regulated industries for years, and regulation can be fairly described as odd. Regulators often do not or cannot talk face-to-face with those being regulated to understand the consequences of what they are doing. The conversation is conducted through lawyers on both sides. Is there a set of regulators in Washington who would understand how Google or Facebook is put together?","Facebook and Google argue they have one goal in their principal businesses: innovating to satisfy their customers. Regulation introduces a different goal: not offending the regulators. Technology companies must move fast; regulation slows things down, sometimes drastically. Almost inevitably, this hurts a company’s performance. Money, time and, above all, management attention that might be focused on innovation and satisfying customers are focused elsewhere.","From the day it began accepting advertising, Facebook has walked a line, sometimes carefully, sometimes not. It promised advertisers the ability to target ads at users who were interested in their products; it promised users that their data would be private. Careful compromises should have been able to maintain trust with both sets of users.","The most important control over Facebook — greater than anything governments could come up with — is the ability of its users to quit. Zuckerberg has a huge incentive to keep our data private and to prove that Facebook has done so (the standards that permitted Cambridge Analytica to access user data were changed three years ago). Facebook needs to go to any possible length to convince its irritated users that it can be trusted.","Taken together, the big tech companies constitute a rare area where America leads the world. If you don’t believe they are important to the country, look at how they are treated elsewhere. In Europe, the home of many unsuccessful competitors, they are fined and regulated not because they are lawbreakers, but because they are American. And in China, Facebook and Google — as well as Twitter, YouTube and Wikipedia — are banned because they encourage free speech and free thought.","Instead, the Chinese have created massive competitors such as Tencent and Baidu, sheltered from Western competition in their enormous home market. If Google and Facebook slow down — remember that most of the world’s users are outside the United States — these competitors will easily pass them by.","Will it be an aid to your privacy to search on Baidu or share on Tencent? I don’t think so.","I hope the technology companies are wise enough to take the measures needed to convince users that they care about their privacy. And I hope our country is wise enough not to regulate them."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

That is where the fight happens.”","Facebook announced it had suspended Cambridge Analytica on Saturday, stripping it of its ability to buy ads, as U.S. and British lawmakers called for government investigations.","The social media giant said approximately 270,000 people had downloaded an app developed by University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, who it said “lied” and violated its policy by gathering user data and passing it on to Cambridge Analytica.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” Facebook said in its statement. “We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.”","Wylie, a self-proclaimed whistleblower, said Facebook banned him from its platform as well after he disclosed information that he claimed “they have known privately for two years.”","Cambridge Analytica denied any wrongdoing, including claims that it used or held onto Facebook data, but Wylie’s description of his work there told a different story.","“We would ask people to fill out psychological surveys,” he said, “That app would then harvest their data from Facebook.

{"originalurl":"https://a.msn.com/r/2/BBKse5k?m=en-us&ocid=News","title":"How Facebook Made Its Cambridge Analytica Data Crisis Even Worse","text":["The company knew ahead of time that on Saturday, the New York Times and The Guardian’s Observer would issue bombshell reports that the data firm that helped Donald Trump win the presidency had accessed and retained information on 50 million Facebook users without their permission.","Lawmakers want to question Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg about a data leak that exposed about 50 million user accounts.","Facebook did two things to protect itself: it sent letters to the media firms laying out its legal case for why this data leak didn’t constitute a \"breach.\" And then it scooped the reports using their information, with a Friday blog post on why it was suspending the ad firm, Cambridge Analytica, from its site.","Both moves backfired.","On Friday, Facebook said it \"received reports\" that Cambridge Analytica hadn’t deleted the user data, and that it needed to suspend the firm. The statement gave the impression that Facebook had looked into the matter. In fact, the company’s decisions were stemming from information in the news reports set to publish the next day, and it had not independently verified those reports, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. By trying to look proactive, Facebook ended up adding weight to the news.","On Saturday, any good will the company earned by talking about the problem first was quickly undone when reporters revealed Facebook’s behind-the-scenes legal maneuvering. “Yesterday Facebook threatened to sue us. Today we publish this,” Carole Cadwalladr, the Observer reporter, wrote as she linked her story to Twitter, in a post shared almost 15,000 times. The Guardian said it had nothing to add to her statement. The Times confirmed that it too received a letter, but said it didn’t consider the correspondence a legal threat.","Front-running the stories along with the letters to newsrooms are but two of several ways Facebook failed to contain fallout from the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Silence on the part of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg didn’t help. Nor did a report late Monday in the New York Times that Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos is leaving after clashing with other executives, including Sandberg, over how Facebook handled Russian disinformation campaigns. Facebook said Stamos is still at the company, but didn’t outright deny that he plans to leave.","“Most of its executives haven’t done a real interview in ages, let alone answer deep questions,” Zeynep Tufecki, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who specializes in social networks and democracy, wrote in a post on Twitter.","In a sign of investor dismay, Facebook shares tumbled 6.8 percent on Monday, the biggest decline since March 2014. As the stock fell and criticism from lawmakers poured in from the U.S. and Britain, the company worked to make it clear that it didn’t actually have enough information, on its own, to react to Saturday’s news reports in a stronger way.","Facebook put out another blog post, saying that Cambridge Analytica and the researcher who provided them the data, Aleksandr Kogan, had agreed to a digital forensics audit to prove they deleted it. Facebook said the one person who didn’t agree to the audit was Christopher Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica contractor who spoke to the newspapers about the data leak. With the post, Facebook aimed to stir more skepticism around Wylie’s information, according to a person familiar with the matter.","That didn’t resolve things quickly either. The auditors were already on site at Cambridge Analytica’s London office Monday when they had to pause their work. The U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation.","The Cambridge Analytica saga is the latest in a series of bungled Facebook responses, often reactionary and sometimes unintentionally stirring public outrage instead of resolving concerns. The company’s interaction with the public tends to start with a carefully crafted blog post, and then evolve into a much more improvised Twitter-based conversation with lower-level executives who defend the social network and explain its decisions. It doesn’t always go well.","Earlier this year, when the U.S. government indicted 13 Russians who used Facebook to manipulate voters, a Facebook advertising executive took to Twitter to clarify that overall, the Russian ads were primarily used to divide Americans, not influence the election. His comments went viral after President Donald Trump used them to back up attacks on the \"fake news media.\"","In 2017, Facebook made its disclosures on Russia’s activities in a slow drip, each time illustrating a bigger problem. An April white paper on \"information operations,\" for example, didn’t name the country. The company that October said 10 million users saw Russia’s ads. Later that month, Facebook said 126 million people saw Russia’s posts in general. The company upped the number to 150 million during Congressional interrogation, when a senator asked if Facebook could include Instagram, the photo-sharing app it owns, in the count.","Stamos, who has favored more forthright disclosure, was frequently outvoted, according to the New York Times. He’s planning to leave the company in August, the newspaper reported. On Twitter, he later said he’s still fully engaged with his work at Facebook, without answering questions about his plans. But that would make him the most high-profile exit since Facebook’s election-related troubles began.","Meanwhile, higher ranking executives remain quiet. Zuckerberg and Sandberg, who in past years would post frequently about the issues of the day, have shied away from reacting to the most controversial news. Lawmakers have now called out Zuckerberg by name in both the U.S. and the U.K.","Zuckerberg and Sandberg plan to remain quiet on the Cambridge Analytica situation until the company completes its internal review of what happened, according to a person familiar with the matter. Until they do, questions about Facebook’s ability to cope with the Cambridge Analytica crisis will undoubtedly persist.","To contact the reporter on this story: Sarah Frier in San Francisco at sfrier1@bloomberg.net.","To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Tom Giles, Peter Elstrom"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Hugh Hefner, Playboy’s publisher, threw a pool party for the show’s contestants with dozens of current and former Playmates, including Karen McDougal, a slim brunette who had been named Playmate of the Year, eight years earlier. In 2001, the magazine’s readers voted her runner-up for “Playmate of the ’90s,” behind Pamela Anderson. At the time of the party, Trump had been married to the Slovenian model Melania Knauss for less than two years; their son, Barron, was a few months old. Trump seemed uninhibited by his new family obligations. McDougal later wrote that Trump “immediately took a liking to me, kept talking to me - telling me how beautiful I was, etc. It was so obvious that a Playmate Promotions exec said, ‘Wow, he was all over you - I think you could be his next wife.’ ”","Trump and McDougal began an affair, which McDougal later memorialized in an eight-page, handwritten document provided to The New Yorker by John Crawford, a friend of McDougal’s. When I showed McDougal the document, she expressed surprise that I had obtained it but confirmed that the handwriting was her own.","The interactions that McDougal outlines in the document share striking similarities with the stories of other women who claim to have had sexual relationships with Trump, or who have accused him of propositioning them for sex or sexually harassing them. McDougal describes their affair as entirely consensual. But her account provides a detailed look at how Trump and his allies used clandestine hotel-room meetings, payoffs, and complex legal agreements to keep affairs—sometimes multiple affairs he carried out simultaneously—out of the press.","On November 4, 2016, four days before the election, the Wall Street Journal reported that American Media, Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer, had paid a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for exclusive rights to McDougal’s story, which it never ran. Purchasing a story in order to bury it is a practice that many in the tabloid industry call “catch and kill.” This is a favorite tactic of the C.E.O. and chairman of A.M.I., David Pecker, who describes the President as “a personal friend.” As part of the agreement, A.M.I. consented to publish a regular aging-and-fitness column by McDougal. After Trump won the Presidency, however, A.M.I.’s promises largely went unfulfilled, according to McDougal. Last month, the Journal reported that Trump’s personal lawyer had negotiated a separate agreement just before the election with an adult-film actress named Stephanie Clifford, whose screen name is Stormy Daniels, which barred her from discussing her own affair with Trump. Since then, A.M.I. has repeatedly approached McDougal about extending her contract.","McDougal, in her first on-the-record comments about A.M.I.’s handling of her story, declined to discuss the details of her relationship with Trump, for fear of violating the agreement she reached with the company. She did say, however, that she regretted signing the contract. “It took my rights away,” McDougal told me. “At this point I feel I can’t talk about anything without getting into trouble, because I don’t know what I’m allowed to talk about. I’m afraid to even mention his name.”","A White House spokesperson said in a statement that Trump denies having had an affair with McDougal: “This is an old story that is just more fake news. The President says he never had a relationship with McDougal.” A.M.I. said that an amendment to McDougal’s contract—signed after Trump won the election—allowed her to “respond to legitimate press inquiries” regarding the affair. The company said that it did not print the story because it did not find it credible.","Six former A.M.I. employees told me that Pecker routinely makes catch-and-kill arrangements like the one reached with McDougal. “We had stories and we bought them knowing full well they were never going to run,” Jerry George, a former A.M.I. senior editor who worked at the company for more than twenty-five years, told me. George said that Pecker protected Trump. “Pecker really considered him a friend,” George told me. “We never printed a word about Trump without his approval.” Maxine Page, who worked at A.M.I. on and off from 2002 to 2012, including as an executive editor at one of the company’s Web sites, said that Pecker also used the unpublished stories as “leverage” over some celebrities in order to pressure them to pose for his magazines or feed him stories. Several former employees said that these celebrities included Arnold Schwarzenegger, as reported by Los Angeles Magazine, and Tiger Woods. (Schwarzenegger, through an attorney, denied this claim. Woods did not respond to requests for comment.) “Even though they’re just tabloids, just rags, it’s still a cause of concern,” Page said. “In theory, you would think that Trump has all the power in that relationship, but in fact Pecker has the power—he has the power to run these stories. He knows where the bodies are buried.”","As the pool party at the Playboy Mansion came to an end, Trump asked for McDougal’s telephone number. For McDougal, who grew up in a small town in Michigan and worked as a preschool teacher before beginning her modelling career, such advances were not unusual. John Crawford, McDougal’s friend, who also helped broker her deal with A.M.I., said that Trump was “another powerful guy hitting on her, a gal who’s paid to be at work.” Trump and McDougal began talking frequently on the phone, and soon had what McDougal described as their first date: dinner in a private bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. McDougal wrote that Trump impressed her. “I was so nervous! I was into his intelligence + charm. Such a polite man,” she wrote. “We talked for a couple hours – then, it was “ON”! We got naked + had sex.” As McDougal was getting dressed to leave, Trump did something that surprised her. “He offered me money,” she wrote. “I looked at him (+ felt sad) + said, ‘No thanks - I’m not ‘that girl.’ I slept w/you because I like you - NOT for money’ - He told me ‘you are special.’ ”","Afterward, McDougal wrote, she “went to see him every time he was in LA (which was a lot).” Trump, she said, always stayed in the same bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel and ordered the same meal—steak and mashed potatoes—and never drank. McDougal’s account is consistent with other descriptions of Trump’s behavior. Last month, In Touch Weekly published an interview conducted in 2011 with Stephanie Clifford in which she revealed that during a relationship with Trump she met him for dinner at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Trump insisted they watch “Shark Week” on the Discovery Channel. Summer Zervos, a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” alleged that Trump assaulted her at a private dinner meeting, in December of 2007, at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Trump, Zervos has claimed, kissed her, groped her breast, and suggested that they lie down to “watch some telly-telly.” After Zervos rebuffed Trump’s advances, she said that he “began thrusting his genitals” against her. (Zervos recently sued Trump for defamation after he denied her account.) All three women say that they were escorted to a bungalow at the hotel by a Trump bodyguard, whom two of the women have identified as Keith Schiller. After Trump was elected, Schiller was appointed director of Oval Office Operations and deputy assistant to the President. Last September, John Kelly, acting as the new chief of staff, removed Schiller from the White House posts. (Schiller did not respond to a request for comment.)","Over the course of the affair, Trump flew McDougal to public events across the country but hid the fact that he paid for her travel. “No paper trails for him,” she wrote. “In fact, every time I flew to meet him, I booked/paid for flight + hotel + he reimbursed me.” In July, 2006, McDougal joined Trump at the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship, at the Edgewood Resort, on Lake Tahoe. At a party there, she and Trump sat in a booth with the New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, and Trump told her that Brees had recognized her, remarking, “Baby, you’re popular.” (Brees, through a spokesman, denied meeting Trump or McDougal at the event.) At another California golf event, Trump told McDougal that Tiger Woods had asked who she was. Trump, she recalled, warned her “to stay away from that one, LOL.”","During the Lake Tahoe tournament, McDougal and Trump had sex, she wrote. He also allegedly began a sexual relationship with Clifford at the event. (A representative for Clifford did not respond to requests for comment.) In the 2011 interview with In Touch Weekly, Clifford said that Trump didn’t use a condom and didn’t mention sleeping with anyone else. Another adult-film actress, whose screen name is Alana Evans, claimed that Trump invited her to join them in his hotel room that weekend. A third adult-film performer, known as Jessica Drake, alleged that Trump asked her to his hotel room, met her and two women she brought with her in pajamas, and then “grabbed each of us tightly in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking for permission.” He then offered Drake ten thousand dollars in exchange for her company. (Trump denied the incident.) A week after the golf tournament, McDougal joined Trump at the fifty-fifth Miss Universe contest, in Los Angeles. She sat near him, and later attended an after-party where she met celebrities. Trump also set aside tickets for Clifford, as he did at a later vodka launch that both women attended.","During Trump’s relationship with McDougal, she wrote, he introduced her to members of his family and took her to his private residences. At a January, 2007, launch party in Los Angeles for Trump’s now-defunct liquor brand, Trump Vodka, McDougal, who was photographed entering the event, recalled sitting at a table with Kim Kardashian, Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., and Trump, Jr.,’s wife, Vanessa, who was pregnant. At one point, Trump held a party for “The Apprentice” at the Playboy Mansion, and McDougal worked as a costumed Playboy bunny. “We took pics together, alone + with his family,” McDougal wrote. She recalled that Trump said he had asked his son Eric “who he thought was the most beautiful girl here + Eric pointed me. Mr. T said ‘He has great taste’ + we laughed!” Trump gave McDougal tours of Trump Tower and his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. In Trump Tower, McDougal wrote, Trump pointed out Melania’s separate bedroom. He “said she liked her space,” McDougal wrote, “to read or be alone.”","McDougal’s account, like those of Clifford and other women who have described Trump’s advances, conveys a man preoccupied with his image. McDougal recalled that Trump would often send her articles about him or his daughter, as well as signed books and sun visors from his golf courses. Clifford recalled Trump remarking that she and Ivanka were similar and proudly showing her a copy of a “money magazine” with his image on the cover.","Trump also promised to buy McDougal an apartment in New York as a Christmas present. Clifford, likewise, said that Trump promised to buy her a condo in Tampa. For Trump, showing off real estate and other branded products was sometimes a prelude to sexual advances. Zervos and a real-estate investor named Rachel Crooks have both claimed that Trump kissed them on the mouth during professional encounters at Trump Tower. Four other women have claimed that Trump forcibly touched or kissed them during tours or events at Mar-a-Lago, his property in Palm Beach, Florida. (Trump has denied any wrongdoing pertaining to the women.)","McDougal ended the relationship in April, 2007, after nine months. According to Crawford, the breakup was prompted in part by McDougal’s feelings of guilt. “She couldn’t look at herself in the mirror anymore,” Crawford said. “And she was concerned about what her mother thought of her.” The decision was reinforced by a series of comments Trump made that McDougal found disrespectful, according to several of her friends. When she raised her concern about her mother’s disapproval to Trump, he replied, “What, that old hag?” (McDougal, hurt, pointed out that Trump and her mother were close in age.) On the night of the Miss Universe pageant McDougal attended, McDougal and a friend rode with Trump in his limousine and the friend mentioned a relationship she had had with an African-American man. According to multiple sources, Trump remarked that the friend liked “the big black dick” and began commenting on her attractiveness and breast size. The interactions angered the friend and deeply offended McDougal.","Speaking carefully for fear of legal reprisal, McDougal responded to questions about whether she felt guilty about the affair, as her friends suggested, by saying that she had found God in the last several years and regretted parts of her past. “This is a new me,” she told me. “If I could go back and do a lot of things differently, I definitely would.”","McDougal readily admitted that she voluntarily sold the rights to her story, but she and sources close to her insisted that the way the sale unfolded was exploitative. Crawford told me that selling McDougal’s story was his idea, and that he first raised it when she was living with him, in 2016. “She and I were sitting at the house, and I’m watching him on television,” Crawford said, referring to Trump. “I said, ‘You know, if you had a physical relationship with him, that could be worth something about now.’ And I looked at her and she had that guilty look on her face.”","McDougal, who says she is a Republican, told me that she was reluctant at first to tell her story, because she feared that other Trump supporters might accuse her of fabricating it, or might even harm her or her family. She also said that she didn’t want to get involved in the heated Presidential contest. “I didn’t want to influence anybody’s election,” she told me. “I didn’t want death threats on my head.” Crawford was only able to persuade her to consider speaking about the relationship after a former friend of McDougal’s began posting about the affair on social media. “I didn’t want someone else telling stories and getting all the details wrong,” McDougal said.","Crawford called a friend who had worked in the adult-film industry who he thought might have media connections, and asked whether a story about Trump having an affair would “be worth something.” That friend, Crawford recalled, was “like a hobo on a ham sandwich” and contacted an attorney named Keith M. Davidson, who also had contacts in the adult-film industry and ties to media companies, including A.M.I. Davidson had developed a track record of selling salacious stories. A slide show on the clients page of his Web site includes Sara Leal, who claimed to have slept with the actor Ashton Kutcher while he was married to Demi Moore. Davidson told Crawford that McDougal’s story would be worth “millions.” (Davidson did not respond to a request for comment.)","Dozens of pages of e-mails, texts, and legal documents obtained by The New Yorker reveal how the transaction evolved. Davidson got in touch with A.M.I., and on June 20, 2016, he and McDougal met Dylan Howard, A.M.I.’s chief content officer. E-mails between Howard and Davidson show that A.M.I. initially had little interest in the story. Crawford said that A.M.I.’s first offer was ten thousand dollars.","After Trump won the Republican nomination, however, A.M.I. increased its offer. In an August, 2016, e-mail exchange, Davidson encouraged McDougal to sign the deal. McDougal, worried that she would be prevented from talking about a Presidential nominee, asked questions about the nuances of the contract. Davidson responded, “If you deny, you are safe.” He added, “We really do need to get this signed and wrapped up...”","McDougal, who has a new lawyer, Carol Heller, told me that she did not understand the scope of the agreement when she signed it. “I knew that I couldn’t talk about any alleged affair with any married man, but I didn’t really understand the whole content of what I gave up,” she told me.","On August 5, 2016, McDougal signed a limited life-story rights agreement granting A.M.I. exclusive ownership of her account of any romantic, personal, or physical relationship she has ever had with any “then-married man.” Her retainer with Davidson makes explicit that the man in question was Donald Trump. In exchange, A.M.I. agreed to pay her a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The three men involved in the deal—Davidson, Crawford, and their intermediary in the adult-film industry—took forty-five per cent of the payment as fees, leaving McDougal with a total of eighty-two thousand five hundred dollars, billing records from Davidson’s office show. “I feel let down,” McDougal told me. “I’m the one who took it, so it’s my fault, too. But I didn’t understand the full parameters of it.” McDougal terminated her representation by Davidson, but a photograph of McDougal in a bathing suit is still featured prominently on his Web site—according to McDougal, without her permission. The Wall Street Journal reported that, two months after McDougal signed the agreement with A.M.I., Davidson negotiated a nondisclosure agreement between Clifford and Trump’s longtime personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars. (On Tuesday, Cohen told the Times that he had facilitated the deal with Daniels and paid the money out of his own pocket. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.)","As voters went to the polls on Election Day, Howard and A.M.I.’s general counsel were on the phone with McDougal and a law firm representing her, promising to boost McDougal’s career and offering to employ a publicist to help her handle interviews. E-mails show that, a year into the contract, the company suggested it might collaborate with McDougal on a skin-care line and a documentary devoted to a medical cause that she cares about, neither of which has come about. The initial contract also called for A.M.I. to publish regular columns by McDougal on aging and wellness, and to “prominently feature” her on two magazine covers. She has appeared on one cover and is in discussions about another, but in the past seventeen months the company has published only a fraction of the almost one hundred promised columns. “They blew her off for a long time,” Crawford said. A.M.I. said that McDougal had not delivered the promised columns.","A.M.I. responded quickly, however, when journalists tried to interview McDougal. In May, 2017, The New Yorker’s Jeffrey Toobin, who was writing a profile of David Pecker, asked McDougal for comment about her relationships with A.M.I. and Trump. Howard, of A.M.I., working with a publicist retained by the company, forwarded McDougal a draft response with the subject line “SEND THIS.” In August, 2017, Pecker flew McDougal to New York and the two had lunch, during which he thanked her for her loyalty. A few days later, Howard followed up by e-mail, summarizing the plans that had been discussed, including the possibility of McDougal hosting A.M.I.’s coverage of awards shows such as the Golden Globes, Grammys, and Oscars. None of that work materialized. (A.M.I. said that those conversations related to future contracts, not her current one.)","A.M.I.’s interest in McDougal seemed to increase after news broke of Trump’s alleged affair with Clifford. Howard sent an e-mail suggesting that McDougal undergo media training, and a few days later suggested that she could host coverage of the Emmys for OK! Magazine. In an e-mail on January 30th, A.M.I.’s general counsel, Cameron Stracher, talked about renewing her contract and putting her on a new magazine cover. The subject line of the e-mail read, “McDougal contract extension.” Crawford told me, “They got worried that she was going to start talking again, and they came running to her.”","Several people close to McDougal argued that such untold stories could be used as leverage against the President. “I’m sixty-two years old,” Crawford said. “I know how the world goes round.” Without commenting on Trump specifically, McDougal conceded that she had a growing awareness of the broader implications of the President’s situation. “Someone in a high position that controls our country, if they can influence him,” she said, “it’s a big deal.” In a statement, A.M.I. denied that it had any leverage over Trump: “The suggestion that AMI holds any influence over the President of the United States, while flattering, is laughable.”","McDougal fears that A.M.I. will retaliate for her public comments by seeking financial damages in a private arbitration process mandated by a clause of her contract. But she said that changes in her life and the emergence of the #MeToo moment had prompted her to speak. In January, 2017, McDougal had her breast implants removed, citing declining health that she believed to be connected to the implants. McDougal said that confronting illness, and embracing a cause she wanted to speak about, made her feel increasingly conflicted about the moral compromises of silence. “As I was sick and feeling like I was dying and bedridden, all I could do was pray to live. But now I pray to live right, and make right with the wrongs that I have done,” she told me. McDougal also cited the actions of women who have come forward in recent months to describe abuses by high-profile men. “I know it’s a different circumstance,” she said, “but I just think I feel braver.” McDougal told me that she hoped speaking out might convince others to wait before signing agreements like hers. “Every girl who speaks,” she said, “is paving the way for another.”","Due to editing errors, an earlier version of this story misstated the legal name of the adult-film actress Alana Evans and the publication that first reported allegations that A.M.I. used unpublished stories as leverage over Arnold Schwarzenegger. The number of published McDougal columns has also been updated."],"isopubdate":""}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

The study looked at people arguing politics on Twitter and, as I could have told them, people do not change their political views based upon arguments on line. Here is the abstract:","There is mounting concern that social media sites contribute to political polarization by creating “echo chambers” that insulate people from opposing views about current events. We surveyed a large sample of Democrats and Republicans who visit Twitter at least three times each week about a range of social policy issues. One week later, we randomly assigned respondents to a treatment condition in which they were offered financial incentives to follow a Twitter bot for one month that exposed them to messages produced by elected officials, organizations, and other opinion leaders with opposing political ideologies. Respondents were re-surveyed at the end of the month to measure the effect of this treatment, and at regular intervals throughout the study period to monitor treatment compliance. We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative post-treatment, and Democrats who followed a conservative Twitter bot became slightly more liberal post-treatment. These findings have important implications for the interdisciplinary literature on political polarization as well as the emerging field of computational social science.","It is very doubtful that people changed their view of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump based upon Russian bots or anything else they read on Twitter.","I bet that the same would apply to Facebook. Of course there are also multiple other reasons to question the claims that Russian bots or others caused Clinton to lose, as I most recently discussed in this post. Censoring social media, as Hillary Clinton has been suggesting, and Facebook has been practicing, would serve no positive purpose. There are obviously strong reasons to resist such censorship, although establishment Democrats appear oblivious to the impact on civil liberties.","2 Comments","I won’t condone such hacking, but if the Russians did release the email to Wikileaks, I also wouldn’t accept this as a case of Russia causing Clinton to lose. The email exposed factual information regarding the dishonesty and corruption of Clinton and the DNC–information we already knew. They deserve the blame for the loss if this information harmed her in the election."],"isopubdate":"2018-09-17"}

Its business model is built on gathering data. It knows your real name, who your friends are, your likes and interests, where you have been, what websites you have visited, what you look like and how you speak.","It uses all that data to make it super easy for its customers – advertisers – to target you.","On the other hand, Facebook very much wants to keep that data – its competitive advantage – to itself, and so guards it carefully. Facebook has yet to face a major hack like Yahoo, Equifax or LinkedIn.","So protective is the site of its user data that it makes it very difficult for scholars to study its impact on society.","Unfortunately for researchers, the newly reported misappropriation of data is likely to make that even harder. The 50m user profiles were harvested by a Cambridge University researcher, Aleksandr Kogan – separately from his work at the university – but passed to Cambridge Analytica for ad targeting purposes – a violation of Facebook policies.","“This is about a company breaking Facebook’s terms of service and going rogue,” said Sarah T Roberts, a UCLA assistant professor of information studies. “That’s a pitfall that will exist no matter what policies are implemented.","It is not clear what the legal implications are for Kogan and Cambridge Analytica, and for Facebook, which discovered the unauthorised use of its data in 2015.","Kogan has denied he did anything wrong – so has Cambridge Analytica, which issued a statement on Saturday in which it said it fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.","“Facebook is trying to walk the line between saying that it was not a breach so they aren’t liable, but at the same time they are saying that the data use was unauthorised,” said Tiffany Li, resident fellow at Yale Law School’s Information Society Project.","“It’s an interesting legal strategy, but whether it will work for them is another question.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Though Facebook claims Cambridge Analytica and its associates broke the rules in retaining and using this data, this wasn’t a breach as we typically think of them: The Times reported that 270,000 of those users willingly gave over their info when they signed up for a personality quiz app.","Developers can request to see your relationship status, education history, and religious and political beliefs, among many other data points, but only if you allow them. For example, I had unknowingly shared all of my Facebook photos and photos tagged of me with TripAdvisor. A hiking app called AllTrails could see all of the timeline posts, while Waze had access to my custom friend lists (including one named “Frenemies”). In any case, now would be a good time to revisit the third-party apps you’ve granted permission to access your Facebook data and review — and maybe revoke — some of the info you’re sharing.","Alternatively, on the desktop interface, click the downward arrow in the top-right corner and select Settings. Then select Apps from the menu. On the apps page, you’ll see all the apps where you’ve logged into Facebook. On mobile, tap the menu bar (bottom-right for iOS, top-right for Android), and select Settings > Account Settings > Apps > Logged in with Facebook.","Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News","Remove third-party apps you no longer use by hovering over the icon and clicking the \"X.\"","Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News","You can also adjust the amount of information you hand over to an app by clicking the edit button.","Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News","You can limit an app’s permissions without fully revoking it. Click on the edit button (pencil icon), next to the remove button, to view each app’s individual settings, where you can see all of the data that’s visible to the app. You can revoke specific permissions by deselecting the checkmark next to each data point.","Third-party apps may have already stored data on you, and you’ll need to contact the app developer to delete that information.","You can do this on Facebook in the app’s individual settings page. On the bottom right-hand corner of the settings window, click on Report App. Then select, I want to send my own message to the developer. There, you can request that they remove any information they have stored. It’s not a guarantee, however, that they will respect your request.","Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News","Look at the app’s privacy policy to see more details about how that app is using your data.","In the same row of links in tiny font next to Report App, click on App Privacy Policy, which will take you to the app’s website. There will be a lot of legal mumbo jumbo in here, so just search (command + F) for “Facebook” or “social networks” to go straight to the section that covers integration with social networks.","Another thing to look at on Facebook’s app settings page: Apps Others Use.","This module is near the bottom of the page, underneath the third-party app icons. Click Edit to control what your friends on Facebook can bring with them when they enable third-party apps. Deselect the personal info you don’t want to share.","Your friends could be sharing your religious and political views or what you’re interested in, without your knowledge (or theirs).","If you want to download a copy of all your data, that’s an option, too.","You can download all of your Facebook data — including posts, photos, videos, messages, chats, and your “about” section — by going to Settings and in General, clicking Download a copy of your Facebook data.","The ultimate takeaway is: Review app permissions, not just on Facebook, but forall social media sites, and look closely at what information you’re allowing third-party apps to see.","Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News","Facebook's privacy policy changes from time to time (as former Facebook executive Alex Stamos pointed out in now-deleted tweets), so re-check your third-party app settings regularly, to make sure you're only sharing information what you want to be sharing.

This brought us to the era of the Cloud Czars, companies that invested billions in the infrastructure of information delivery and nothing in the information itself.","Of all the Cloud Czars, Facebook made itself uniquely vulnerable. It was the youngest by far, born in 2004. It was the most aggressive, building cloud data centers before sales even hit the $1 billion/quarter mark required to play the game. It was also the most dependent on advertising. It claimed to be a “platform,” not responsible for what users might say or do, the way a phone company isn’t responsible for what you say on its lines.","Facebook was the product of a “cyber-libertarian” moment, the attitude that “West Coast Law” would make “East Coast Law” irrelevant. Facebook gave us Peter Thiel and “Bro’ Culture.” This was a 14-year old Ayn Rand fan’s naivete, the idea that we need never protect ourselves from evil. It was ripe to be groomed by Nietzsche-ites.","Ryan and Facebook both represent license redefined as liberty. This is not the way the Framers of the Constitution saw things. They created a system of “ordered liberty,” rights constrained by obligations and responsibilities. Nothing in the Constitution is absolute, not the President’s power, not even freedom of speech. No one is above the law, as Richard Nixon learned. Don’t shout fire in a crowded theater, as Oliver Wendell Holmes observed.","Data is speech, and speech is data. Data is speech condensed into a tool. A tool is also a weapon. Enormous databases, like those created by Facebook, are weapons with tremendous throw weight. This is the lesson of our time.","Google has figured this out. It backed away from Google Plus. It never monetized Google News. It recently “redesigned” Google Finance to render it useless as an analysis tool. It has instead sought to become a products company, using the advantages it derived from the free Android and Chromebook operating systems to compete with Amazon in artificial intelligence.","Why would Google “tap a horde,” going into a market battle where it’s the decided underdog, when it has a virtual monopoly in search, and when 90% of its revenue comes from advertising alongside search results?","Maybe it got a clue.","As Facebook sinks, Google is throwing them an anchor. It’s called Google Subscribe. The company says this is designed to fight “fake news.” What it’s really designed to do is to get news outlets paid, and to get Google out of the news business.","By its nature Google Subscribe favors incumbents, the same companies that screwed the pooch on the Web in the first place. Worse, right now it limits how much content individuals can buy, by forcing them to buy “subscriptions.” It’s not a newsstand, it’s a collection of blow-in cards. If you want to read a newspaper, you shouldn’t have to buy a subscription, you should be able to buy today’s paper. A Google executive told me that a “day rate” should come, that the first version of the tool was designed to do what publishers said they wanted. Google should tell them what they need instead and direct them toward what the web needs. Publishers be stupid.","What Google is trying to do is precisely what it did, successfully, with e-mail a decade ago. You may remember that when the Web was spun we all rushed out to get our own e-mail addresses. But when e-mail became polluted, with spam and other garbage, Google put spam filters on the front of its free e-mail service.","This worked.","There were many e-mail filter programs offered during the last decade. I had one. But they were quickly overwhelmed. There were also many, many blacklists, and e-mail still had to be filtered manually, at the client. The “Pop3” system simply disappeared, and with it a lot of small hosting ISPs. Google took over e-mail, and a big hunk of the hosting market.","The idea here is similar, only for news content. Google proposes to control the market and let others take the risk of content, acting only as the banker. It is operating as the incumbent publishers who worked with it on this want it to.","The result will destroy the Web as we have known it. People may buy a subscription to The Washington Post, and a subscription to their local newspaper. But even people with money aren’t going to subscribe to many out of town papers, or to that many magazines. Google is picking winners in the news business, and it will be those who share their data with Google.","We can see this by looking inside the Google offer. It will push subscriptions to those with a “propensity to subscribe.” It will offer “teaser rates” but we all know these are strictly limited by time. Google is using its data on your behavior to help papers push subscriptions at you.","It’s clear, by now, that you can’t build content supported by Google ads. How many entrepreneurs are going to be able to compete in the era of Google subscriptions? Damned few. And only those who are willing to be tied, hip and thigh, to Google the way they’re now tied to Gmail e-mail addresses. Don’t be evil, indeed. There’s now a barrier to online competition, and that’s now how the Web should work.","But let’s not be cynical. What Google is proposing to do is a first step toward ordering the media liberty the Web offers. Most of what must happen will happen within the market, because the Internet remains a global resource.","The Web made it possible to separate the delivery of information from its value, and we have been running with it for 20 years.

The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.","Related Coverage","The recovery in Facebook’s stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company’s relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.","The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.","If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.","ALL APOLOGIES","Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company’s privacy practices.","The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.","The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.","“Facebook’s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,” said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.","Slideshow (3 Images)","In Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is “absolutely certain” that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.","Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers’ access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.","“The was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time,” Zuckerberg said in the ads. “We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”","‘FUTURE REGULATION’","His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany’s justice minister said Facebook’s promises were not enough.","“In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,” Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.","Advertisers and users are also unhappy.","U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet’s YouTube for one week.","Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.","Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.","Reporting by David Shepardson; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Susan Thomas"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

By booting the companies from its platform \"pending further information,\" Facebook will no longer allow them to buy ads or manage their pages.","\"Protecting people's information is at the heart of what we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook,\"Grewel said, noting that Facebook had received recent reports of certain rules violations.","According to Grewal's statement, a University of Cambridge professor who had developed a personality prediction app for Facebook users called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" improperly passed user information to other parties, including Cambridge Analytica and SCL in 2015. Facebook allows some apps to get access to a user's profile and important data that identifies the user's preferences and interests.","Facebook said the professor, Cambridge Analytica, and the other parties involved agreed to destroy all the data at the time. But, Grewel said on Friday, \"several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.","Such information, if misused, can potentially help bad actors target Facebook users with ads and other information. This was apparently the case during the 2016 US presidential election. Trump's campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June that year to help target ads using voter data gathered from millions of adults in the US.","Several news outlets reported in 2016 that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5 million for its services in September alone that year, a significant increase from the $250,000 it paid one month earlier.","The matter of those emails and an FBI investigation surrounding Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state had hamstrung the Clinton campaign, and was seen as one part of a broader effort by Russian operatives to influence the US election.","It also raised questions about whether Trump associates had cooperated with Russia's election-meddling activity, because Russian operatives capitalized on detailed user data to deliver targeted ads and content on Facebook and other social-media platforms.","Worries about whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin arose in part because the content touted by Russian state actors was highly specific, and targeted to competitive US voter precincts — details that some experts have said would not have been familiar to a foreign entity.","The Trump campaign has sought to distance itself from Cambridge Analytica, and has denied any wrongdoing.","In an email to Business Insider, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said the company \"fully complies with Facebook's terms of service\" and said it is working with Facebook to resolve the matter.","Read Cambridge Analytica's full statement below:","\"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook's terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.","Cambridge Analytica's Commercial and Political divisions use social media platforms for outward marketing, delivering data-led and creative content to targeted audiences. They do not use or hold data from Facebook profiles.","In 2014, we contracted a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally-renowned institution to undertake a large scale research project in the United States.","This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR was also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. GSR obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook.","When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR.","We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.","Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations.\"","We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook. Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.","We Maintain Strict Standards and Policies","Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\" Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","Breaking the Rules Leads to Suspension","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.","How Things Have Changed","We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers. Now all apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process, which requires developers to justify the data they're looking to collect and how they're going to use it - before they're allowed to even ask people for it.","In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list. This is just one of the many ways we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can manage or revoke those permissions at any time.","On an ongoing basis, we also do a variety of manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with our policies and a positive experience for users. These include steps such as random audits of existing apps along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing apps.","We enforce our policies in a variety of ways — from working with developers to fix the problem, to suspending developers from our platform, to pursuing litigation.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-16"}

(http://reut.rs/2pn8btD)","The scrutiny presents a fresh threat to Facebook's reputation, which is already under attack over Russia's alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","Facebook said on Monday it had hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to carry out a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica, which had agreed to comply and give the forensics firm complete access to their servers and systems.","Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denies the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","But further allegations about the firm's tactics piled up on Monday, as Channel 4 News, a British broadcaster, published video of Cambridge Analytica executives talking about using bribes, former spies and Ukrainian sex workers to entrap politicians.","Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from U.S. Congress and questions about personal data safeguards after reports in the New York Times and London's Observer over the weekend.","On Monday, Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties.","Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.","Facebook and rivals including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled.","It was not clear whether Republicans who hold congressional committee gavels would announce hearings related to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. But the lawmaker comments reflected mounting bipartisan concern in Washington over whether internet firms are fair trustees of the massive amounts of user data they collect.","Some technology lobbyists have begun to quietly acknowledge the era of a hands-off approach to Silicon Valley from U.S. policymakers may be fading.","On Monday, the Senate was expected to move forward with a bill that would chip away at the internet industry’s legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking.

{"originalurl":"https://anith.com/facebook-data-misuse-scandal-affects-substantially-more-than-50m-claims-wylie-techcrunch/","title":"Facebook data misuse scandal affects “substantially” more than 50M, claims Wylie – TechCrunch – ANITH","text":["Chris Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower whose revelations about Facebook data being misused for political campaigning has wiped billions off the share price of the company in recent days and led to the FTC opening a fresh investigation, has suggested the scale of the data leak is substantially larger than has been reported so far.","Giving evidence today, to a UK parliamentary select committee that’s investigating the use of disinformation in political campaigning, Wylie said: “The 50 million number is what the media has felt safest to report — because of the documentation that they can rely on — but my recollection is that it was substantially higher than that. So my own view is it was much more than 50M.”","We’ve reached out to Facebook about Wylie’s claim — but at the time of writing the company had not provided a response.","“There were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,” Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says users’ data was obtained by CA. “It first started as a very small pilot — firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral register… We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallife deployed via Facebook’s platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014.","“That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.”","The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie.","“This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.”","Facebook has previously confirmed 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it.","Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing.","Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reported that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform.","In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak.","It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes. EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that.","“There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.”","Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, Facebook settled with the FTC over charges it had deceived users by “telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public”.","And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal.","Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.","When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data.","The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data”. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it has also tweeted re: the GSR data.","Asked by the committee about Nix’s earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”.","“That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data.","Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered.","Kogan also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”.","Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it sought to predict via patterns in the data.","He said:","For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC. And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like.","“That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.”","Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later.","“The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data”","Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms.","Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.”","The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions.","“That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Wylie added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.”","Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.”","The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns.","Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used.","“Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.”","In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: “The source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property.”","Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA.","“It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore.","“But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].”","The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”.","During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform.","“He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted?","“It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.”","We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either.","Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge.

We expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all the organisations involved to cooperate fully.”","It comes a day after Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, accused Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive of making “false statements” to MPs.","Alexander Nix “deliberately misled the committee and Parliament” by denying his company had received data from the Global Science Research (GSR) company, Mr Collins said in a statement, referencing reports in The Observer that tens of millions of Facebook users’ data had been captured by GSR in a deal with Cambridge Analytica.","But Cambridge Analytica denied Mr Nix’s testimony was misleading, saying it “strongly refutes that reporting because it is wrong”.","A spokesperson told The Independent: “Alexander Nix did not mislead the committee. He told the committee that Cambridge Analytica had received data from GSR in relation to a research project that they undertook on our behalf in 2014.","“He went on to say that Cambridge Analytica does not hold or use any data received from GSR.

(Representational Image/ Pixabay)","New York: Facebook ‘likes’ can tell a lot about a person. Maybe even enough to fuel a voter-manipulation effort like the one a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm stands accused of -- and which Facebook may have enabled.","The social network is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections.","Officials in the EU and the US sought answers, while Britain’s information commissioner said she will seek a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica’s servers because the British firm had been ‘uncooperative’ in her investigation.","The first casualty of that investigation was an audit of Cambridge that Facebook had announced earlier in the day; the company said it ‘stood down’ that effort at the request of British officials.","Adding to the turmoil, the New York Times reported that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will step down by August following clashes over how aggressively Facebook should address its role in spreading disinformation.","In a tweet, Stamos said he’s still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed. It would have been quieter had Facebook likes not turned out to be so revealing.","Researchers in a 2013 study found that likes on hobbies, interests and other attributes can predict personal attributes such as sexual orientation and political affiliation. Computers analyze such data to look for patterns that might not be obvious, such as a link between a preference for curly fries and higher intelligence.","Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, said the firm used such techniques to learn about individuals and create an information cocoon to change their perceptions.","In doing so, he said, the firm ‘took fake news to the next level’. “This is based on an idea called ‘informational dominance,’ which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what’s actually happening,” Wylie said Monday on NBC’s ‘Today’. It’s not yet clear exactly how the firm might have attempted to do that.","Those people agreed to share data with the app for research — not for political targeting.","And the data included who their Facebook friends were and what they liked — even though those friends hadn’t downloaded the app or given explicit consent. Cambridge got limited information on the friends, but machines can use detailed answers from smaller groups to make good inferences on the rest, said Kenneth Sanford of the data science company Dataiku.","Cambridge was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, and at one point employed Stephen Bannon -- later President Donald Trump’s campaign chairman and White House adviser -- as a vice president.","The Trump campaign paid Cambridge roughly USD 6 million according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work.","The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common, but is typically used to sell diapers and other products.","Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person’s viewing behaviours fit with what other customers watch.","But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it’s connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media. Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to ‘explore mental vulnerabilities of people.’ He said the firm “works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.”","Wylie told ‘Today’ that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge effort aimed to make sure people wouldn’t know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.","The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge’s data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing, and says it didn’t retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn’t use it in its 2016 campaign work.","Yet Cambridge boasted of its work after another client, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, won the Iowa caucus in 2016.","Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz from similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use.","Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages.","For voters who care about tradition, it could push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might have described keeping guns for protection against crime.","It’s possible that Cambridge tapped other data sources, including what Cruz’s campaign app collected. Nix said during the Cruz campaign that it had five or six sources of data on each voter.","Facebook declined to provide officials for interview and didn’t immediately respond to requests for information beyond its statements Friday and Monday.","Cambridge also didn’t immediately respond to emailed questions.","Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them.","Facebook’s mapping of the ‘social graph’ -- essentially the web of people’s real-life connections -- is also invaluable for marketers.","For example, researchers can look at people’s clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","People who bridge different friend networks, for example, can have more influence when they post something, making them prime for targeting.","Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according to Pew Research Center.","While people don’t exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the ‘rabbit hole’ of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

We need to better understand this problem so that we can challenge it.","Over the weekend, allegations emerged surrounding the use of\nFacebook\nuser data by a data analytics firm called Cambridge Analytica. But while they\nhave allegedly broken Facebook’s rules, the real problem is Facebook’s business\nmodel. And it’s a model that isn't unique to Facebook. It originated with Google, which\nrealised that the data gathered as people used its search engine could be analysed\nto predict what they wanted and deliver targeted advertising, and it’s also employed\nby most ‘free’ online services.","This isn't just a problem with Facebook. It's a problem with\nthe internet as it exists today.","‘Surveillance capitalism’ was the term coined in 2015 by\nHarvard academic Shoshanna Zuboff to describe this large-scale surveillance and\nmodification of human behaviour for profit. It involves predictive analysis of\nbig datasets describing the lives and behaviours of tens or hundreds of\nmillions of people, allowing correlations and patterns to be identified,\ninformation about individuals inferred, and future behaviour to be predicted. Attempts\nare then made to influence this behaviour through personalised and dynamic targeted\nadvertising. This is refined by testing numerous variations of adverts on\ndifferent demographics to see what works best. Every time you use the internet\nyou are likely the unwitting subject of dozens of experiments trying to figure\nout how to most effectively extract money from you.","Surveillance capitalism monetises our lives for their\nprofit, turning everything that we do into data points to be packaged together as\na profile describing us in great detail. Access to that data profile is sold on\nthe advertising market. But it isn’t just access to our data profile that is\nbeing sold – it’s access to the powerful behavioural modification tools developed\nby these corporations, to their knowledge about our psychological\nvulnerabilities, honed through experimentation over many years. In effect,\nthrough their pervasive surveillance apparatus they build up intricate\nknowledge of the daily lives and behaviours of hundreds of millions of people\nand then charge other companies to use this knowledge against us for their\nbenefit.","And, as increasing numbers of people are realising,\nsurveillance capitalism doesn't just benefit corporations. It benefits\npolitical organisations as well – shadowy ones like Cambridge Analytica, yes,\nbut also the mainstream political parties and candidates. The Obama campaign of\n2008 is often described as the first ‘big data’ campaign, but it was in 2012\nthat his team truly innovated. The Obama\nteam’s operations were sophisticated enough that they were able to target\nvoters that the Romney campaign, by their own admission, didn’t even know\nexisted. Their use of analytics-driven microtargeting allowed them to run a\nhighly effective digital campaign and set an example which has been followed repeatedly\nsince.","if twentieth\ncentury campaigns had magnifying glasses and baseball bats, those of the twenty–first century have\ntelescopes, microscopes and\nscalpels","Today, tools like Facebook’s\nCustom Audiences and Lookalike Audiences, which allow advertisers –\nincluding political organisations – to upload lists of people, match them with\ntheir Facebook profile, filter in the profiles of similar people who aren’t on\ntheir list, and target them all, mean that political campaigns can greatly\nextend the reach of their carefully-crafted messaging.","As Zeynep Tufekci, a\nprofessor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, says, if twentieth\ncentury political targeted campaigns had magnifying glasses and baseball bats, those of the twenty–first century have\nacquiredtelescopes, microscopes and\nscalpels in the shape of algorithms and analytics. Campaigns can deliver\ndifferent arguments to different groups of voters, so no two people may ever see\nthe same set of adverts or arguments. This takes political campaigning from\nbeing a public process to being a private, personalised affair, helped along by\naccess to the apparatus of surveillance capitalism.","Facebook has conducted its own research on the effectiveness\nof targeted political messaging using its platform. In the 2010 US midterms it found\nthat it was able to increase a user’s likelihood of voting by around 0.4% per\ncent by telling them that their friends had voted and encouraging them to do\nthe same. It repeated the experiment in 2012 with similar results. That might\nnot sound like much, but on a national scale it translates to around 340,000\nextra votes. George Bush won the 2000 election by a few hundred votes in\nFlorida. Donald Trump won in part because he managed to gain 100,000 key votes\nin the rust belt.","And in countries like the UK, where elections are often\ndecided by relatively few marginal constituencies in which political parties\nfocus their efforts, small numbers matter – one study of last year’s election\nsuggest that the Conservative\nParty was just 401 votes short of an overall majority. Accordingly, in 2013\nthe Conservatives\nhired Obama’s 2012 campaign manager, and both the Vote Leave campaign and\nthe Labour Party have boasted about their data operations. The Information\nCommissioner’s Office, which oversees data protection and privacy regulation in\nthe UK, is investigating the use of these practices here. The new EU General\nData Protection Regulation, when it comes into force in May, promises to\nprovide something of a brake.","the Government is exploring an agreement with the US that would give British intelligence agencies better access to these databases.","But there's also a third group who benefits from the troves\nof data that surveillance capitalism corporations have gathered about the\nminutiae of the daily lives of billions of people – the state. The Snowden\nrevelations in 2013 about GCHQ and the NSA’s activities made headlines\naround the world. Much of the focus was on programmes which involved, among\nother things, weakening encryption standards, installing backdoors in otherwise\nsecure networking equipment, and placing interceptors on internet backbone\ncables so as to siphon off the data passing through. These programmes rake in\nbillions of records every day, with GCHQ’s stated aim being to compile a profile\nof the internet habits of every user on the web.","These are concerning surveillance practices that raise\ndifficult questions about the relationship between the citizen and the state. And\nsince 2013 these questions have been articulated by many – not least by the\nECJ, which ruled in\n2016 that indiscriminate communications data retention is incompatible with a\nfree and democratic society. This led to the Government's recent\nconsultation on revisions to the parts of the Investigatory Powers Act that\nallow the Government to require ISPs to retain records of the browsing history\nof every user in the UK and provide them to security and intelligence agencies,\npolice, and a range of other public authorities upon request and without a\nwarrant or other direct judicial oversight. A challenge brought by Privacy\nInternational to the bulk personal dataset powers contained in the Investigatory\nPowers Act was referred to the ECJ in September.","This is\nhow the internet of today has been built. Not for us – for them.","Surveillance capitalism – with smartphones, laptops, and the\nincreasing numbers of ‘internet of things’ devices making up its physical\ninfrastructure, watching and tracking everything we do, and the public as\nwilling participants – increases the capacity of corporations, political\norganisations, and the state to track, influence, and control populations at scale.\nThis is of benefit to those corporations, political organisations, and state\nagencies economically, politically, and in pursuit of the increasingly nebulous\ndemands of ‘security’. This is how the internet of today has been built. Not\nfor us – for them. This is the future that we've sleepwalked into. We need to\nlook beyond Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. It’s time for a wider debate\nabout the role of surveillance in our increasingly digital society.","About the author","Jennifer Cobbe is the co-ordinator of Cambridge University's Trustworthy Technologies strategic research initiative, which researches trust, computer and internet technologies.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Pressed by the committee chairman at the Commons liaison committee later in the day, the prime minister said “Mr Zuckerberg will decide for himself” whether to give evidence to parliament.","She said the Cambridge Analytica affair “raises very deep concern in terms of what is suggested” and repeatedly said it was for Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and any individuals involved to “cooperate fully” with the information commissioner.","The company’s head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, said in a letter to Collins: “Facebook fully recognises the level of public and parliamentary interest in these issues and support your belief that these issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position to answer your questions. As such, Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available.”","Both men, Stimson wrote, “report directly to Mr Zuckerberg and are among the longest-serving senior representatives in Facebook’s 15-year history. Both of them have extensive expertise in these issues and are well placed to answer the committee’s questions on these complex subjects.”","During Tuesday’s committee hearing, Wylie suggested Facebook may have been aware of the large-scale harvesting of data carried out by Cambridge Analytica’s partner GSR even earlier than had been previously reported.","“I remember, and I think this was in around July 2014, [Aleksandr Kogan, GSR’s founder] was delayed for a couple of days because Facebook had throttled the app so that it couldn’t pull as much data, or there was some problem with pulling the data at the same speed as before.","“He told me he had had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook. So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers, or at least that’s what he told me.”","It took until 2015 for Facebook to take action on the data-harvesting project, after a Guardian article detailing GSR’s data abuse in support of the Ted Cruz campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.","And it was not until last week, after Facebook had again been notified by the Observer about the harvesting, that the company released a statement noting that “the entire company is outraged that we were deceived”.","Wylie also claimed that Palantir, a national security contractor owned by the Facebook board member Peter Thiel, was allowed informal access to the Facebook data harvested by GSR.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir,” Wylie said. “There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data. That was not an official contract between Palantir and CA, but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data. And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.”","Despite the confidentiality agreements he entered into with Cambridge Analytica, Wylie described Facebook’s attempts to kill last week’s story as being the most forceful.","“The most amount of legal pushback that I’ve got actually wasn’t from Cambridge Analytica, it was from Facebook. It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he said.","“They sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t taken action on that. I think, I’m not sure exactly what they’re planning to do. They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me any more.”","Testifying alongside Wylie was Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of personaldata.io, who has been fighting to force the social network to apply European data protection law. Dehaye revealed that Facebook repeatedly tried to argue it was exempt from fulfilling “subject access” requirements, which allow individuals to see the data that companies hold about them, because it would be too expensive to comply.","“They’re invoking exceptions … involving disproportionate effort,” Dehaye said. “They’re saying it’s too much effort to give me access to my data. I find that quite intriguing, because they’re making a technical and a business argument as to why I shouldn’t have access to this data.","“In the technical argument they’re shooting themselves in the foot, because they’re saying they’re so big the cost would be too large to provide me data.”","In effect, Dehaye said, Facebook told him it was too big to regulate. “They’re really arguing that they’re too big to comply with data protection law, the cost is too high, which is mind-boggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make this argument?”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

You already live in a bubble by your own choice.","Facebook showing you only news that you are likely to already agree with is no different. It just makes it more convenient. People truly affected by this would have scrolled past news they disagree with anyway and regarded them as fake/inaccurate.","And to an extent, that’s not too different from what google does. Where the top results are what you are likely to click on, based on the profile google has built with your data.","The only way around this is to actively seek news from all over and using tools that don’t track your data.","The problem, in my view, is that Facebook is now something more sinister than in the beginning. Everyone originally joined Facebook as a way of communicating with friends. Remember back in the day when it was just status updates from your friends*? Then your parents started joining and your grandparents. Then we could post websites and videos (and so did your racist uncle). Then there was money to be made by posting that crap. Then there’s political advantage for posting lies.","Then we'd also be free from the stuff commercials pay for. I don't know about you, but a lot of people would be upset if YouTube, Google, and Facebook were subscription services that had to be paid for upfront.","Maybe the difference, and I'm just spitballing here, is that any old traditional advertising tries to manipulate us by known rather low-grade common denominators. Which is at best abstract and removed from the individual. But with more and more data and especially data that is gathered without consent (well, arguably naive, not very informed consent) to target specific individuals, the equation changes? Exacerbated perhaps by the surprise (again naive) that \"advances\" in advertising aren't limited to the commerical sphere.","The value of personal information now that advertising has evolved with technology is here to stay. The \"Big Brother\" the author warns of is really just anyone seeking profit. People have volunteered their \"freedom\" (I disagree with the term's use in the title and article) in exchange for not having to pay for a service that seems nearly vital to them.","Social media is not going anywhere, no matter how many scandals there are or litigation. In the 24 hour news cycle people tend to have the attention span of a goldfish, and frankly it's difficult not to.","The big question is going to be what the evolved business model for social networking is going to look like. Facebook and Google can't exist in their current form/capacity without targeted ads unless users want to pay for the service directly. Humans love free shit, especially if they can ignore it's actual cost 99% of the time, then be outraged at the 1% of the time a scandal hits the news.","This article seems to dig very deep despite a very visible issue. Massive social media platforms are very expensive. Even actual successes like Twitter are for the most part unprofitable (I believe something like >95% of their quarterly reports are losses). Consumers (who are currently products) need to decide if they will pay for these services as they are by trading their information for use, or if they will pay directly via some sort of a subscription model.","The option to surrender personal information in an almost subconscious manner is completely voluntary. I fail to agree that it compromises our freedom both in the definition of freedom but more-so in the public's willingness to give up this information in exchange for use of the platform. The option to simply not use it, or at the least only use it for basic things is completely feasible.","When treating adults as adults, with the chance to opt-out with no cost at any point in time ever, is considered \"unconscionable\", I feel like even discussing ethics is moot. Ethics afterall is based on decisions. If people are too stupid to make their own decisions ethics boils down to who should be our dictator.","You're right about Facebook not being obligatory. Everyone is obviously at liberty to stop using it at any time.","That said, the fact that Facebook is optional does not suddenly mean it is permissible for them to put anything they want into their TOS. It would be unconscionable for them to e.g. require every user to give them rights to sell their likeness to be used as involuntary pornography. It would be unconscionable for Facebook to sell or share information about political exiles with the death squads that hunt them. Despite the fact that Facebook is a trivial diversion, there are still legal and moral limits to the kinds of relationships that Facebook can even attempt to engage in with its users. This is a fact.","Americans like to make a real fetish out of the sanctity of the contract, as though nobody has ever had a gun held to their head, as though coercion and duress are fictions.","As a facebook user, I don't mind. Mark Z. If you are reading this, I really honestly don't mind you taking that information. It's valuable to you but to me it's not valuable so please don't sweat it. This whole Facebook drama will blow over.","Knowing I am constantly surveilled by government and industry is oppressive and stifling. I wanted to buy a pressure cooker online right after the Boston marathon bombing. I waited for weeks in hopes to not attract anyone who might think I was going to be a copycat bomber. I just purchased online materials to make fertilizer wondering if I would be questioned as to my intention for these items. I expressed my opinion on the politics sub with a metaphor the moderators could not comprehend and was banned due to their ignorance. I came of age long before social media and felt much more free when it was only financial and legal oppression I suffered under. Now I feel like I live in an absolute police state. Knowing I am spied on all the time makes me feel like I am going to be fleeced, chastised or punished at any moment. I am convinced this has deeply negative effects on social interaction, commerce and politics. This constant pressure and annoyance is making people crack and disengage. A perfect vehicle for absolute corruption for those in power. I hope the population gets wise before ignorance is prevalent.","Exactly, everything on my Facebook (and all social media for that matter) advised that Trump was a racist monster I vote against. I’m an extreme conservative so it should follow that Facebook only shows me what I agree with, but I rarely saw news praising conservative movements, and the ones I did find were rubbish garbage.","I agree. They should be required to make a friendly videos with nice music about what they do with our information like they do when they want to teach you about a new site feature. Like a \"this is how it works, how we make our money\" series.","What reason does facebook have to be this scrupulous provider of social interaction that you expect it to be? People willingly give their data to a company. Nobody is required to do this in any form. I dont understand where is the \"abuse\". Its like writing down your phone number in public toilets and then being outraged about weirdos calling you at night.","I agree with you Travis, I do not understand why people cannot wrap their minds around the fact Facebook is nothing more than a company with shareholders. Perhaps someone could explain why people believe it's some sort of core human endeavor ment to benefit the whole of society by making it easy to share family photos.","You can't say that our internet isn't under attack by companies wanting to sell our data for big bucks, and the recent cloud law that was passed allows the U.S. Government (and other countries) to use all of it while providing the companies with gag orders about the data being used, completely with no oversight.","All you're saying is that it's our own fault for being scammed because no one bothered to read \"the small print\" (which is only included to keep their ass from being sued), and that's straight victim-blaming.","The FTC is talking about fining Facebook $60k per each of fifty million infractions. Facebook has a lot of money, but it doesn't have that much money, especially after it's shares took a twenty percent hit. And then the EU is rolling out a new social media policy in the next couple months with draconian penalties. Now is not a good time for Zuckerberg to go on vacation. If he does, there might not be a Facebook when he gets back.","Which EU policy are you talking about? Yeah FTC is talking about but lets wait and see. Pretty sure they won't shoot at an US company that important because of the data they have. I bet there won't be any serious consequences in the USA. In the EU they'll have to pay a few billion panelties and that's it.","Read the posted content, understand and identify the philosophical arguments given, and respond to these substantively.

Facebook exists because of ads and selling your data... personal data you voluntarily gave it.","Remember when Equifax lost everyone's info? Or when Target was hacked? Or when it came out that the NSA was gathering data? The Facebook news is a drop in the bucket. Everyone needs to settle down and go work on their hobby.","it seems obvious to me that big data leads to the ability to wrangle, subjugate, or cordon off people.","In fact I think \"captain obvious\" statements like this is why philosophy is seen as antiquated in general: if you collect tons of data about people and custom serve content based on that data, you are reducing the randomness of their experience. Look at google locality bubbles, ad network ads, and facebook timeline content comparisons.","This is obvious if you read a \"dummies guide\" to big data methodologies.","Someone (even as illustrious as this author) coming along claiming privacy issues understate the freedom issues over a decade into the discourse about big data is simply late to the party.","There is overwhelming evidence that an election's outcome was completely swayed by the power of this big data to target individuals, so, yeah. not understated.","A little disappointed that all the comments immediately gravitate to the topic of Facebook and the news.

So the company has built its own distributed networking system to support its growing data needs – and to lay the groundwork for even larger cloud campuses to come.","At Tuesday’s Open Compute Summit 2018, Facebook unveiled the Fabric Aggregator, a new system to manage data traffic between its data centers. The company is donating the device design to the Open Compute Project (OCP), the open source hardware project which Facebook co-founded in 2011.","The development of Fabric Aggregator highlights how the super-sizing of data centers and cloud campuses has implications for network equipment. As hyperscale companies like Facebook continue to grow, the huge volumes of user data prompt them to add data centers. This leads to larger cloud campuses, with truly massive volumes of data moving between them.","The volume of this “East-West” traffic between data centers far surpasses the volume of data traveling to other campuses and the Internet – known as “North-South” traffic.","Even Bigger Campuses Ahead?","As we noted yesterday, Facebook has been increasing the scale of its data center campuses. Since the beginning of 2017, Facebook has announced five new cloud campuses, and now has 12 around the globe, including nine in the U.S.","Early campuses featured two data centers, but the company has recently been building bigger.","“We’ve been moving to six buildings, creating a large increase in East-West traffic,” said Sree Sankar, Technical Product Manager at Facebook. “That required a big change.”","Facebook’s Sree Sankar describe’s how Fabric Aggregator manages traffic between data centers during a presentation at the Open Compute Summit Tuesday in San Jose, Calif. (Photo: Rich Miller)","The Fabric Aggregator is a distributed network system made up of a simple building block – Facebook’s Wedge 100 switch.","“Unfortunately using a large, general purpose network chassis no longer met our needs in terms of scale, power efficiency, and flexibility,” the Facebook Engineering Team said in a blog post. “Taking a disaggregated approach allows us to accommodate larger regions and varied traffic patterns, while providing the flexibility to adapt to future growth.”","What does “adapt to future growth” mean? One obvious possibility is even larger data center campuses, with more buildings. But the most important benefit of the new architecture is that Fabric Aggregator provides flexibility, allowing it to manage campuses with different numbers of facilities in a logical fashion.","Free Resource from Data Center Frontier White Paper Library","After looking at the specifics around LIB and lead-acid energy storage alternatives, we can see the future looks promising for lithium ion batteries. They are designed to bring extended life, reduced weight, smaller size and greater flexibility to modern data center providers. For more information on Lithium Ion Battery solutions for UPS applications, please download this white paper.","Flexible Enough for Many Scenarios","The aggregator was designed so it can work within a single rack, or in a multi-rack configurations. Different flavors of the rack were designed to support various networking technologies that tie together the many layers of data center traffic.","“The ability to tailor different Fabric Aggregator node sizes in different regions allows us to use resources more efficiently, while having no internal dependencies keeps failures isolated, improving the overall reliability of the system,” Facebook said.","The Fabric Aggregator uses Wedge100S switches with Facebook Open Switching System (FBOSS) as the base building blocks, running Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) between all subswitches","“A building block approach gives us the ability to operate the solution at either the subswitch or node level,” the Facebook team writes. “For example, if we detect a misbehaving subswitch inside a particular node, we can take that specific subswitch out of service for debugging. If there is a need take all downstream and upstream subswitches out of service in a node, our operational tools abstract all the underlying complexities inherent to multiple interactions across many individual subswitches. We also implement redundancy at the node level so that we can take many nodes out of service simultaneously in a single region. The Fabric Aggregator layer can suffer many simultaneous failures without compromising the overall performance of the network.”","Stay informed: Get our news updates!","About Rich Miller","I write about the places where the Internet lives, telling the story of data centers and the people who build them.

If they did, what is clear, Utah has little clue of how DC politics & Judicial Councils work when it comes to protecting their own & the Judicial Council reputation of producing Justices for the Supreme Court of the United States. Roberts was one of those, a golden child, unblemished, it was made to appear as Richard Warren Roberts left Utah. Enroute to Utah, Richard Roberts was an African American D.O.J. lawyer sent to argue civil rights for the U.S.G. vs the serial shooter who shot Vernon Jordan, Hustler's Larry Flynt amongst others including 4 teenagers- 2 African American youth, their girlfriends the shooter thought were white. Terry Richard is bi-racial. More important, Terry's 1981 testimony sealed the shooter's fate- executed 2013.","Terry Mitchell serves a life sentence. 27 year old USG lawyer Richard Roberts raped 16 year old Terry every night. Lawyer Roberts said Roberts was reviewing testimony with the teen holding off sex until Terry testified. Utah based DOJ lawyer Snarr said Roberts took the 2 teen girl witnesses. Snarr said Snarr had no idea of Roberts nightly 'testimony' meetings with state witness Terry Mitchell.","Decades later, former DC Chief Judge Richard Roberts insists 27 year old Roberts was in a relationship with the teenager. Witnesses histories are disclosed to state attorneys. Roberts was aware star state witness Terry Mitchell was raped 6 months prior to being shot, that Terry had been sexually abused since she was a toddler. Terry was impressionable moreso to the DC superstar that came from the big city to make bad things better. Instead, lawyer Roberts did to Terry what men did before. Lawyer Richard Roberts took trophy photos of Terry before leaving back to DC from Utah. The clothed photos of Terry, Richard Roberts gave to Terry. The naked photos of Terry, US attorney Richard Roberts kept, most likely to this day. Roberts kept telephoning Terry- daily, monthly, yearly, tracking Terry through people she knew een 2013 emailing Terry from the Roberts District Court chambers.","There was a quandry what to do with Roberts. There was concensus Roberts did wrong. Concensus looked at disciplinary actions the to take, not what laws Roberts broke like child pornography, interstate, stalking....","Bar associations are self regulatory organizations. Bar associations are not law enforcement. Bar associations do not turn child rapist dues paying business league members over to cops.","Roberts withholding Roberts was having sex with the state witness Terry Mitchell prejudiced the case against the shooter Klansman Jackson. Roberts covering up from defense counsel Roberts was having sex with state's witness could have been used to impeach Mitchell's testimony, rightly or wrongly","4 years after the Utah civil rights trial, when state prosecutors move forward and away from their state witnesses, shining star lawyer Richard Roberts was tracking Roberts rape victim down, making calls, telling people lawyer Roberts was hunting his rape victim down.","1998, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton nominated civil rights lawyer Richard Roberts to President Clinton, to be a DC District Court Judge. Roberts was riding high on his Utah civil rights trial success. Holmes Norton did not adress Roberts breach of lawyers ethics raping a state witness during a trial.","There seem to be no disagreement what Ricahrd Roberts did was wrong. Bizarrely, no one it seemed was getting 'the what to do' right. Roberts was above the law, it seemed.","Lawyers & Judges prefer to not eat their own. Judges are lawyers too bound by the same ethics and preference to look the other way when bad things are done.","Small world that it is, Mueller associates Loretta Lynch & current DC Chief Judge Howell worked together as young prosecutors in Brooklyn, NY. Some share the opinion Judge Howell should step aside when it comes to conflicts of interests in DC Courts. DC Judicial Council does not step aside it seems. DC Judicial Councils protect their ownwith the same 'disturbing silence' that Vatican covered up sex abuse claims with, the same 'disturbring silence' the olympic gymnastic camps covered up for decades, the same 'disturbring silence' #metoo took down Hollywood with, except done Judge style, no one gets taken down unless partisan politics is involved including SCOTUS nominees from the District Court Judicial Council named in Memorandums the Judicial Court headed by current Chief Judge Howell is involved.","Judges dont eat their own knowing 'their' turn at peer review could be next.","2 unaffiliated & separated victims fought back, against DC former Chief Judge Richard Roberts, filing Judicial Disability complaints and Judicial Misconduct complaints. Current Chief Judge Howell and former SCOTUS nominee Merrick Garland both sit on the DC Judicial Council. Both Howell and Garland led others including SCOTUS nominee in to denying the Judicial complaints, received by the DC Court 2014 and since, 2016 and still.","USG employee Richard Roberts used government funds to pay for the room in which Roberts raped teenager Terry Mitchells, in which Roberts took nude shots of the teenager, contacting his victim from Judge chambers 2+ decades later. The DC & 10th Circuit Judicial Councils saw no issue with misues of government funds and use of government funds for a crime.","The DC & 10th Circuit Judicial Councils saw no issue with lawyer then Judge Richard Roberts lying on Robert's applications for employment in the Federal Judicial Branch & then again under oath to Senators Roberts testified to for Roberts nomination to the DC District Court as Judge then again Chief Judge.","Rocky Anderson, lawyer for Judge Roberts rape victim Terry Mitchell raised the point Judge Karen Henderson was 72 years old, above the approved age of doing her judicial duty. Judge Henderson's letter certifying Robert's permanent disability was turned in to President Obama 3-16-2016. The date is symbolic to Terry Mitchell Judge Roberts rape victim. Terry Mitchell said \"...I wanted the day 16. I was 16 when Roberts raped me over and over that week....\"","Judge Henderson certified to the President of the United States that Roberts was unable to perform his duties.","The 10th Circuit Judicial Counsel detailed in the 10th Circuit Memorandum 2 neurologists & 28 witnesses and staff testimony was Robert's was disabled 22 months before the day Roberts tendered Roberts resignation to President Obama. Roberts was also 58 years old 22 months prior, 2 years short of retiring at full pension of $203,000 a year for life. The Judicial Council said nothing. That is what Judicial Councils, even those party politicking President Trump, that is what Judicial Councilsdo after all Judges are lawyers and Judges and lawyers are people too. They all have their price, like the Vatican, like the Olympic medical community, like the Securities Broker-Dealer only DRS Dispute Resolution Forum FINRA do.... protect their own in their s.r.o. self-regulatory organization forum putting their Codes and Rules of Procedure ahead of the law.","The irony of President Trump's nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is sex and ethics. Kavanaughs memos on Clintons are prominent in the converstions media and politics are pouring through. No one is talking about looking at the Memorandums for Judicial Complaints Kavanaugh was party to in the DC District Court Judicial circle, for example, the Memorandums Kavanaugh participated in that dismissed victims complaints of Judicial Misconduct and Judicial disability especially the Memorandums that falsely certify the date and time of knowledge of a Judge's mental state disability onset and the Judicial Complaint dismissing filed by a Judge's rape victim focusing solely on timely filed, ignoring it ever happened and the Judge did not put the complain in the Judge's history in to the Federal employment application forms.","Media find it more salacious to focus on cigar tricks and Monica Lewinsky's vajajay rather than a teenager tormented for 35+ years with rape at the hands of the man the teenager trusted because the President of America Jimmy Careter told her she could.","Larry Flynt fought To keep Jackson from being executed. Flynt wanted Jackson alive suffering in prison the same way Jackson left Flynt imprisoned in a wheelchair paralyzed for life.","The 2nd round of cases filed in Utah by Judge Roberts rape victim was filed in 2016. Prior cases was filed in 2015 with ongoing noice made by Terry Mitchell since 2013 in and around when President Obama appointed Roberts to the DC District Court.","Both Judge Roberts and Huvelle were presiding over very important cases impacting the United States of America","President Jimmy Carter has remained silent on the topic of Carter's 1981 hand picked civil rights attorney's rape of a key witness in a civil rights case against the Klu Klux Klan. President Carter said nothing about the child inside the 50 year old Terry Mitchell searching for someone to trust, still.","Judge Howell","Disgraced Former DC Chief Judge Richard Roberts","Trump has discovered the impeachable moment of a District Court collective. District Court Judges are appointed & impeached at the will of the President. An activist Judicial Council against a President, his men and against victims harmed by a Council colluding to coverup Judicial disability to get Judge's paid when the Judges should be on disability is a reason why. And when the sitting Chief Judge is a foot soldier for Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy with conflicts with Mueller there is more to be said and done.","The DC Judicial Council delayed law enforcement investigations in to both Judge Ellen Huvelle and Judge Richard Roberts purporting to be official investigations with enforcement ability","9 Days after Utah Attorney General wrote to DC Circuit Judge Garland Merrick regarding Misconduct of Richard Roberts Garland Merrick stepped up taking the SCOTUS nomination Richard Roberts was yanked from","Legal Times published Judge Ellen Huvelle fell down stairs in Massachusetts breaking Huvelle's C5, C6, C& paralyzed able to move one toe only.

At the time I was working on the Guardian’s investigations desk, and I heard the company’s “election management” consultancy was branching out into US voter targeting with a curious new product and corporate identity. This, I would later discover, was Cambridge Analytica.","After that tip came a small cache of documents. And in December 2014, I wrote to SCL asking about its commercial relationship with a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan, and its apparent acquisition of a vast database of personal information harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users by Kogan’s company, Global Science Research (GSR). At this stage I didn’t know whose political campaign it was working on in the US. It seemed to have acquired the data, but how was it using it? I now regret putting the story on the back burner, but when SCL repeatedly refused to engage, that’s what happened. Back then, few had heard of this company.","Fast forward to autumn 2015 and a source pointed me in the direction of a Politico article that made a connection between SCL and Cambridge Analytica. By then it was offering psychological methods for targeting voters to the Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz. So I returned to my investigation and in December 2015 reported that SCL had paid GSR to harvest Facebook users’ data via online questionnaires. GSR boasted it owned “a massive data pool of 40+ million individuals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles.”","Last week, Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, was forced to acknowledge the privacy breach and apologise for the company’s mistakes, embarking on an uncharacteristic media blitz. Yet when I first asked Facebook about the way this data had been siphoned from the social network, the company had little to say. Apparently, it didn’t anticipate the significance the dataset would take on. But then nor did I.","Before we published that story in 2015, I had approached Facebook’s public relations representatives in London to inform them of the allegations. I asked them a series of questions, including: “Is Facebook concerned that highly personal data about a large set of its users is now being exploited for experimental political campaigning purposes?” They didn’t answer. After declining to comment on the record, they emailed a few lines on background: “Facebook has a clear data use policy that makes it clear how the information people choose to add to Facebook is used.” Their repetition of the word “clear” only made this feel more doubtful.","Hours after the story was published, Facebook’s PRs got in touch seeking more information, and later that evening I heard from the mothership itself when a senior, California-based employee emailed a statement. “We are carefully investigating this situation,” it read, “misleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do.” In time, we would come to understand just what Facebook – one of the world’s most powerful companies – meant by “swift action”.","In early 2016, I continued to investigate Cambridge Analytica, pursuing leads about its parent company, SCL, and talking to former employees and clients. I interviewed Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s then CEO and a director of SCL. He refused to say whether he was or wasn’t working in the UK on the leave campaign. (Little did I know SCL had deep ties to the digital firm AggregateIQ, as the Observer reported on Sunday, to which Vote Leave would funnel 40% of its spending.) “We’ve been talking to all sorts of political parties about different matters in the UK,” he told me. In the US, Nix said that “hundreds of thousands of people across America” had taken Cambridge Analytica’s online questionnaires, but claimed respondents’ Facebook accounts were not accessed. He was dismissive of the privacy concerns posed by political campaigns hoovering up voters’ personal data: “If the individuals wish to remain more private then they shouldn’t consent to give up their information.”","As Trump surged in the polls, Sheryl Sandberg told investors the election was 'a big deal in terms of ad spend'","As I read through Nix’s comments in my notes two years later, I am struck by the similarity between his logic and that of Facebook. In rejecting the media’s characterisation of this large-scale privacy violation as a “data breach”, Facebook claims “everyone involved” in the 2014 data-siphoning exercise had given their consent. “People knowingly provided their information,” the company claimed. As with its interpretation of the word “clear”, Facebook seems to have a skewed understanding of what “knowingly” really means.","Facebook’s senior executives may now be feeling apologetic, “outraged” even. But in January 2016, as Trump surged in the polls, Facebook’s COO, Sheryl Sandberg, told investors the 2016 election was “a big deal in terms of ad spend”. In other words, a major commercial opportunity. The ability to target voters, she said, was key: “Using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those,” she boasted. “And we’re seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting.”","It’s perhaps worth remembering, then, that until recently Facebook was encouraging political operatives to take full advantage of its garden of surveillance. And while aspects of the Cambridge Analytica affair may be surprising, and offer a disturbing glimpse into the shadows, the routine exploitation of information about our lives – about who we are – is what’s powering Facebook. It’s the behemoth’s lifeblood."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Zuckerberg has been thinking and talking about privacy ever since he built the predecessor to Facebook, called Facemash, at Harvard back in 2003. When users of the service complained that their pictures were being used without permission, Zuckerberg took the site down and apologized.","Since then, a fairly consistent pattern has emerged. Zuckerberg and other Facebook employees rarely talk about \"privacy,\" but rather operate from the assumption that people want to share information, as long as they can control how it's used. And as was the case with Facemash, sometimes the company goes too far -- in which case Zuckerberg apologizes, Facebook makes changes, and life goes on.","Here's a comprehensive look at what Zuckerberg has said about privacy and controlling data, according to CNBC research and Michael Zimmer's \"Zuckerberg files.\"","'Issues about violating people's privacy don't seem to be surmountable'","Harvard's student newspaper interviewed Zuckerberg in 2003 about his pre-Facebook project, facemash.com, which asked students to rate the attractiveness of their classmates. Pictures were scraped from housing websites and uploaded.","The website quickly caused outrage and was permanently taken down. A then-19-year-old Zuckerberg said:","\"I don't see how it can go back online. Issues about violating people's privacy don't seem to be surmountable. The primary concern is hurting people's feelings. I'm not willing to risk insulting anyone.\"","In an apology letter, he wrote, \"I hope you understand, this is not how I meant for things to go, and I apologize for any harm done as a result of my neglect to consider how quickly the site would spread and its consequences thereafter...I definitely see how my intentions could be seen in the wrong light.\"","'There are pretty intensive privacy options'","Zuckerberg built the first version of Facebook from the ashes of Facemash. In 2004, with just hundreds signed on, Zuckerberg made sure to clarify that the extensive search capabilities were countered by privacy options for members who didn't want everyone to be able to look up their information.","\"You can limit who can see your information, if you only want current students to see your information, or people in your year, in your house, in your classes. You can limit a search so that only a friend or a friend of a friend can look you up. People have very good control over who can see their information.\"","'We're not forcing anyone to publicize any information about themselves'","Early Facebook investor Jim Breyer interviewed Mark Zuckerberg in 2005, during which Zuckerberg responded to an audience question about his approach to the ethical and legal implications of monetizing Facebook.","\"But in terms of the ethical implications of creating this? I mean what I kind of saw this as is enabling out for your flow of information.... We're not asking anyone to put anything out there that they wouldn't be comfortable putting out. We're not forcing anyone to publicize any information about themselves. We give people pretty good control over their privacy. I mean you can make it so that no one can see anything, or no one can see your profile unless they're your friend. And I think that we encourage people to use that stuff. We point people to it.\"","You can watch the full presentation here. Zuckerberg's comments on ethics start around 41:20:","'We're obviously really sensitive to people's privacy'","Zuckerberg delivered a guest lecture moderated Professor Michael D. Smith at Harvard in 2005, where he talked about Facebook's expansion from Harvard to other schools. The idea of privacy and data usage came up:","\"We have a lot of stuff that we put in place to make sure that people don't aggregate information off of Facebook. Obviously, you can't see profiles of people at other schools. But also, if you try to view a lot of profiles, it picks up that you're just viewing an abnormal number of profiles. By analyzing user activity, we've built Bayesian filters that let us pick out abnormal activity really quickly and just show very limited information to those users .... We're obviously really sensitive to people's privacy.\"","'We simply did a bad job'","In 2007, Facebook faced its first big privacy flap after it had expanded beyond universities to the general population. The company introduced Beacon, which allowed third-party sites to publish user purchases unless users opted out. That meant that some users unwittingly broadcast to their friends information like their movie purchases from Blockbuster or plane ticket purchases from Travelocity.","Zuckerberg addressed it in a Facebook blog post that has since been archived:","\"We've made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we've made even more with how we've handled them. We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it. . . . Instead of acting quickly, we took too long to decide on the right solution. I'm not proud of the way we've handled this situation and I know we can do better....","We were excited about Beacon because we believe a lot of information people want to share isn't on Facebook, and if we found the right balance, Beacon would give people an easy and controlled way to share more of that information with their friends.","But we missed the right balance. At first we tried to make it very lightweight so people wouldn't have to touch it for it to work. The problem with our initial approach of making it an opt-out system instead of opt-in was that if someone forgot to decline to share something, Beacon still went ahead and shared it with their friends.\"","Zuckerberg's Law","\"I would expect that next year, people will share twice as much information as they share this year, and next year, they will be sharing twice as much as they did the year before,\" he said. \"That means that people are using Facebook, and the applications and the ecosystem, more and more.\"","His remarks were later dubbed \"Zuckerberg's Law.\"","'We're just going to keep on moving more and more' toward openness","Zuckerberg spoke to Wired in 2009 about the creation of public profiles:","\"Just a couple of weeks ago we announced this open privacy setting where prior to that it was impossible for someone to take their profile and say that they wanted it to be open. Now they can do that. They can say it's open to everyone. And what I would just expect is that as time goes on, we're just going to keep on moving more and more in that direction....Just from the launches that we've had, it's pretty clear that we haven't mastered the art of moving people along in terms of change, making these changes; but I think we're getting better at it.\"","The 'social norm' of privacy has evolved over time","Zuckerberg responded to a question about \"pushing the envelope\" on privacy during an award speech in 2010:","\"It's interesting looking back, right? When we got started — just a night in my dorm room at Harvard — the question a lot of people asked is, 'Why would I want any information on the internet at all? Like, why would I want to have a website?' And then, in the last five or six years, blogging has taken off in a huge way, and all these different services that have people sharing more information. And people have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information — and different kinds — but more openly with more people. And that social norm is just something that's evolved over time. And we view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and updating what our system is, to reflect what the current social norms are. A lot of companies would be trapped by the conventions, and their legacy of the systems that they've built. Doing a privacy change for 350 million users is really it's not about the type of thing that a lot of companies would do. But I think we view that is a really important thing to always kind of keep a beginner's mind and think, 'What would we do if we were starting about the company now, and the site now? ' We decided that these would be the social norms now and we just went for it.\"","'What people want isn't complete privacy .... they want control'","\"The way that people think about privacy is changing a bit ... What people want isn't complete privacy. It isn't that they want secrecy. It's that they want control over what they share and what they don't.\"","'Some people don't understand how their personal information is used'","Zuckerberg wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2010, in which he outlined Facebook's principles for privacy:","\"We have also heard that some people don't understand how their personal information is used and worry that it is shared in ways they don't want. I'd like to clear that up now. Many people choose to make some of their information visible to everyone so people they know can find them on Facebook. We already offer controls to limit the visibility of that information and we intend to make them even stronger.","Here are the principles under which Facebook operates:","— You have control over how your information is shared.","— We do not share your personal information with people or services you don't want.","— We do not give advertisers access to your personal information.","— We do not and never will sell any of your information to anyone.","— We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone.\"","'Applications have to ask for permission'","\"There's this false rumor that's been going around which says that we're sharing private information with applications and it's just not true. The way it works, is ... if you choose to share some information with everyone on the site, that means that any person can go look up that information and any application can go look up that information as well. ... But applications have to ask for permission for anything that you've set to be private.\"","'There have been misperceptions that we're trying to make all information open, but that's false'","He discussed the \"serendipitous connections\" that Facebook enables in on stage in 2010:","\"Privacy is very important to us. I think there are some misperceptions. People use Facebook to share and to stay connected. You don't start off on Facebook being connected to your friends, you've got to be able to find them. So having some information available broadly is good for that. Now, there have been misperceptions that we're trying to make all information open, but that's false. We encourage people to keep their most private information private. But some of the most basic information, we suggest that people leave public.","\"We recommend settings for people, and we asked that everyone review their settings and make a choice about what they wanted them to be. We didn't simply change them….The big feedback that we got was that the privacy settings had become too complex. Over the years we'd just accumulated many, many settings.","\"More than 50 percent of Facebook users have changed their privacy settings at one point. That demonstrates that our users understand the tools, he says. 'To me, that's a signal that on the whole, we're getting it right and giving people the control they want.'","'We realize that people will probably criticize us for this for a long time'","\"If I could choose to share my mobile-phone number only with everyone on Facebook, I wouldn't do it. But because I can do it with only my friends I do it.","A lot of people who are worried about privacy and those kinds of issues will take any minor misstep that we make and turn it into as big a deal as possible,\" he said. \"We realize that people will probably criticize us for this for a long time, but we just believe that this is the right thing to do.\"","'Everyone needs complete control over who they share with at all times'","Zuckerberg shared a Facebook note to his personal page in 2011 after the FTC signed a consent decree governing Facebook's use of personal data. He said:","\"I founded Facebook on the idea that people want to share and connect with people in their lives, but to do this everyone needs complete control over who they share with at all times....","This idea has been the core of Facebook since day one. When I built the first version of Facebook, almost nobody I knew wanted a public page on the internet. That seemed scary. But as long as they could make their page private, they felt safe sharing with their friends online. Control was key. With Facebook, for the first time, people had the tools they needed to do this. That's how Facebook became the world's biggest community online. We made it easy for people to feel comfortable sharing things about their real lives....","I'm the first to admit that we've made a bunch of mistakes. In particular, I think that a small number of high profile mistakes, like Beacon four years ago and poor execution as we transitioned our privacy model two years ago, have often overshadowed much of the good work we've done... not one day goes by when I don't think about what it means for us to be the stewards of this community and their trust.\"","On the decree and the hiring of chief privacy officers, Zuckerberg said:","\"[T]his means we're making a clear and formal long-term commitment to do the things we've always tried to do and planned to keep doing -- giving you tools to control who can see your information and then making sure only those people you intend can see it .... As a matter of fact, privacy is so deeply embedded in all of the development we do that every day tens of thousands of servers worth of computational resources are consumed checking to make sure that on any webpage we serve, that you have access to see each of the sometimes hundreds or even thousands of individual pieces of information that come together to form a Facebook page....","We do privacy access checks literally tens of billions of times each day to ensure we're enforcing that only the people you want see your content. These privacy principles are written very deeply into our code. .... We will continue to improve the service, build new ways for you to share and offer new ways to protect you and your information better than any other company in the world.\"","'Giving people control over what they share is a fundamental principle'","\"[W]e hope to rewire the way people spread and consume information. We think the world's information infrastructure should resemble the social graph — a network built from the bottom up or peer-to-peer, rather than the monolithic, top-down structure that has existed to date. We also believe that giving people control over what they share is a fundamental principle of this rewiring.\"","In response to reports about the PRISM surveillance program and other revelations from activist Edward Snowden:","\"When governments ask Facebook for data, we review each request carefully to make sure they always follow the correct processes and all applicable laws, and then only provide the information if it is required by law. We will continue fighting aggressively to keep your information safe and secure.","We strongly encourage all governments to be much more transparent about all programs aimed at keeping the public safe. It's the only way to protect everyone's civil liberties and create the safe and free society we all want over the long term.\"","'We go out of our way to help fix issues'","In early March 2014, reports surfaced that the National Security Agency posed as Facebook in controversial surveillance program. Zuckerberg responded to the allegations by telling users that he was \"so confused\" and frustrated that the U.S. government might have undermined his security engineers.","\"To keep the internet strong, we need to keep it secure. That's why at Facebook we spend a lot of our energy making our services and the whole internet safer and more secure. We encrypt communications, we use secure protocols for traffic, we encourage people to use multiple factors for authentication and we go out of our way to help fix issues we find in other people's services....","Unfortunately, it seems like it will take a very long time for true full reform. So it's up to us -- all of us -- to build the internet we want. Together, we can build a space that is greater and a more important part of the world than anything we have today, but is also safe and secure. I'm committed to seeing this happen, and you can count on Facebook to do our part.\"","'The kind of privacy that no one had ever seen before'","Earnings conference call (July 2014)","Zuckerberg spoke about privacy on the company's earnings call in July 2014:","\"I think something that's misunderstood about Facebook. One of the things that we focused on the most is creating private spaces for people to share things and have interactions that they couldn't have had elsewhere. So, if you go back to the very beginning of Facebook, rewind 10 years, I mean there were blogs and things where you could be completely public and there were e-mails, right? So, you could circulate something completely privately. But there was no space where you could share with just your friends, right? I mean it wasn't a completely private experience, but it's not completely public and it's 100 or 150 of the people that you care about.","And creating that space which was a space that had the kind of privacy that no one had ever seen before was what enabled and continues to enable the kind of interactions and the content that people feel comfortable sharing in this network that don't exist in other places in the world.","So, we're constantly looking for new opportunities to create new dynamics like that and open up new different private spaces for people where they can then feel comfortable sharing and having the freedom to express things that you otherwise wouldn't be able to.\"","'Facebook stands with many technology companies to protect you and your information.'","Reposting a comment from subsidiary WhatsApp, Zuckerberg said: \"Facebook stands with many technology companies to protect you and your information.\"","The original post, written by WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum, said:","\"The purpose of security is to safeguard privacy. Billions of people share their most personal, intimate information using services like ours, and they expect all of us to keep it safe from criminals and other bad guys. Asking a single company to undermine the security of its product for an investigation threatens the security of all of us in the long run.","Today, WhatsApp and other companies are asking a U.S. court to overturn an order that would require Apple to weaken the security of its product. We are proud to stand together to demonstrate how these efforts go beyond what the law allows and how they compromise the values upon which our country is built.\"","'Keeping our community safe does not require compromising privacy'","\"As we discuss keeping our community safe, it is important to emphasize that part of keeping people safe is protecting individual security and liberty. We are strong advocates of encryption and have built it into the largest messaging platforms in the world — WhatsApp and Messenger. Keeping our community safe does not require compromising privacy. Since building end-to-end encryption into WhatsApp, we have reduced spam and malicious content by more than 75%.The path forward is to recognize that a global community needs social infrastructure to keep us safe from threats around the world, and that our community is uniquely positioned to prevent disasters, help during crises, and rebuild afterwards. Keeping the global community safe is an important part of our mission — and an important part of how we'll measure our progress going forward.\"","'We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you'"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

Credit: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg","Facebook is shutting down a rich source of third-party consumer data flowing to advertisers as a way to steel up the integrity of the platform following the Cambridge Analytica leak.","On Wednesday, Facebook said it would remove ad targeting options that relied on consumer data from third-parties such as Acxiom, Oracle Data Cloud, Experian, Epsilon, and others. These data providers have some of the deepest insights into consumer behavior across the world—information on what people buy, where they shop, what kind of cars they drive, health profiles, incomes, family makeup—and they are integral to the entire digital ad ecosystem.","“We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories,” a Facebook spokeswoman said in an e-mail statement. “This product enables third-party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.”","Partner Categories are part of the targeting options within the Facebook ad platform that can help define the audience for an advertiser, and they show how many people could be reached within specific target groups.","The data come from these third-parties, which is why Facebook is shutting them down. Earlier this month, it was discovered that Cambridge Analytica, also a third-party data provider, abused Facebook user data, and may have stored and shared the data against Facebook’s policies.","Cambridge Analytica is being investigated in the U.S. and U.K. for allegedly using underhanded tactics to impact the Brexit vote and the 2016 presidential elections. It’s also been accused of using its illicit Facebook data to exert untoward influence over voters.","Facebook is waiting on an audit by U.K. authorities to say for sure whether Cambridge Analytica kept its user data despite being told to erase the profiles years ago. Facebook has also been reviewing its internal policies and promised to audit any other third party developers who may have had similar access to data.","The plan to phase out the third-party data providers will not impact Custom Audiences, according to Facebook. Custom Audiences are targeting lists based on data owned by the advertiser.","Some of the third-party data providers also help with measuring ad campaigns, analyzing data like sales impact and brand sentiment. Facebook says they will still be engaged in that work.","Advertisers like consumer goods brands are particularly reliant on this type of third-party data, because they don’t have direct lines to collect consumer data when most of the purchases of their products happen at stores they don’t own. The third parties can give them valuable consumer insights.","“For some clients, this is a big part of how they advertise on Facebook,” says a digital agency executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. “But in a way it’s fair. If Facebook is being held to account for third-party data collection being turned into targeting on the platform, they either have to audit the collection practices or just say no more. You can’t do it on the platform anymore.”","Meanwhile, rivals like Google, Snapchat and Twitter all have similar third-party targeting tools. Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s VP of global ad sales, said last week that the company would try to turn its data deficiency into an advantage by reshaping the conversation around privacy and consumer information online.","“I think we have an opportunity to lead in the conversation around how consumer data is protected,” Everson told AdAge in a phone interview last week.","The data troubles and consumer backlash has exposed Facebook in a way that strikes at the heart of its business. It’s main source of value is the data machine it built that promises to understand its 2 billion users and target ads in an unprecedented way.","Now advertisers say Facebook is trying to reposition the business, relying less on mining personal information for hyper-targeted ads. It is emphasizing the vast reach of the platform more than just the deep data insights.","“There is a silver lining for Facebook shutting down access to data,” says another digital advertiser, speaking on condition of anonymity. “They are using that as a reason to promote the reach and frequency side of the business like television.”","About Us","Breaking News Home\nHome Of Information Around The World.","Is an advanced news hub, which covers all sphere of news line.

{"originalurl":"http://www.lifehacker.co.uk/2018/03/23/dont-delete-facebook-just-be-smarter-on-facebook","title":"Don't Delete Facebook—Just Be Smarter on Facebook | Lifehacker UK","text":["Don't Delete Facebook—Just Be Smarter on Facebook","Facebook is kind of a mess right now. And there are plenty of equally messy reaction pieces cajoling you, and everyone you know, to delete your account in a massive middle finger to the web’s prevailing social network. That’s the easy take and, honestly, we’ve experienced this mob response before. Did you #DeleteFacebook then? Me neither.","We think it’s worth considering a more measured approach. The sky might be falling, but you can still be a lot smarter about social media—what data you share with it and what data you let third-party apps and services see—without opting out of social networking entirely. There’s still some good left in Facebook. Let’s consider all our options before doing anything rash.","Should you really delete Facebook this time? Maybe.","If you’re overly concerned about Facebook’s data-collection practices (or how the data you thought you entrusted to Facebook suddenly ends up in the hands of entities you’ve never heard of), you’ll probably feel a lot better if you start distancing yourself from the social network. It’s healthier, too. Let’s recap the three major techniques you can try:","Just stop using the social network","If you have the willpower, remove the Facebook bookmark from your web browser. Retrain your hand to stop typing in “www.fa...” every time you open a new tab. Go learn a hobby. Take up an MMO. Start a celebrity Instagram account for your plant—er, maybe not that.","Facebook has burned its users plenty of times with its data collection policies, but we all keep chugging on. Facebook isn’t going anywhere, but you can certainly work to lessen your day-to-day involvement with the service (and, as a result, the data you’re feeding the Facebook Monster).","I really, really hate Facebook’s “these random friends of yours we pulled from your feed are totallllly going to be sad if you leave no really” begging. Come on, already.","If you can’t compel yourself to stop visiting Facebook, the company can help. Facebook will still have your data, of course, but you’ll get a chance to take a breather and (hopefully) depend less on the digital platform when you’re ready to jump back in.","Deactivating your account leaves some of your information up on Facebook—like conversations you’ve had with your friends—but it will make it impossible for others to find your profile and you will no longer be tagged in most pieces of content.","When you’re ready to say goodbye, let Facebook know, and be prepared to stay away from your account. Deleting everything about you takes some time—up to 90 days—and if you log back in before Facebook “wipes” your account, this might interrupt the process. Change your mind, and you’ll have to start the countdown all over again.","The deletion process is fairly extreme, so make sure you’ve set up your digital life before you depart. That includes transferring ownership of any pages or groups you manage to those who will carry the torch once your profile has vanished into the digital ether. Don’t forget to log out of all Facebook sessions and remove the apps from your mobile devices. And don’t use Facebook’s single-sign-on feature to log into websites anymore, lest you accidentally stop your account’s deletion.","But wait!","Before you nuke your account, or even try to reduce your reliance on Facebook, there are a number of steps you also can take to retain the benefits of social networking with a lot more data privacy. Besides, even deleting your account isn’t going to retract the data you already let other sites and services have access to.","You can be both irritated with Facebook’s actions and a regular user of the service. You just have to be a little better about how you engage with Facebook. Here are some ways to maximise its usefulness while minimising its invasion into your life:","Stop signing in with Facebook","How many apps and services have access to some aspect of your Facebook data? Do you even know? You should.","It’s convenient to press a blue button and log into various sites and services with your Facebook credentials. But when you give other companies access to your Facebook data—which can be quite comprehensive—you’re surrendering control of that information to entities that probably don’t care very much about you or your privacy. Stop doing that. Use a handy password manager to create and keep track of your logins and passwords instead. And if an app demands you sign into Facebook to use it, find an alternative.","If you’re a gamer who just can’t find friends in your favourite online titles without connecting your Facebook account, we understand. At the very least, be picky about who gets to access your account—perhaps a larger service like Valve’s Steam is a better idea than some random app developer who wants permission to access all of your Facebook information and connections.","Open up your favourite calendar service and make a recurring, quarterly appointment to pull up this page. Look at the apps and games. If you don’t remember using the app or game since the last time your calendar reminder went off, remove its ability to access your data. Repeat in three months.","You’ll just have to go and make friends the old-fashioned way on your other favorite app and gaming platforms.","Facebook wants as much information as it can get about you, your friends, and everyone you know. This allows the service to more effectively serve you advertising. You won’t win this cat-and-mouse game, but you can at least offer a little resistance to Facebook’s efforts.","On the same page where you pruned Facebook apps from being able to access your data, click “Edit” under Apps, Websites and Plugins to turn off Facebook’s ability to integrate with all third-party apps and websites—the nuclear bomb of approaches. You’ll lose the ability to log into other entities using Facebook, and any data you’ve already shared with other apps and websites is still theirs to do with as they please, but you’ll at least put a slightly larger lock around your data.","Friends don’t let friends tell apps their entire life story and every detail about them.","If you still want to be able to use Facebook on some other applications you trust, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has some excellent advice:","“...there is another setting that can help: limiting the personal information accessible by apps that others use. By default, other people who can see your info can bring it with them when they use apps, and your info becomes available to those apps. You can limit this as follows.”","On the same page as before, look for the “Apps Others Use” section. Click “Edit,” and you can then be a lot picker about what information your friends can pull into their apps. Our advice? Uncheck everything. This one is a biggie. Don’t overlook it.","Limit the data Facebook knows about you","Maybe Facebook doesn’t need to know your sign. Just a thought.","I hate putting my birthday on Facebook because I find it annoying to get “happy birthdayyyyy!!!!!!” messages from people I never interact with the other 364 days of the year.","The same principle can easily apply to data security. Are you gaining anything by telling Facebook your birthday? If not, remove it. Does Facebook really need to know your work email? Probably not. Your address? Nope. The location of every place you visit? Doubtful.","Consider your life’s details need-to-know; while Facebook is great for sharing pictures of your cats, maybe it doesn’t need a dossier on you—at least not one you deliver it yourself. Sure, it’ll probably just get this information anyway when one of your friends lets Facebook access their entire contact list—if they’re good about keeping that information current—but it’s a start.","Beef up your browser security","To keep Facebook from tracking your activities around the web, all you have to do is grab a simple browser add-on that you should really be using anyway to cut down on annoying advertisements. Install uBlock Origin for Firefox or Chrome and pull up its options menu. Go to the “3rd-party filters” tab and search for “Fanboy’s Social Blocking list.” Activate that.","Filters, filters everywhere, and we love them all.","The browser add-on Privacy Badger is even easier to use—ideal for your non-techie friends—but we do love the uBlock Origin’s thoroughness.","Also, don’t forget to head on over to Facebook’s Ad Preferences page and indicate that you don’t want Facebook to show you ads based on your personal data. Or, at the very least, set what data you think is acceptable for Facebook to use for personalized advertising.","Consider starting over from scratch","I like to reinstall my desktop’s operating system once a year because it’s a lot easier to build a fresh, clean PC from the ground up than to try and apply a bunch of band-aids to a gunked-up machine. If you’re truly unhappy with Facebook’s data collection, delete your account... and then make a new one.","Hear me out.","My next name on Facebook will be Dorothy Mantooth.","Before you start making the new you, incorporate many (or all) of our above suggestions to keep your privacy as locked down as you can make it. Then, as you begin to design your new Facebook account, obfuscate your details. Make a new dummy email address that you only use for Facebook. Don’t share that email address with any other people or apps. Use a fake name, but one close enough your real one so that your friends will be able to tell who you are.","Don’t give Facebook any other real details about your life unless they’re absolutely necessary for your enjoyment of the service. Lock down your privacy settings so you are in complete control of tags, who can friend you, and who can see anything you ever post—if anything. If you’re really feeling like a hermit, don’t upload any photographs and don’t let anyone else tag you in theirs. Don’t allow people to find your fake information in search engines.","Basically, treat Facebook like a fancier RSS reader (if that). Extract every bit of usefulness from the service that you can get and give it nothing it can use against you in return. Fair is fair, right?"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

Then, he deleted those tweets.","Known for bursts of candidness on Twitter, Stamos has tweeted out his thoughts on a range of issues during his tenure at Facebook.

Suddenly, more individuals could compete, connect, collaborate and create with more other people, in more ways, from more places, for less money and with greater ease than ever before. And we sure did!","We became our own filmmakers and reporters; we launched political and social revolutions from our living rooms; we connected with long-lost family and friends; we found the answers to old and new questions with one click; we searched for everything from spouses to news to directions to kindred spirits with our phones; we exposed dictators and branded ourselves. With one touch, we could suddenly call a taxi, direct a taxi, rate a taxi and pay a taxi — or rent an igloo, rate an igloo and pay for an igloo in Alaska.","And then, just as suddenly, we found ourselves in the second inning. The cool self-driving car killed a pedestrian; the cool Facebook platform enabled Russian troll farms to divide us and inject fake news into our public life; the uncool totalitarian government learned how to use the same facial recognition tools that can ease your way through passport control to single you out in a crowd for arrest.","And Mark Zuckerberg, who promised to connect us all — and that it would all be good — found himself on the cover of Wired magazine, with his face cut, bruised and bandaged, as if he’d been hit by a fastball. He wasn’t alone. In inning two, we started to feel beat up by the same platforms and technologies that had enriched, empowered and connected our lives.","Silicon Valley, we have a problem.","What to do? For problems like this, I like to consult my teacher and friend Dov Seidman, CEO of LRN, which helps companies and leaders build ethical cultures, and the author of the book, “How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything.”","“The first inning’s prevailing ethos was that any technology that makes the world more open by connecting us or makes us more equal by empowering us individually must, in and of itself, be a force for good,” Seidman began. “But, in inning two, we are coming to grips with the reality that the power to make the world more open and equal is not in the technologies themselves. It all depends on how the tools are designed and how we choose to use them. The same amazing tech that enables people to forge deeper relationships, foster closer communities and give everyone a voice can also breed isolation, embolden racists, and empower digital bullies and nefarious actors.”","Equally important, Seidman added, these “unprecedented and valuable tools of connection” are being used with great accuracy and potency “to assault the foundations of what makes our democracies vibrant, capitalism dynamic and our societies healthy — namely, truth and trust.”","And they have begun to be used “to assault our personal foundations — our privacy and sense of identity,” Seidman said: “It is one thing to use our data to enable better shopping experiences, but when my beliefs and attitudes are mined and manipulated for someone’s political campaign, a campaign that may be antithetical to my beliefs, that is deeply harmful and unmooring.” So what to do? “Precisely because we are in just the beginning of a technological revolution with a long, uncertain, up-and-down road ahead, we need to start by pausing to reflect on how our world, reshaped by these technologies, operates differently — and on the kind of values and leadership we will need to realize their promise.”","Values are more vital now than ever, Seidman insisted. “Because sustainable values are what anchor us in a storm, and because values propel and guide us when our lives are profoundly disrupted. They help us make the hard decisions.” Hard decisions abound, because everything is now connected. “The world is fused. So there no place anymore to stand to the side and claim neutrality — to say, ‘I am just a businessperson’ or ‘I am just running a platform.’ ”","No way. “Once you see that your technologies are having unintended consequences, you cannot maintain your neutrality — especially when you’ve become so central to the lives of billions of people.”","In the fused world, Seidman said, “the business of business is no longer just business. The business of business is now society. And, therefore, how you take or don’t take responsibility for what your technology enables or for what happens on your platforms is inescapable. This is the emerging expectation of users — real people — who’ve entrusted so much of their inner lives to these powerful companies.”","To be sure, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should all be commended for trying to find engineering solutions to prevent them from being hacked and weaponized.","“But this is not just an engineering problem, or just a business model problem,” he said. “Software solutions can increase our confidence that we can stay a step ahead of the bad guys. But, fundamentally, it will take more ‘moralware’ to regain our trust. Only one kind of leadership can respond to this kind of problem — moral leadership.”","What does moral leadership look like here?","“Moral leadership means truly putting people first and making whatever sacrifices that entails,” said Seidman. “That means not always competing on shallow things and quantity — on how much time people spend on your platform — but on quality and depth. It means seeing and treating people not just as ‘users’ or ‘clicks,’ but as ‘citizens,’ who are worthy of being accurately informed to make their best choices. It means not just trying to shift people from one click to another, from one video to another, but instead trying to elevate them in ways that deepen our connections and enrich our conversations.”","It means, Seidman continued, being “fully transparent about how you operate, and make decisions that affect them — all the ways in which you’re monetizing their data. It means having the courage to publish explicit standards of quality and expectations of conduct, and fighting to maintain them however inconvenient. It means having the humility to ask for help even from your critics. It means promoting civility and decency, making the opposite unwelcome. It means being truly bold — proclaiming, for example, that you will not sleep until you’re certain that our next democratic election won’t be hacked.”","At the height of the Cold War, when the world was threatened by spreading Communism and rising walls, President John F. Kennedy vowed to “pay any price and bear any burden” to ensure the success of liberty.","Today, falling walls and spreading webs — which criminals and nations can use to poison democratic societies — are becoming the biggest threat to the success of liberty. You will know that the good guys are winning when you see big tech companies rise to Kennedy’s challenge — to pay any price and bear any burden to protect us from the downsides of the technologies they’ve created."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Hundreds if not thousands of pages of code, as well as detailed notes signed by AggregateIQ staff, wholly substantiate recent reports that Cambridge Analytica’s software platform was not its own creation.","Advertisement","What’s more, the files reveal that AggregateIQ—also known as “AIQ”—is the developer behind campaign apps created for Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, as well as a Ukrainian steel magnate named Serhiy Taruta, head the country’s newly formed Osnova party.","Other records show the firm once pitched an app to Breitbart News, the far-right website funded by hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer—Cambridge Analytica’s principal investor—and are currently contracted by WPA Intelligence, a US-based consultancy founded by Republican pollster Chris Wilson, who was director of digital strategy for Cruz’s 2016 presidential campaign.","A screenshot shows an AIQ developer working on code for Cambridge Analytica’s Ripon software in August 2015.","A screenshot shows an AIQ developer working on code for Cambridge Analytica’s Ripon software in September 2015.","A screenshot shows an AIQ developer working on code for Cambridge Analytica’s Ripon software in mid-2015. In one line, the developer mentions integration with Ted Cruz’s app, “Cruz Crew.”","A screenshot shows an AIQ developer working on code for Cambridge Analytica’s Ripon software in August 2015.","1 / 4","Advertisement","The files were unearthed last week by Chris Vickery, research director at UpGuard, a California-based cyber risk firm. On Sunday night, after Gizmodo reached out to Jeff Silvester, co-founder of AIQ, the files were quickly taken offline.","The files are likely to draw the interest of investigators on both sides of the Atlantic. Canadian and British regulators are currently pursuing leads to establish whether multiple “Leave” campaigns illegally coordinated during the 2016 EU referendum.","Ties between AIQ and Cambridge Analytica—the focus of recent widespread furor over the misuse of data pulled from 50 million Facebook accounts—has likewise drawn the interest of US and British authorities. Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix was suspended by his company last week after British reporters published covertly recorded footage showing Nix boasting about bribing and blackmailing political rivals.","Advertisement","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment.","“Ultimately, I found out through some emails that they’re not even doing this work. It was being outsourced to AIQ.”","AIQ is bound by an non-disclosure agreement the company signed in 2014 to take on former client SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, according to a source with direct knowledge of the contract.","Advertisement","In an interview over the weekend with London’s The Observer, Christopher Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, claimed that he helped establish AIQ years ago in an effort to help SCL Group expand its data operations. Silvester denied that Wylie was ever involved on that level, but admits that Wylie helped AIQ land its first big contract.","“We did some work with SCL and had a contract with them in 2014 for some custom software development,” Silvester told Gizmodo. “We last worked with SCL in 2016 and have not worked with them since.”","Data Exposed","UpGuard first discovered code belonging to AIQ last Thursday on the web page of a developer named Ali Yassine who worked for SCL Group. Within the code—uploaded to the website GitHub in August 2016—are notes that show SCL had requested that code be turned over by AIQ’s lead developer, Koji Hamid Pourseyed.","Advertisement","AIQ’s contract with SCL, a portion of which was published by The Guardian last year, stipulates that SCL is the sole owner of the intellectual property pertaining to the contract—namely, the development of Ripon, Cambridge Analytica’s campaign platform.","The find led UpGuard to unearth a code repository on AIQ’s website. Within it were countless files linking AIQ to the Ripon program, as well as notes related to active projects for Cruz, Abbott, and the Ukrainian oligarch.","A mockup of a “meme generator” being developed by AIQ for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s phone app.","Advertisement","In an internal wiki, AIQ developers also discussed a project known as The Database of Truth, a system that “integrates, obtains, and normalizes data from disparate sorces, including starting with the RNC Data Trust.” (RNC Data Trust is the Republican party’s primary voter file provider.) “The primary data source will be combined with state voter files, consumer data, third party data providers, historical WPA survey and projects and customer data.”","The Database of Truth, according to the wiki, is a project under development for WPA Intelligence.","Screenshot: AIQ","Advertisement","Wilson told Gizmodo on Monday that he has almost no knowledge of the controversy unfolding over AIQ’s role in the UK. “I would never work with a firm that I felt had done something illegal or even unethical,” he said. AIQ’s work for WPA followed a competitive bid process, he said. “They offered us the best capabilities for the best price.”","Vaporware","Until recently, Cambridge Analytica operated largely in the shadows. For years, it planned to target right-leaning voters for a host of high-profile political campaigns, working for both Cruz and President Donald Trump. With its billionaire backing, the firm promised to leverage oceans of data collected about voters—which we now know was acquired from sources both legal and unauthorized.","Advertisement","Known as Project Ripon, Cambridge Analytica’s goal was to furnish Republican candidates with a technology platform capable of reaching voters through the use of psychological profiling. (SCL Group has long used behavioral research to conduct “influence operations” on behalf of military and political clients worldwide.)","Cambridge Analytica, which eventually chose AIQ to help build its platform, once boasted that it possessed files on as many as 230 million Americans compiled from thousands of data points, including psychological data harvested from social media, as well as commercial data available to virtually anyone who can afford it. The company intended to classify voters by select personality types, applying its system to craft messages, online ads, and mailers that, it believed, would resonate distinctively with voters of each group.","Sources within the Cruz campaign, which largely funded Ripon’s development, claim the software never actually functioned. One former staffer told Gizmodo the product was nothing but “vaporware.”","Advertisement","AIQ’s internal files show the company had unlimited access to the Ripon code, and a source within the Cruz campaign confirmed to Gizmodo that AIQ was solely responsible for the software’s development.","The campaign eventually dumped more than $5.8 million into Ripon’s development—which is only about half the amount Robert Mercer, Cambridge Analytica’s principal investor, poured into Cruz’s White House bid. (After Trump took the nomination, Mercer contributed more than $15.5 million to his campaign, $5 million of which ended up back in Cambridge Analytica’s pockets.)","A former Cruz aide, who requested anonymity to discuss their work for the campaign, told Gizmodo that even at the highest levels, no one knew that Cambridge Analytica had outsourced Ripon’s development. “Ultimately, I found out through some emails that they’re not even doing this work,” the source said. “It was being outsourced to AIQ.”","Advertisement","According to the aide, when Cruz’s staff began to question AIQ over whether it was behind Ripon’s development, AIQ confirmed that it was, but said it was never supposed to discuss its work.","The Brexit","In 2016, Mercer reportedly offered up Cambridge Analytica’s services for free to Leave.EU, one of several group urging the UK to depart the European Union, according to The Guardian. Leave.EU was not, however, the official “Leave” group representing the Brexit campaign. Instead, a seperate group, known as Vote Leave, was formally chosen by election officials to lead the referendum.","Advertisement","Whereas Leave.EU relied on Cambridge to influence voters through its use of data analytics, Vote Leave turned to AIQ, eventually paying the firm roughly 40 percent of its £7 million campaign budget, according to The Guardian. Over time, however, Vote Leave amassed more cash than it was legally allowed to spend. While UK election laws permitted Vote Leave to gift its remaining funds to other campaigns, further coordination between them was expressly forbidden.","“All of the direction for BeLeave came from BeLeave and all of the direction for Vote Leave came from Vote Leave.”","Roughly a week before the EU referendum, Vote Leave inexplicably donated £625,000 to a young fashion design student named Darren Grimes, the founder of a small, unofficial Brexit campaign called BeLeave. According to a BuzzFeed investigation, Grimes immediately gave a “substantial amount” of the cash he received from Vote Leave to AIQ. Vote Leave also donated £100,000 to another Leave campaign called Veterans for Britain, which, according to TheGuardian, then paid AIQ precisely that amount.","Advertisement","A review of the AIQ files by UpGuard’s Chris Vickery revealed several mentions of Vote Leave and at least one mention of Veterans for Britain, apparently related to website development.","In an interview on Monday, Shahmir Sanni, a former volunteer for Vote Leave campaign, told The Globe and Mail that he had “first-hand knowledge about the alleged wrongdoing in the Brexit campaign.” Sanni, who was 22 when he worked for Vote Leave, said he was “encouraged to spin out” another campaign, but that he had “no control” over the £625,000 that was immediately spent on AIQ’s services.","British authorities are pursuing leads to establish whether BeLeave and Veterans for Britain were merely a conduit through which Vote Leave sought to direct additional funds to AIQ. While the UK Electoral Commission took no action in early 2017, in November it claimed that “new information” had “come to light,” giving the commission “reasonable grounds to suspect an offence may have been committed.”","Advertisement","In an email, the UK Election Commission told Gizmodo its investigation into Vote Leave payments was ongoing.","“All of the direction for BeLeave came from BeLeave and all of the direction for Vote Leave came from Vote Leave,” AIQ’s co-founder told Gizmodo.","Silvester added: “AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates. It has never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity. All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}
