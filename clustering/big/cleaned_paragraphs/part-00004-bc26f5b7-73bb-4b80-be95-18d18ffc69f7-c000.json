The “Facebook Container,” as the new extension is called, isolates your Facebook identity from the rest of the web. That means Facebook will not be able to use your other web activity to send your targeted advertising.","To be clear, this extension wouldn’t have saved users’ data from being compromised as it was in the Cambridge Analytica scandal; and it does nothing to prevent Facebook advertisers from diving into your profile and your activity while on the social network in order to target you with advertisements while browsing Facebook.","However, it is meant to plug at least one of the holes in Facebook’s leaky dam by offering a way for users to prevent Facebook from gaining even more data collected outside its service.","When you install the extension, it deletes your Facebook cookies and logs you out of the social network. The next time you open Facebook, you’ll notice it’s been opened in a blue-colored “container” tab.","From within that tab, you can continue to use Facebook normally. However, if you click a link that would take you to a page off of Facebook, it will load the URL outside the container. Similarly, if you click any Facebook Share buttons outside of Facebook, it will load those in the Facebook container. (But this will send information to Facebook about the website you shared them from, it should be noted.)","In addition, you may not be able to login to third-party apps with your Facebook credentials, and the embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons you see around the web won’t work either.","“This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity,” explains The Firefox Frontier blog. “So it may look different than what you are used to seeing.”","Actually, it may surprise you to find out how widespread your use of Facebook was when outside the social network.","Facebook’s platform and its off-site advertising network allow other sites and apps to access users’ Facebook data even when users aren’t on Facebook itself. Facebook is hardly alone in terms of companies doing this. But it is making headlines over data mishandling, which means it’s a good time for Mozilla to capitalize on consumers’ concerns to share their messages – and tools – focused on data privacy.","Mozilla said it sped up its work on the Facebook Container add-on, which is based on technology it’s been developing over the past couple of years, as it’s seen increasing consumer demand for tools for managing privacy and security.","There are other tools available to help consumers with these issues today, as well, including the Ghostery anti-tracking extension now owned by Cliqz, ad blockers (including those bundled with browsers like Safari), and more.","However, single-purpose tools like this are useful because they allow people to limit some data-sharing activity, without having to take the drastic step of deleting Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

But just why was Facebook able to siphon off records of who its users were contacting — and when — in the first place?","The short answer: Because Google let it. The longer answer: Well, it's complicated.","The social network acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015 — first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app. Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected, that it didn't collect the contents of messages or calls, and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings.","Facebook did not respond to multiple requests for more specifics. The kerfuffle over this data collection, first reported by the website Ars Technica, follows a week of turmoil for the social network involving charges that it allowed political consultants to steal the data of 50 million users in order to influence election.","There's a reason Facebook's actions were restricted to Android phones. Apple locks down app permissions tightly, which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users. \"Apple's fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running, and keep customers in control of the information,'' said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security firm Securosis.","But Android has long been more indulgent.","Until recently, in fact, Google let app developers gain access to a phone's call and text logs. All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts. Once users agreed, Android would then also grant access to those communication histories.","Starting in 2012 with its \"Jelly Bean'' release, Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs, but still required them to agree to all those permissions at once. Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn't work.","Android updates slow to reach users","It wasn't until 2015 when Google released Android 6.0, dubbed \"Marshmallow,'' that Android phones finally split up those permissions. That meant users could agree to share contacts, but reject access to their messaging and phone histories.","That's the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information. But many Android users aren't using the latest version of the software. In fact, they often can't get it even if they want it.","Apple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones, which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will. Google, by contrast, is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions.","Dado Ruvic / Reuters\nA 3D printed Android mascot Bugdroid is seen in front of a Google logo in this illustration taken July 9, 2017.","There are nearly 20,000 Android phone models now in service, and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks. As a result, new Android versions reach users very slowly.","As of January, about 65 per cent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software, introduced in 2017. Less than 1 per cent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android, known as \"Oreo.'' (Many of them are owners of Google's new Pixel phones, which get software updates directly from Google.)","Just over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions, which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs. Last October, Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates, even on phones running older versions of Android.","Unclear if other apps are going as far as Facebook","All that leaves two big questions unanswered. Why did Google set up Android permissions this way? And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup?","Experts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google's advertising-based business model, which — like Facebook — depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads. Apple, meanwhile, derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music.","Another possible factor: Android was playing catch-up with Apple for many years, and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple's App Store. Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive — as Facebook did.","There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection.","Experts say it's not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts, but it's very possible.","\"In a lot of ways, Facebook is the tip of the iceberg,'' said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. \"There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection.''","A Google spokesperson was unable to say how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users' call logs had been sent to app developers. The company declined to comment further.","The role of manufacturers of Android phones for protecting user privacy remains unclear, South Korean mobile device maker LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday in a statement.","\"Privacy is everyone's responsibility — software providers, carriers, as well as device manufacturers,'' said LG, whose smartphones run on the Android operating system.","\"At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution,'' it said. \"If hardware played a role in the breach then we will certainly look into solution options.''","___","AP Technology Writer Youkyung Lee in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

We’re now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”","This is not the first time that print advertising has been used as a means by which to issue an apology in recent weeks. In February, Mother London responded to the nationwide KFC shortage with full-page ads in The Sun and Metro. “FCK”, the advert read. Facebook’s apology was considerably more sombre in tone, written in black text on a plain background, with the Facebook logo resigned to the very end of the page.","More like this:","Having recently worked with clients as diverse as Lurpak, Uber, and Chaka Khan, London-based director Kim Gehrig returns to transatlantic screens this afternoon with a new commercial for American cosmetics brand Covergirl as part of a campaign orchestrated by Droga5.","Photographer Agnes Lloyd-Platt and creative director David Lane, of Lane and Associates, have teamed up once again to bring us the latest campaign for accessories brand Ally Capellino. Each one is set in a distinct and authentic world (you might remember last season’s which was shot in a garden, or the previous one set in a restaurant kitchen) and this is usually determined by the founder herself. “We tend to take whatever Ally is obsessing about and run with it” explains Agnes (who is also Ally’s daughter); the concept for the SS15 campaign, for instance — which paired models with different pastel-coloured shades of hair, with accessories in corresponding colours — was inspired by the fact Ally herself had pink hair that week.","What hasn’t Brian Phillips done? Founder of Black Frame, one of the fashion industry’s most powerful PR companies, Brian has spent the past few years rebranding Helmut Lang, working as the creative director of Garage Magazine and collaborating with the likes of Eckhaus Latta, Nike, Opening Ceremony and Hunter.","Graphic designer Claire Matthews founded independent campaign group Clean Air Now alongside Vasilisa Forbes in 2016. Clean Air Now advocate for positive environmental change in London and across the UK, through billboards, subverts, videos and street art placement.","A new global campaign launched today (6 February) by Absolut features 28 employees of the vodka brand completely naked. Titled the vodka with nothing to hide, the film satirises traditional employee induction videos by using nudity to draw attention to the “transparent” seed-to-bottle production process behind the brand, from the CO2 neutral distillation process to Absolut’s dedication to sustainability.","Imaginative and diverse, artist-cum-photographer Grace Albohm has a self-proclaimed propensity to “romanticise the handwork, labour-intensive and traditional printing of photography,” she says. From curiously found fanzine images brought into the darkroom and made into cyanotypes, to shining a torch through pin-holes cut from cardboard, hers is a practice that opens up the oft-abandoned darkroom and turns it into a place of delightful happenings, and magic.","Berlin-based illustrator Anna Gille brings out the beauty of the natural environment through her illustration series Window (VPPB). The illustrator has been producing images of various landscapes for the past three years forming the basis of her Windows series, working from a large archive of digital photography featuring different kinds of landscapes including parks, gardens, nature reserves and zoos. She collects such photos alongside screenshots of digital simulations and computer game graphics, widening her archive to encompass a broad range of real and artificial topographic documentation.","A retirement village in Berkhamsted might not be the first place you would imagine to find fashion photographer Thurstan Redding — who has shot for the likes of British Vogue, Arena Homme +, i-D, Dazed and Love — but it was here, in Castle Village, that one of his most unique projects thus far took shape.","Walls, a recent children’s book made by illustrator Jay Cover and art director Brad Holdgrafer, is a literal depiction of the political situation in both the US and the UK, a metaphorical exploration of the concept of a wall, and a “playful look at the problem” for the kids it’s aimed at and the parents reading to them, too.

Her beautifully, crisp portfolio of work spans print, digital design and art direction demonstrating a delicate balance between creative expression and logical functionality. Speaking to It’s Nice That, Emily explains that in her creative process, “I need to be able to express something with my designs but when you become too focused on style and expression you often lose the bigger picture,” she says. “I only find meaning in my work when I see its larger role in society — whether that’s functionality, or an ability to provoke reaction, or simply to communicate a message”.","When Lucas Reis was a kid growing up in Brazil, he had a Japanese friend.

This one word sums up everything New York-based design studio DIA embodies. Movement is in the neoteric, kinetic identity systems it creates and the processes it uses to construct them. Moving forward is in the ethos that drives its leaders Mitch Paone and Meg Donohoe to redefine with graphic design is. DIA is always moving and, in turn, its solidified itself as the master of typography in flux. It’s a studio which messes with design theory only to improve it, leaving the rest of us scrambling to catch up. Despite a somewhat-earnest façade, DIA is a studio built upon the interpersonal relationships it harbours, particularly between Mitch, founder and creative director, and Meg, managing partner. “We are on the same page with just about everything,” Mitch explains, “Same taste in design, art, food, architecture, vacations.” This “universal compatibility,” as he describes it, feeds through everything they do, in or outside of work, forming the basis of their collaboration. “Most importantly,” he continues, “there is a balance of our mindsets. Meg steers the ship with a long-term vision, whereas I am very much immersed in immediate creative tasks.”","“I prefer working on projects where there is a personal connection, when I can actually relate to, and believe in, the project that I’m working on,” explains Italian graphic designer, Leonardo Pellegrino. A recent graduate of Central Saint Martins, Leonardo is currently working at Brave New World in London, developing a multidisciplinary portfolio which offers graphic design, filmmaking and art direction.","Blessure magazine, designed by France-based Chambre Charbon, is an alternative magazine drawing similarities between ten to fifteen different artists for every issue. ‘Blessure’ means ‘wound’ in French, referring to the novelist Jean Genet’s words on Giacometti. Genet admired Giacometti’s ability to capture the fundamental, raw essence of objects and people in his work, the encapsulation of a “secret wound” or “blessure secrète”. Similarly, in Blessure, the publication alludes to the sense of style and personality of each artist without text. The communication is solely through the artworks and the design.","The latest issue of Blessure focuses on the use of textures created by the computer, creating a new and contemporary language. There is no text, instead the images craft a unique narrative entirely subjective to each viewer. The tone of the artworks changes depending on the print layout and the other works they are interacting with. The 180-page publication features work from Brenna Murphy, core.pan, Deylan Seu, Everest, Jamie and Rickie McNeill, Marine Léauté, Marvin de Deus Ganhitas, Nicolas Sassoon, Sabrina Ratté, Ulysse C. Müller, Ville Kallio, Yannick ValGesto and Boris Détraz.","“I quickly made the decision to never feature the same artist twice, so that the magazine can mutate as quickly as possible”, Chambre Charbon tells It’s Nice That. Inspired by publications such as Weird magazine by Noel Freibert and Mould Map published by Landfill Editions, Blessure’s objective first and foremost is to focus on the artwork, secondly, on an anti-design aesthetic. Chambre Charbon describes the design as “pretty direct and oddly neutral”, calling itself a magazine in an “ironic” way and purposefully adding no value to the print run by choosing not to use risograph printing or spot colours.","Melbourne-based studio Play on Play has carved out a reputation as the go-to for film titles with substance, finesse, and – as the name suggests – playful humour. Founders Naomi Akikusa-Dawber and Lucy Fry draw inspiration from shop windows and heavy metal album artwork; old horror novels and erotica; ghost signs and vernacular typography; as well as movies “from a time when the titles couldn’t rely on technology”.","Holly McGowan and Sofya Staune created VAJ.Power in Holly’s bedroom in Glasgow as a way to share each other’s knowledge of digital technology.

Their creative process revolves around a process of learning, “we became very interested in why working in 3D animation, modelling and coding are so inaccessible and how to make it more open to all”, VAJ.Power tells It’s Nice That. As a result, >Fuse also hosts workshops in digital technology, investigating the relationship between music and moving image.","“Combining a self-aware sense of humour, with a love of expansive cultural ephemera,” iiii Magazine is an independent arts and culture publication, based in London and Manchester. Started by Jordan Harrison-Twist and Chris Samuel, its content sets no limit on matter or form and it publishes a range of content from incisive criticism, personal essays, humour pieces and “odes to oddities” – all connected by a passion for language.","From stacks of drawings of cut, falling hair; plant roots and wilting flowers; built up and sliced through black masses; and a flailing puppet who comes to a sticky end, Leather, is an animation by London-based artist Chris Smith. A video accompanies the track from post-punk band Sauna Youth’s 2015 album, Distractions, Leather took years of drawing, testing and animating, and has been released with Deaths, the final part of their trilogy of LPs. “It grew from a very rough three-second version of the haircut sequence” Chris says. “I developed the character of the scissors and the theme of cutting as a destructive act. The scissors are a malevolent and disruptive presence, although you could say that they create as well as destroy, but it’s not a happy ending for the puppet.”","Last Friday South-London based band, The Honey Hahs released their first record Dear Someone, Happy Something. It’s a very sweet record, gentle, happy and joyful and is the result of Sylvie (11), Robin (12) and Rowan’s (16) joint and solo songwriting.","At Nicer Tuesdays August we had the absolute honour of revealing a new project by photographer Luke Evans. A firm long-time favourite of ours Luke took to the stage at Oval Space to introduce his work to those who may not of known him, but they definitely love him now.","Swedish-based duo Amanda Berglund and Erik Kirtley have been collaborating for almost a decade on their graphic design and illustration practices. Currently, the studio is working on a variety of projects including a community-based project designing vinyl wrap design for a mini-van, this will function as a mobile youth centre in a nearby rural municipality. Amanda & Erik spoke to It’s Nice That about their vibrant design practice, discussing two, recent print-based projects that showcase the studio’s intellect and innovation.","Permission Slip, the latest show at Glasgow’s Good Press, is an exhibition of works by Landfill Editions’ Hugh Frost and artist Sean Roy Parker; who describes the show as being about “the debris of art-making, the capturing of waste thoughts or materials, and how they can become the scaffolding for one’s practice”.","Before Buffalo, fashion stylists were considered dressers, not artists in their own right. Enter Ray Petri, and the ‘80s youth culture movement he spearheaded together with photographer Jamie Morgan. Together, with the help of a tribe which included Mitzi Lorenz, the Kamen brothers, Mark Lebon, Cameron McVey, the duo blended together art, fashion, photography and music, shaking up London’s subcultural scene from grassroots to high fashion and elevating styling into an art form. Pairing kilts with MA-1 flight jackets and Armani suits with Dr Martens, stylist Ray Petri created genre-defying looks that still possess a punk sensibility over 30 years on.","Charlotte Mei is an illustrator and artist known for wearing various creative hats. Some fans adore her ceramics or attend her classes; brand art directors commission her illustrations; and a variety of international mags are often filled with original Mei’s. Her working process is one that varies in terms of application and point of view, and she took the Nicer Tuesdays audience through how she gets it done at the August event.","As a graphic designer and custom type designer, Kia has worked with the likes of Nike, Christie’s and Vanity Fair. His type designs are original and contemporary, embodying the distinct personality of each client while maintaining a sense of Kia’s effortlessly quirky style.","One of my favourite ways to procrastinate is – somewhat ironically – to read about other people’s models for productivity and achievement; and It’s Nice That alum Emily Gosling’s new book, Great Minds Don’t Think Alike, provides ample opportunity for taking time out to learn about how some of our great creative minds get their creative juices going.","A little over a year ago, Chris Glickman, who was working for Totokaelo at the time, met Isaac Friedman-Heiman who had come in to consult for the clothing retailer. “The project there didn’t really end up going anywhere, but we enjoyed working together, had different backgrounds and areas of expertise, which began our conversation about starting a small studio of our own,” Chris tells It’s Nice That.","Varoom magazine is renowned as a hub of discussion for the illustration community, and an advocate for innovative approaches to the practice. Its new editor, Olivia Ahmad, describes the intention for each issue as being \"[to convey] a live reflection of what is happening in illustration at any given moment… presenting new work and giving insight into how it’s done, but also asking questions about it – why make it? – what does it mean to people?” Bringing her experience as curator at the House of Illustration, her appreciation for contemporary practices in illustration is underpinned by historical knowledge, which will have no doubt informed the latest issue.","For Found in Adobe Stock, It’s Nice That has commissioned two creatives to explore the world of Adobe Stock’s 3D collection to make a series of works using their individual discoveries. Starting from the same jumping off point, the project follows the journey each creative took as their paths diverged into the strange and wondrous depths of the huge collection, and how they used what they found to make beautiful and hypnotic final pieces.","Journalist and filmmaker Roxy Rezvany began her Nicer Tuesdays talk last month by explaining her creative journey. Roxy grew up “loving art and stories and films but I never went to film school,” she says.

Providing creative support from ages 5 to 85, Project Ability encourages artistic expression and allows budding creatives to realise their potential.","Looking for an escape from the realities of life under Soviet rule, thousands of Estonians swapped Eastern Europe for Canada. The post-war world was remapped by these patterns of mass emigration, and the second half of the twentieth century is, in many ways, a story of cultural crossover.","Artist Alon Bonder found his way into graphic design and illustration via the same route as many ’90s teens: skateboarding. “The first time I became interested in any graphic design was when I started skateboarding at the age of 13,” the Tel Avivian explains. “I was always looking at the graphics of the boards and was attracted by the pop art style of illustration and the clear anti-establishment message. Later on, I began to go to local punk shows through which I discovered a culture of DIY and independent design, such as show flyers, record covers, zines and so on. Subsequently, I started making a lot of photo collages and sketches in my sketchbook.”","Founded 15 years ago by Kirsty Carter and Emma Thomas, the London-based graphic design studio, A Practice for Everyday Life, has carved an international reputation for its outstanding, collaborative work with conceptual rigour.

But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings.

That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing. In addition, Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices.","Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for \"some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.\"","Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details.","The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people.

The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","\"For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,\" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. \"I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy.

But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized \"the right to be forgotten,\" allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","\"The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,\" said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking \"I Agree.\" The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to \"bracket off\" European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.","\"Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,\" she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. \"We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,\" it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","\"Cambridge Analytica's story sounds like a spy novel,\" he said. \"It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,\" he said. \"We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

BREXIT! TRUMP! RUSSIANS! The latest big\nGuardian/Observer expose seems to have it all. But do we need to worry about\ntargeting advertising? What is wrong here anyway?","I thought I’d put the stream of MPs (the Commons Digital,\nCulture, Media and Sport Committee) questioning Christopher Wylie on in the\nbackground today. I ended up watching it to the end. He seems to be a\nknowledgeable and eloquent young man who knows much about the new political\nfrontline of social media campaigning and advertising.","It’s unlikely that data-led targeting can be put back\ninto a box, even if we wanted it to. And our data is probably going to get\nleaked or stolen—it probably already has. We all need to understand this brave\nnew world of targeted advertising and political messaging. But is targeted\nadvertising and messaging really anything new?","Data theft?","The core activity that appears to be wrong and possibly\nillegal is that Cambridge Analytica (CA – shorthand for the various affiliated\ndata companies involved) used information that was taken from Facebook on the\nbasis that it would be used only for academic research, but which was then\ndiverted for other (political and money-making) purposes. Eventually we’ll get\na judgment about whether the academics, business managers or Facebook (or all\nthe above) did anything illegal.","As individuals our data may be out there, but there have\nbeen numerous data breaches and this one probably isn’t that much more\ntroubling than other ones. What other issues does the case raise? Well the CA people\ncome across like a bunch of shits (wanting to make money at the expense of\ndemocratic ideals) but there are unscrupulous people all over the place, so we\nneedn’t focus on that either.","Campaign overspending?","A major issue for the MPs is no doubt one of election\nspending breaches. One line is that the leave campaigns could breach spending\nlimits, certainly a significant issue. (The fact that there were numerous leave\ncampaigns also had the advantage of being able to put out different and\ncontradictory statements about post-EU Britain). Hopefully this will be\nproperly investigated but the electoral commission and its equivalent bodies\nabroad.","A further related concern raised by Wylie was that CA\ncould have been used to get around spending rules in other ways. The owner is\nsuper-right-wing rich guy Robert Mercer, who could offer subsidised (or free)\nassistance to causes and candidates he supports.","Russian interference?","If CA are as effective as they claim then this would have\nhad a major impact on recent elections and a certain referendum. What has any\nof this got to do with Russians? The links are perhaps tenuous, though they\nwill hopefully be investigated. Firstly, Russia is against Western unity and so\nclearly supports movements (populism, fascism and left-wing) that seek to\nundermine institutions such as the EU and internationalist politicians such as\nHilary Clinton. Russia is a gangster state so can’t compete with the West\neconomically, but the thugs can stay in power if they don’t fall too far behind\nthe rest of the world. They could raise their people up but it’s cheaper to try\nto bring the West down by interfering in our democracies.","These are serious issues, but not that revelatory and are\nlargely matters for the law or regulators.","Targeting?","What will trouble people is the issue mentioned above:\ntargeted messaging/advertising. But is targeted advertising anything new?\nRetailers target their customers and politicians target their electorates in\nways they think will be likely to elicit a response and most people don’t find\nthis immoral or something that should be outlawed.","I think what is particularly concerning about the\ntargeted messaging is that it is less open to scrutiny and challenge. If\npeople’s online lives are increasingly cut-off then their messages aren’t as\nlikely to be challenged. Political debate is debased and polarised. Echo\nchambers and silos abound online.","Public discourse","If untrue or morally questionable campaign literature or\nadvertising is posted through a door, then it might get publicised through the\nmedia. People still talk about the awful racist anti-labour materials used in\nthe West Midlands in the 1960s, though most won’t have seen it. Those involved,\nor their parties, can be held to account whether legally or reputationally.","However, if online material of unknown source is focused\non those who are likely to fall for it then sceptics may not get a chance to\nchallenge it. Untruths can spread quickly online. Furthermore, no-one can be\nheld to account as its anonymous. So, the mechanism which might cause people to\nhold-back on bad behaviour won’t apply online.","Campaign spending irregularities and the spreading of\nfalsehoods for political gain are longstanding concerns. However, these issues\nbecome turbocharged in the age of social media.","Has unfair or immoral campaigning given us the wrong\nelection results? Only if people have been duped into voting the wrong way. Its\ncertainly plausible but very difficult to prove, depending whether CA are as\neffective as they claim to be.","Either way, we all have a duty (and a personal interest)\nin making sure we aren’t fooled by those seeking to manipulate us. This gets\nharder as more is learned more about what pushes people’s buttons and about\nwhat buttons each person has. We must all make sure we aren’t turned into a\nsucker.","No comments:","Post a Comment","Political philosophy and public policy tutor/writer/researcher.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.","On March 17, reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London suggested Trump-campaign linked UK-based political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, had been able to buy data on 50 million Facebook users in 2015 to use for microtarging political advertising.","The data had been gathered via a third party survey app running on Facebook’s platform and using its API to pull data on the friends of the 270,000 respondents who answered the survey.","At the weekend Facebook took out full page newspaper ads in the US and UK apologizing for failing to protect users’ information.","Billions have been wiped off the company’s share price since the scandal broke.","The company’s share price also fell more than 5% today, on the news of the FTC announcement.","The consumer watchdog previously investigated Facebook over deceptive privacy claims, back in 2011.","And in 2012, as part of an FTC settlement, Facebook promised it would give users “clear and prominent notice” and get their consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.","It also agree to two decades of biennial audits.","Facebook avoided a financial penalty at the time, though if the FTC goes on to decide the company violated that earlier initial agreement it could certainly be on the hook for fines — fines which the Washington Post has suggested could scale to trillions of dollars if the FTC’s $40,000 per privacy violation is multiplied by the 50M Facebook users whose data was passed to Cambridge Analytica.","Whatever any eventual financial penalty might be, the reputational damage Facebook is suffering as a result of this snowballing data handling scandal is bad enough, adding to calls for policymakers to regulate social media platforms.","We’ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the FTC’s announcement — at the time of writing the company had not responded.","*DISCLAIMER - What sets us apart from other online business opportunities is our world class system and methods, as well as our integrity - so we want you to know exactly where you stand.

The result could be a hearing that exposes both of those tech giants – whose data is not known to have been taken by Cambridge Analytica – to uncomfortable questions about the extent to which they profit from their users’ most personal data, too.","A spokesman for Zuckerberg, who last week expressed his openness to appear at a hearing, said Facebook is still reviewing the request. A spokeswoman for Twitter declined comment. Spokespeople for Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The Senate’s upcoming hearing is hardly the only major political and legal challenge facing Facebook. Earlier Monday, a powerful U.S. watchdog agency, the Federal Trade Commission, said it would investigate Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica incident. The news initially sent Facebook’s stock price tumbling, though it reversed those losses by the end of the day as the market surged.","For the U.S. government, a key question is whether Facebook's business practices violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over another privacy mishap. As a result, the new probe carries the potential for steep fines and other penalties on the social giant, which is facing similar investigations in Europe.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” Tom Pahl, the acting director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement Monday. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","For its part, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Friday that it had obtained data from the social network “in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws.\"","On Capitol Hill, lawmakers on two panels -- the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee – already have invited Zuckerberg to testify at two upcoming hearings. But lawmakers have not indicated if they would seek to subpoena the Facebook executive if he declined to attend or sought to send another company official in his place.","The Senate Judiciary Committee panel, however, could prove to be the toughest political territory for Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers. Lawmakers there have been seething over Facebook, Google and Twitter since last fall, when the panel grilled those tech giants’ lawyers about another issue – Russian propaganda that spread on their platforms around the 2016 election.","Questions about Trump, the Russian government’s disinformation efforts and the presidential race are likely to return at the scheduled April 10 session – on top of new, uncomfortable queries about the ways that the biggest brands in the tech industry collect and protect information about their users. Some of the Judiciary Committee’s members, including Republican Sen. John Kennedy (La.) and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), are regular critics of the tech industry’s privacy practices.","On Monday, Blumenthal said that federal officials investigating Facebook should be “penetrating and prompt in holding [it] accountable for apparent illegal action.” He even suggested in a statement that “possible remedies should include damage payments to users, and other court-ordered action.”","For now, the Senate Judiciary Committee session is set to “broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” the committee announced Monday. “It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Tony RommTony Romm is a technology policy reporter at The Washington Post.

Only one jumped at the chance.","text":["Tech","Clinton and Trump were both offered data from Facebook. Only one jumped at the chance.","LANCE ULANOFFOct 10, 2017","Why did Hillary Clinton lose the election?","There are numerous reasons fair game for finger-pointing, but to truly leverage any of those elements required data and know-how. Russia clearly used both to help influence an election. They and others may have used that knowledge to spread fake news.","One of the best catalysts for spreading the message — fake or otherwise — and reaching voters at the heart of their concerns was Facebook, which was right there with the campaigns, trying to help. But did one campaign accept more help than other other and, in doing so, help to sabotage their own presidential aspirations?","Reaching heartland voters on the topics they cared about, like infrastructure, required a Ph.D. in social media, data mechanics tools, and ad delivery. It's in that last department — getting ads in front of the right eyeballs — where the Clinton campaign may have lost its edge, at least according to one member of the team that helped Donald Trump take the White House.","Trump Campaign Digital Director Brad Parscale told 60 Minutes this week that when he emailed Facebook asking for “every single secret button, click, technology you have,” the social network agreed to send its staffers to sit with the Trump campaign advertising and data operation. This quality time reportedly happened as frequently as five days a week.","According to Parscale, the Clinton campaign was offered a similar set of embeds and turned them down.","In a single day, Parscale’s operation averaged 50,000-to-60,000 ads a day. He claims he was even able to choose the individual Facebook employees who would work with his operation based on whether they leaned Republican or Democrat. (He says he chose all Republicans, naturally.)","It was Parscale’s job to make the ads and figure out what was going to make people react, but his data game was certainly strengthened by Facebook employees who sat next to him explaining exactly how to use their tools to make that happen.","Parscale's assertions to 60 Minutes that the Facebook employees worked with him full-time, and the more explosive claim that they let him hand-pick embeds by political affiliation, don't hold up. From the post:","\"The campaigns did not get to 'hand pick' the people who worked with them from Facebook. And no one from Facebook was assigned full-time to the Trump campaign, or full-time to the Clinton campaign. Both campaigns approached things differently and used different amounts of support.\"","Facebook's comments mirror those of Twitter, which offered similar help to both campaigns:","Twitter provides nonpartisan ad sales resources to advertisers around the world, helping them use our ad sales platform efficiently. In 2016 we offered such resources to both the Clinton and Trump campaigns, as well as gubernatorial and Senate races across both parties.\"","One thing is clear from Facebook's response. One camp, either Trump or Clinton, didn't take as much advantage of Facebook was offering. Based on what Parscale claims — and considering he's already been caught in at least one possible lie, we have to take it all with a grain of salt — it wasn't the Trump camp. His campaign sounded especially eager to tap into the power of Facebook's ad-targeting tools.","What's also unclear is the extent to which Facebook's assistance actually helped.","At least at the start of the campaign, Clinton and Trump were on a level playing field. Both campaigns had data operations. Clinton reportedly built her own.","“I was very proud of my data and analytics team. They were largely veterans of the Obama campaigns, ’08, ’12, and then we brought in new people and brought in a lot of new expertise to build the next generation,” she told Walt Mossberg at this year’s Code Conference.","In reality, however, her data game wasn’t nearly as strong as what was coming out of the Trump campaign.","Clinton contends that Cambridge Analytica played a role here and essentially handed Trump’s team even more powerful data and personality-based targeting tools.","Clinton said she was aware that “the other side” had content farms and was using them to deliver “false content… in a very personalized way, both sort of above the radar and below.\" She also knew that a lot of this false information and news about her was flowing through Facebook.","Not helping matters was the Democratic National Committee, which was in bad shape. “I mean it was bankrupt, it was on the verge of insolvency, its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong,” she told Recode's Walt Mossberg. And so there was no data operation for Clinton to inherit.","Suffice to say Clinton had no confidence in the DNC’s data game, and she was worried about the powerful Republican data operation and its potential to impact voters via platforms like Facebook. Did that spur her to lean on Facebook's team as Parscale claims he did? There's no clear answer here, and we may never know.","But if Clinton had won, it's quite possible it would have been her digital director extolling the virtues of Facebook's ad tools on 60 Minutes.","Parscale painted a compelling picture for 60 minutes of how good those Facebook tools are for crafting and recrafting messages until you trigger the right response. The same issue ad, for instance, could be served thousands of times with slightly different art, colors, text. It could also deliver ads focusing on different topics to people living next door to each other. Imagine the impact this might have on gerrymandered swing states where you can map an issue to align with known voting blocks (gerrymandering tends to group people of certain party affiliations and ideologies).","Clinton's team probably didn't take the same kind of advantage of those tools, but the disparity between Clinton and Trump's approach in this area may have been one of degrees.","With so many factors at play and the scope of Russian interference in the election still being discovered, it’s hard to point to how Clinton campaign used or didn't use Facebook embeds as a singular contributing factor in her loss, but it’s also hard to deny that it didn’t have some impact.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

{"originalurl":"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/combine-audiences-facebook-adwords/244693/","title":"4 Ways to Combine Audiences Across Facebook & AdWords","text":["4 Ways to Combine Audiences Across Facebook & AdWords","One of the greatest strengths of Google AdWords lies in the ability to combine keyword targeting with audience data (RLSAs), while Facebook is the don when it comes to the demographic information they provide advertisers as part of their core targeting options.","This post will outline how you can transfer your top performing Facebook audiences over to AdWords as RLSAs, and discuss four simple tactics to combine Facebook audiences with RLSAs that will allow you to refine your targeting to leverage budget and maximize return on ad spend (ROAS).","The Power of Facebook Audience Targeting","Facebook’s user base is huge. In Q4 2017 Facebook reported over 2.13 billion monthly active Facebook users, which is a 14 percent increase and represents over a third of the entire population on the planet!","The targeting options available for advertisers to reach this huge market on Facebook can be broadly split into three streams:","Core audiences are Facebook’s base targeting options for advertisers. The options available at this level include demographic, location, interest, and behavioral targeting.","Custom audiences refer to audiences created through existing website and audience data. These audiences can be created via Facebook Pixel (website tracking code) or by importing your own contact lists (email addresses or phone numbers) much like Google customer match.","Lookalike audiences enable advertisers to find people who share similar characteristics (job titles, page likes/follows, demographics) to their existing customers. Much like Google’s similar audience feature, this is a great option for expanding reach if you’re maxing out the reach of your existing customer lists.","The real power of Facebook, however, lies in the sheer volume of their user base and the data they have available on those users.","The personal data Facebook has on its users is way over and above what Google is able to offer.","While Google knows the sites people have visited and which keywords they’ve used to get there, Facebook has detailed data on their users’ job titles, age, hobbies, interests, likes, friends, and more – all of which can be used by advertisers to target their campaigns.","Combining Search & Social Audiences","Layering social audience data on search campaigns can be an extremely effective method of improving the performance of your search campaigns.","By priming users with messaging on social you can then serve highly relevant ads when those users eventually carry out a keyword-based search on Google, delivering the ultimate knockout punch!","The data around combining search and social is certainly encouraging. A recent Kenshoo study showed that paid search audiences which were already exposed to Facebook advertising generated a 30 percent improvement in return on ad spend and a 7 percent uplift in CTR.","How to Transfer Facebook Audiences to AdWords","Many of the tactics contained in this post rely on transferring data collected from Facebook and using it to create RLSAs for use on Google search.","All you need to do in order to capture this data is ensure you’re using unique UTM tags in each ad set of your Facebook campaigns.","The more specific you are with your UTMs, the more granular you’ll be able to get with your audience segmentation.","Once you start generating traffic through these UTM tagged URLs, you’ll be able to segment this traffic in Google Analytics’ audience builder.","One thing to bear in mind is that any audience list you create must contain a minimum of 1,000 users to be eligible for use on the Google search network.","1. Target B2B Decision-Makers (Job Titles) via Your Search Ads","One tactic we’ve been using recently with a few clients is targeting job title data to filter out B2B decision-makers on Facebook before using this list (once users have visited your website) to target ads only at these individuals on Google search.","Tag the campaign using unique UTM tags so you can segment the traffic in GA.","Create a new audience definition in Google Analytics by filtering out this traffic using the campaign UTMs you applied on Facebook.","Apply this audience list as target and bid on your Google AdWords search campaigns to ensure only the decision-makers who have been reached by your ad on Facebook see the ad.","This tactic ensures that the clicks you pay for on AdWords are targeted at B2B decision-makers, handy for advertisers who want to squeeze the most out of a smaller budget.","While this will obviously limit reach for smaller advertisers, it will ensure that any budget spent is only being used to target qualified leads based on the demographic information gathered from Facebook.","2. Uncover New Prospects on Facebook to Target TOFU Keywords","Lookalike audiences on Facebook are a great tactic for finding new potential customers who share similar characteristics to your existing customer list.","This is an ideal tactic for advertisers who feel like they have exhausted the current search demand in their industry.","It will make new users consider your product or service on social, bringing them into your funnel and then pushing them further down the funnel whenever they search for a related informational keyword.","Specifically, I would recommend using Facebook lookalike audiences to uncover and target new potential customers with awareness ads on Facebook, making them take note of your product or service.","To do this, you first need to create a new campaign targeting a lookalike of one of your existing audiences.","In the example below, we have used a lookalike of the existing page likes, but you can create lookalikes from customer lists and website audience data, too.","Once this audience has been primed with ads related to your products and services, it’s likely they’ll begin searching for information around the products or services you’ve been advertising.","This is where you need to be prepared with your search ads.","To do this, you’d need to research the phrases these individuals may be using to search for information related to your product or service by using a tool, such as AnswerthePublic.","Once you have this data, set up a new campaign containing these very top of the funnel (TOFU) keywords and apply the Facebook audience list (transferred over via UTMs and segmented in Google Analytics) as target and bid to ensure that only the brand new users who have clicked through from your awareness ads will be eligible to see this campaign.","3. Use Partner Categories Across Facebook & AdWords","These categories allow advertisers to further refine their targeting based on information compiled by these partners, such as offline demographic and behavioral information like homeownership or purchase history.","As an example, any advertisers who utilize a data profiling service such as Experian Mosaic will now be able to target customers who fit within their target customer segments on Facebook.","If you’re using the services provided by one of these new Facebook data partners, you’ll be able to target these categories through Facebook by selecting “Partner categories by request” in the detailed targeting drop down and finding the relevant customer segment.","In the example below, we’re able to target a specific customer segment called “City prosperity” based on data profiling carried out by a third-party provider.","In much the same way as the earlier examples, you can then tag each ad set using UTMs and create RLSAs for AdWords off the back of this.","In this scenario, you should use the list you’ve created to increase bids on your existing search campaigns for anyone searching Google who’s part of your target customer group – they share similar characteristics to your existing customer base and will be more likely to convert!","4. Use Gmail Ads & Facebook Ads Together","Both Google and Facebook allow advertisers to upload customer data and run ad campaigns at these users when they’re logged into Gmail (using Gmail Ads) or Facebook.","To maximize the return across both networks you should be smart about how you set up the targeting on your GSP and Facebook campaigns.","If you’re running the same campaign across Gmail and Facebook, you should create two Facebook Ad sets and set higher bids in the ad set for people on your mailing list who are Gmail users.","This tactic is an effective way of maximizing your budget on Facebook and ensuring more of your budget is used on the audience you know has likely been primed by your message already.","The Results","We’ve been testing these tactics and more with a range of advertisers recently and have seen some really impressive results through the RLSAs created by layering Facebook audience data.","This data has been gathered from a sample of 20 accounts in our AdWords MCC over a 6 month period, some accounts operating in highly competitive industries.","For the campaigns we’ve been running with Facebook audience RLSAs vs. standard website audience RLSAs we have seen:","A 68 percent increase in CTR.","A 66 percent increase in conversion rate.","An 18 percent reduction in CPA.","A Few Things to Bear in Mind","Bid stacking on AdWords: Remember that any bid modifiers placed through RLSAs will stack on top of existing modifiers such as time of day, day of week, device etc.","Minimum list size: The minimum number of users a list must contain to be eligible for use on Google search is 1,000, so you can’t be too specific if you have a low traffic site.","Conclusion","The broader strategy here is to build awareness on social media before ensuring your paid search campaigns are ready to act on any intent shown by these new prospects on Google search.","The tactics I’ve presented are just a few specific examples of how you can use the granular targeting options available to you on Facebook and use it to cross-pollinate your paid search activity over on Google AdWords."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

(US Naval War College)","Facebook is defending its decision to shut down the page of a major Palestinian news outlet, describing the action as a move against “hate speech.”","On Saturday, the social media giant closed without warning the page of the Safa Palestinian Press Agency, which had 1.3 million followers, as well as Safa’s account on the photo sharing site Instagram.","On Tuesday, the Palestinian Media Association condemned Facebook’s widening assault on the free speech of Palestinian journalists, calling it “clear submission to the policies and dictates of the Israeli occupation which is pursuing Palestinian activists on the basis of their political views and intellectual positions and issuing prison sentences against them.”","But Facebook is justifying the removal of Safa’s account. “This page was correctly removed for violating our community standards,” a company spokesperson emailed The Electronic Intifada Monday evening. “There is no room for hate speech or incitement of violence on our platform.”","The spokesperson provided no evidence to back up the company’s accusations against Safa, but asserted, “We care about the voices, opinion and rights of all the different communities on Facebook; however, keeping our community safe is our priority.”","By referring to “hate speech” and “incitement” as justifications to silence journalists, Facebook has adopted the framework of Israel, which routinely uses such broad and ill-defined terms to describe virtually all criticism of its violent military occupation over Palestinians or of its state ideology, Zionism.","The company did not respond to a question about whether it had taken the action against Safa based on a request from Israel.","“Eagerness”","The Intercept’s Glenn Greenwald has previously written and spoken about Facebook’s collusion with Israel and the United States to silence voices they don’t like.","“Facebook has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness – at times bordering on eagerness – to curry favor with powerful governments by deleting content that they dislike,” Greenwald told The Electronic Intifada on Tuesday.","“One of the countries to which Facebook has proven itself most subservient is the Israeli government, and as a result, it has engaged in a year-long censorship spree against Palestinians whose crime is that they express views and engage in activism that Israeli officials dislike.”","According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Facebook’s latest crackdown on Palestinian journalists and activists began several weeks ago, after Israeli occupation forces extrajudicially executed Ahmad Nasser Jarrar, a man Israel claims was involved in the shooting death of an Israeli settler in early January.","Israeli lawmakers also discussed how to suppress online content, including getting Facebook to take down images of Jarrar.","Since the beginning of the year, Haaretz says, citing an unnamed Palestinian activist who monitors the issue, about 500 Facebook pages of Palestinian activists and journalists have been closed by the company.","Wide-ranging coverage","According to Haaretz, Safa has been operating for a decade as a “Hamas-affiliated” counterpart to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency that is controlled by the Palestinian Authority and the Fatah faction led by Mahmoud Abbas.","But Safa’s website shows that its reporting is fairly typical of a wide range of Palestinian media outlets, covering violence by Israeli occupation forces against Palestinians, local, regional and international politics, and human interest stories.","The outlet carries reports on the activities of all political factions. On Tuesday, for instance, one of its lead stories was on a cabinet meeting led by Rami Hamdallah, the PA prime minister, in which Hamdallah asserted that his government “will not abandon our people in Gaza.”","The report includes the PA’s claims about the achievements of its efforts in Gaza, such as bringing together 55 countries at a donors conference last week to fund a $565 million water desalination plant in the Israeli-blockaded coastal territory.","Another report Tuesday carries a statement by Abbas’ official spokesperson describing recent US decisions to cut aid to the PA as “a war on our people.”","Obeying censorship","Palestinians are avid users of Facebook and it is often a primary source of information about what is happening in their communities.","But social media has made it hard for Israel’s censors to control information flowing from and to Palestinians under their military rule.","Last week, an Israeli military court sentenced Palestinian teenager Ahed Tamimi to eight months in prison for slapping a heavily armed occupation soldier in the West Bank.","This is beyond disgusting. Zuckerberg/Facebook willing to sabotage the rights of American citizens to say and read what they wish on one of the most important issues of our time. And at the bidding of a foreign government. THIS is treason. He and Facebook are now agents of a foreign government undermining the Constitutional rights of American citizens as well as silencing the voices of those whose illegal and brutal oppression by Israel our government is subsidizing and protecting. And anyone who criticizes him will probably be called an anti-semite. Or a self-hating Jew when appropriate.","I would like to know how I can express my objections to Facebook's actions directly to Facebook. The message that I want to send is to permit all Palestinian Arab support pages and messages, and remove all Israeli support messages for many reasons, including however that Israel is an apartheid state.","Just deleted my facebook account and messenger too. Noticed that it does not seem to be a trustworthy application. Zuckenberg will probably be ducking many country's request to question Mark. He has probably has broken privacy laws in quite a few countries. The looming fines and possible jail time are evidence of Mark Zuckenberg's abusing peoples data.","I am angry and frustrated at the inability of justice to prevail when an organization like Facebook takes unjustified action to cut off communication to those already suffering under the occupation. What is even more frustrating is there is nothing I or an ordinary person can do to stop this outrageous practice.","A wonder, that people still use FaceBook - it's convenient, but you become their product and you sell your soul to the devil (you know, what I mean - I do not believe in gods nor devils - I only meet humans of that kind).","A wonder, that buying oranges, people only go for low price - boycott Israeli products.","The hate speech is inappropriate as a kind of demagogy. Demagogy may be both pro-Palestinian and anti-Palestinian, pro-Israelian and anti-Israelian. Otherwise, all the four kinds of those views themselves must not be obstacled, if expressed juridical or politcal way."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

It might be a wake-up call. - The Washington Post","text":["Here’s how to download all your data from Facebook. It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information. According to Facebook, that download might also include the “unique number” Facebook assigns to you for facial recognition purposes, based on the photos you’ve been tagged in on the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

Cambridge Analytica, which is largely owned by reclusive billionaire and Trump-backer Robert Mercer, had – until recently – boasted that it had Steve Bannon and other key members of the Trump team on its Board of Directors or Advisory Board. Financial documents released by the White House disclosed that Bannon, Trump’s “strategic advisor,” had received a six-figure consulting fee from Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 campaign.","Now that Trump and Bannon have moved into the White House, Bannon has taken a lower-profile role in Cambridge Analytica’s efforts to win a strategically important contract with the U.S. State Department and to market its services to other federal agencies. Meanwhile, the acting Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”) at the Republican National Convention, Darren Bolding, has become Analytica’s CTO after Trump’s election.","Disgraced former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn also has been taking an active role in marketing CA’s services to the Pentagon and other U.S. agencies. However, increasingly loud rumors that the investigation of Flynn is rapidly headed towards an indictment has undercut his marketing usefulness to CA.\nThe London-based SCL Group Ltd, which is the parent company for Cambridge Analytica, recently won the contract with a branch of the U.S. State Department known as the “Global Engagement Center.” SCL Group’s purported mission under this contract is to use its psychological profiling and data manipulation techniques as part of a “counter-radicalization” campaign directed at young men in other countries who may be thinking of joining ISIS. However, since Congress has largely eliminated the barriers between access to data profiles of foreign nationals and U.S. citizens, it is likely that Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group will have access to personal data relating to millions of Americans, along with the data on non-Americans. This factor, combined with the fact that the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and other U.S.-government information outlets are no longer restricted by U.S. statutes to broadcasting their message only outside the U.S., the Trump Administration – through the SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica, and both government-controlled and “friendly” privately held news outlets — will be in a position to mount a robust propaganda and psychological manipulation campaign targeting Americans. As presently planned, this permanent and continuous campaign will use social media platforms and cyberspace, as well as more traditional “news” and information outlets, to get the Administration’s “message” out.\nIn addition to the State Department, the SCL Group is pursuing contracts with at least a dozen other federal agencies, including the Commerce Department, Homeland Security, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. As part of its “pitch,” SCL holds itself out as having access to thousands of “data points” about every American man, woman, and child, as well as a massive database on foreign nationals. SCL then explains tothe potential clients that it can use these data points to formulate a “psychographic” profile of every American (as well as every potential domestic or foreign terrorist). The profile can then be used to craft an individually-designed “message,” to influence (read “manipulate”) that person into acting (or voting) in the desired matter.\nSCL and Cambridge Analytica also correctly claim that they had a significant impact on the successful Brexit campaign, although this credential has been somewhat tarnished as of late since British authorities are continuing to investigate whether SCL violated British and EU privacy laws in their rush to use personal psychological data to influence voters there.\nThe FBI’s ongoing investigation of the role that CA and SCL played in coordinating the Russian/Trump Campaign’s cyber and disinformation efforts does not appear to have had any “chilling effect” on the marketing campaigns by these two companies to secure additional federal government contracts. To be sure, CA and SCL have powerful allies within the White House, and with the main Mercer-backed operatives in position throughout the Trump Administration, these two companies are extremely “bullish” on their prospects to win additional federal contracts, despite the persistent questioning by FBI investigators.","It has been reported that Nigel Oakes of the SCL Group, along with Kristen Fonternrose, a former State Department official who recently joined the company, have been actively expoiting their many contacts in Washington as part of their aggressive marketing efforts. For example, these two recently paid a visit to the Pentagon to meet with Dr. Hriar Cabayan, head of the Department of Defense’s Strategic Multilayer Assessment branch, which is the “psych-ops” center providing “behavioral research and cultural analysis” for U.S. military operations. When asked about the meeting, Dr. Cabayan reported that “they were in town and just dropped in to say hello.”\nThe SCL Group landed its first major deal in 1999, with the goal of enhancing the reputation of then-Indonesian president Abdurrahman Wahid. SCL set out to influence behavior by identifying key audiences within Indonesia and then developing strategies to give them a more favorable view of the Indonesian President. SCL’s Jakarta “ops center” spared no expense, looking more like a NASA space launch control room than a psych-ops center. It contained a 12-screen media feed; a 4/3m LED presenter video wall, 62 computer screens, a large 6.4 rear-projected screen, plus a large 10x4m operations overview screen.","SCL soon developed the dubious reputation for its expertise in influencing voting patterns by appealing to voter prejudice. In 2006, SCL ran a campaign in Latvia intended to exploit the fears and prejudices that many Latvians had for ethnic Russians living in Latvia, who were blamed – mostly unfairly — for unemployment and other economic problems that ordinary Latvians were experiencing.","According to Bloomberg News, SCL, which promoted itself as a high-tech, cutting-edge solution provider in election campaigns worldwide, was not above using low-tech and dirty tricks campaigns to give their political clients an advantage. For example, it was reported that SCL used a “street media” graffiti campaign in the Caribbean country of Trinidad, making it look like young locals had spontaneously expressed their support for the favored client, the United National Congress.","SCL also helped the St. Lucian government in the Caribbean, and participated in Nigeria’s notoriously corrupt 2007 election, which international observers found was marred by ballot stuffing, falsified votes, and censorship of opposition viewpoints. SCL’s website also represented that it had helped the ruling People’s Democratic Party discourage opposition supporters from voting by organizing “anti-poll rallies” on the day of the election, although SCL later re-worded this description of its election day efforts without explanation. SCL also later issued a statement denying that it had ever participated in voter suppression or other efforts “to undermine the democratic processes.”","Cambridge Analytica was formed in 2013 as a small U.S. offshoot of the SCL Group. CA personnel initially worked on Senator Ted Cruz’s campaign, but after Cruz folded his tent, they moved over to the Trump Campaign, thanks in large measure to the support CA received from Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort. At the time, Manafort was Trump’s Campaign Chairman and close associate of SCL part-owner Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch and billionaire with close ties to Vladimir Putin and Russia’s natural gas giant, Gazprom. Firtash is under indictment on various federal charges by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). Tthe efforts to extradite him to the U.S. from Vienna seem to have stalled since Trump’s election, despite the fact that an Austrian appeals court recently reversed a lower court and ruled in favor of the U.S.’s extradition request.","Firtash, who has extensive ties with Russian intelligence operatives, is believed to have critical information on the coordination between Russian intelligence and the Trump Campaign at several levels, including the parallel Russian/CA cyber attacks. But it does not appear that Attorney General Jeff Sessions or anyone else in the Trump Administration is anxious to make a deal with Firtash on the criminal charges pending against him in return for information on Russia’s meddling in the 2016 Presidential election. Sessions has “recused” himself from the investigation; however, all indications are that he and his political operatives within the Justice Department are now trying their best to assure that Firtash remains in Vienna and remains silent.","Mercer, CA’s majority shareholder, invested at least $10 million in the Company after he was impressed with the work that CA had done for his friend, L. Brent Bozell III, a Tea Party sympathizer and founder of the Media Research Center, which goal was “to neutralize leftwing bias in the news media and popular culture.” Mercer was also on friendly terms with British leader Nigel Farage, one of the leading architects of the Leave.EU and its Brexit campaign. Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon, formerly of a Mercer-owned media outlet — Breitbart News — also joined the Board of CA. Trump Advisor Kelly Ann Conway (and author of the “alternative facts” doctrine) also has close Mercer ties.","Even before CA linked up with the Trump Campaign’s cyber-campaign efforts, Russian cyber operatives — who were being directed by the GRU, FSB and other Russian intelligence units — were starting to flood U.S. social media with computer-generated commands, known as “bots.” These bots were linked to pro-Trump or anti-Clinton stories. Most of these links were to “fake news” stories gleaned from Breitbart News, InfoWars or other U.S. right-wing media, or these links were derived from RT (Russia Today), Sputnik News or other Russian “news” sources that are churned out by Russia’s huge propaganda apparatus.\nOne of the most persistent and favored stories used by Russian operatives to mount their electronic attack on Facebook and other social media platforms was about the mythical bevy of underage women that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta kept in a basement of a Democratic-favored pizzeria in Washington, D.C. In fact, while working for the Trump Campaign, General Flynn and his son persisted in giving credence to this nonsensical story. Tragically, the story ended when an impressionable young man from North Carolina drove to Washington to “self-investigate” this story and accidently discharged a round from his rifle at the Comet Ping Pong pizza parlor in the process. Such are the dangers when fake news meets reality.","Another popular disinformation story widely circulated by Russian-triggered “trolls” (computer operators) and their bots targeted the Facebook pages of African Americans, spreading a fake news story quoting Hillary Clinton as referring to black men as “predators.”\nThrough a combination of dirty cyber tricks and high-tech psychological profiling, Cambridge Analytic had an extraordinary run of success during the 2015-2016 Presidential primaries and general election. It first helped Ted Cruz surge to the front of the crowded field of Republican candidates during the primary season. CA’s hyper-targeted messages seemed to make a difference for Cruz in the Iowa Republican primary. In previous elections, two rural voters in Western Iowa would likely see the same or a similar piece of direct mail. Using Cambridge Analytica’s data and messaging strategies, the Cruz campaign was able to send different messages to similar—but not the same—voters. For example, one rural neighbor might be targeted thirty percent religious-tinted messages, twenty percent gun rights messages, and thirty percent of economic ads.","During the 2016 U. S. Presidential campaign, CA’s CEO Alexander Nix claimed to have used “psychographic data models” to target messages to undecided voters on social media. Cambridge Analytica also claimed to have developed and used psychological profiles based on 5,000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters, based in large part on Facebook “likes,” which the company uses to target the deepest emotions of voters, in effect turning social media into a formidable propaganda machine. “Our targeted methods change depending on who you are as an individual,” explained Nix, “not a model representation of an individual.”","CA marketed itself as using “data modeling and psychographic profiling [i.e., classifying people into personality types] to …connect with people in ways that move them to action.” CA’s website also boasted that it used “more than 100 data variables to model target audience groups and predict the behavior of like-minded people.”","Once Cambridge Analytica joined up with the Trump Campaign, the Trump efforts at data manipulation in the social media field started looking remarkably similar to the Russian-backed disinformation campaign targeting American voters in key precincts in battleground states around the country. Professor Jonathan Albright of Elon University described Cambridge Analytica’s data manipulation, analytics and “behavioral communications” during the 2016 Campaign as follows:\nThis is a propaganda machine. It’s targeting people individually to recruit them to an idea. It’s a level of social engineering that I’ve never seen before. They’re capturing people and then keeping them on an emotional leash and never letting them go.","Although Cambridge Analytica did not have enough time to fully implement its cyber-strategy prior to the November 8, 2016 election, its planned and partially implemented voter manipulation efforts on behalf of Trump were far more sophisticated than Russia’s cyber warfare campaign to influence and destabilize the election. To be sure, like the Russians, CA collected data from millions of Facebook and Twitter accounts and then overwhelmed those accounts with links and individually-tailored “issue” messaging that was either highly favorable to Trump or highly critical of Hillary Clinton.","However, Cambridge Analytica added to this “data mining” and messaging mix what its CEO, Alexander Nix, likes to describe as its “secret sauce,” namely, CA’s ability to “weaponize” the dissemination of alt-right and “fake news” by swarms of bots through the use of emotional and psychological manipulation techniques. CA applies certain psychological research techniques developed by academic researchers at the Cambridge University Psychometrics Center to the rough and tumble world of political campaigning. By closely monitoring the Russian cyber campaign directed at key American voters, Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, were able to successfully create noticeable shifts in public opinions in the major battleground states by preying on the emotional and psychological components of tens of thousands of individual voters. While CA’s efforts – while impressive – were probably not enough to swing the election in Trump’s favor by themselves, the lethal combination of CA’s efforts and the parallel cyber and data dumping campaigns by the Russians and Wikileaks may well have tipped the scales decisively in the last few weeks of the 2016 election campaign. The unwitting (to be charitable) efforts of FBI Director James Comey through the release of his October 28, 2016 letter about a “reopening” of the closed Clinton email investigation was just the unexpected icing on the cake.\nOne area of the FBI’s investigation into possible collusion between Cambridge Analytica and the Russian disinformation campaign targeting American voters is that both the Russians and Cambridge Analytica had an uncanny ability to precisely micro-target Facebook users. They could reach into the exact zip codes and precincts where the Trump Campaign (and apparently also the Russians) knew that Trump could get his biggest bang for the buck. Here was where he would be most likely to pick up undecided voters or to energize voters that were leaning his way to get out, go to the polls and vote.\nAs we now know, the Russians successfully hacked into U.S. state databases and obtained detailed demographic profiles of voters in key states and key precincts within those states. Initially, it was feared that the Russians were planning to try to falsify the vote counts in those states. However, the more likely motivation was for the Russian hackers to use this voter data to tailor even more targeted messaging as part of their disinformation campaign. It may well be the Russians passed this data onto the Trump Campaign – via Cambridge Analytica or some other conduit – so that Cambridge Analytica could develop a more targeted social and mass media campaign message.\nThe federal investigation of Russian/Trump Campaign collusion is also looking into the curious question of how the Trump Campaign was able to so quickly exploit WikiLeaks’ data dump of the tens of thousands of pages hacked from the DNC, Clinton Campaign, and John Podesta databases. Literally within hours of some of these public releases by WikiLeaks, starting on July 22, 2016 on the eve of the Democratic National Convention and continuing periodically thereafter, the Trump Campaign was sending micro-targeted bots and messaging to the Facebook, Twitter and other social media accounts of key voters battleground states and precincts. How could Cambridge Analytica and the Trump Campaign be able to digest such a huge mass of data, analyze it, and pick out key “smoking gun” segments of that data for transmission to potential Trump voters so quickly?\nThe answer to that puzzle is that, as government investigators were first postulating and now concluding, there was a high degree of coordination between Trump campaign operatives and Russia/WikiLeaks before the public disclosure of the hacked documents by WikiLeaks. Roger Stone, a key Trump operative, bragged publicly that he was in touch with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks and the Russian cyber operatives using the name “Guccifer 2.0,” and Stone also correctly predicted back in August 2016 that it would soon be Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s “turn in the barrel” in connection with the release of his hacked emails.\nThe working hypothesis by investigators is that either key documents from the WikiLeaks treasure trove were leaked to the Trump campaign in advance, or that Trump Campaign operatives were given notice of the keyword searches that would immediately identify the documents that were most damaging to the Clinton campaign.\nIn fact, the evidence is now emerging that one of the biggest fears of the Trump Campaign at the time was that someone would “jump the gun” and release some of the key WikiLeaks material even before WikiLeaks publicly released it. If that had happened, it would have created a huge problem for Trump and his campaign since such an error would have constituted a virtual admission that the campaign had been given advance notice of at least some to the WikiLeaks material.\nPaul Manafort played a central role as Trump’s campaign chairman during the critical March through August 2016 time-frame, when the groundwork was being laid for the intricate network of contacts that bound the Trump campaign, Russian intelligence operatives, Cambridge Analytica and WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange into formidable propaganda and disinformation machine. This was the international network that sufficiently threw the 2016 Presidential election campaign of Hillary Clinton into disarray and ultimately contributed significantly to Trump’s election win.\nOne of the key conduits between the Russians/WikiLeaks and the Trump Campaign/Cambridge Analytica was through Russia’s Alfa Bank. This bank is widely known among intelligence organizations to be a front for Russian intelligence, making “loans” and moving money around the globe in order to facilitate Russian operations abroad. The FBI is running down allegations that Cambridge Analytica and SCL have financial ties to Alfa Bank, and it is also focusing on the role played by Richard Burt, a top Trump advisor who sat on Alfa’s “senior advisory board.”\nAs you may recall, Alfa Bank and SVB Bank were the two named targets of the FISA warrant that was granted by the FISA court on October 15, 2016, one week after U.S. intelligence issues a public statement disclosing evidence of Russian voter database hacking. Part of the basis for this warrant was there was a high degree of suspicious database traffic between Russia and the Alfa Bank server located in Trump Towers. The suspicion is that Russian intelligence and WikiLeaks were using the Alfa Bank server to transmit hacked voting records and key hacked DNC/Clinton Campaign emails and documents to the Trump Campaign/Cambridge Analytica so that the Clinton Campaign could move swiftly to capitalize on this hacked data once WikiLeaks “officially” released it.\nAs part of the FISA warrant surveillance of Trump Tower, the conversations that Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn had with Sberbank, the sanctioned parent company of SVB Bank, were intercepted. This was only one of the many contacts that Flynn had with the Russians during and after the 2016 election that he “forgot” about. Flynn, to put it mildly, is a “dead man walking,” with only question of when (not whether) he will be indicted.","In early 2017, during the transition period and after Trump’s inauguration, Cambridge Analytica had a series of “talks” with Trump and his team. Included in these discussions where Bannon, Kelly Ann Conway, and other strategically-placed Mercer operatives in the White House. The subject was how CA would go about “managing public opinion” regarding Trump and his Administration’s policies. At the same time, since CA was expanding its operations into the U.S. commercial markets, it also entered into simultaneous discussions with the Trump Organization as to how it could best promote its real estate “products.”","Following the Trump election, CA also began intensive talks with right-wing parties and governments in Europe, Latin America, and Asia as to how its data manipulation services can be deployed so as to establish a world-wide hegemony of right-wing and authoritarian regimes. In a world of political polarization – driven in large part by “bots,” “trolls,” fake news, microtargeting and “dark” posts, Cambridge Analytica is now well on its way to becoming the darling of virtually every kleptocracy and authoritarian, anti-democratic regime.","CA’s pitch is simple but effective: In this brave new world order, CA is the right company at the right time for strong leaders that want to hold onto power or wrest control of the government back from the democratic, popularly-elected opposition forces. Russia is the prime example of how an efficient propaganda machine, combined with psychological profiling and manipulation of an entire electorate could keep one strongman – Vladimir Putin – in power for 17 years. Billions of dollars in sorely-needed cash has been allowed to Russia, as oligarchs and Putin’s own inner circle have moved money abroad to safer havens. Billions more have been lost to the Russian people and its economy through systematic graft and corruption. Political opposition leaders and journalists have been jailed and/or killed by the dozens, with complete impunity. The remnants of a free press have been largely driven into extinction or cowed into silence. The economy has stagnated for at least several years, and fewer and fewer jobs and career opportunities are open to young Russians. Meanwhile, the Russia’s state-sponsored propaganda machine has been able to keep Putin’s political support at about 80% by convincing them that he and only he can Make Russia Great Again and that all of the economic problems the country is experiencing is due to politically-motivated sanctions imposed on Mother Russia by the West.","Back in the dark ages of political “messaging” – 20 to 30 years ago — political campaigns spent much of their money and energy trying to get their candidate’s favorable narrative out to the voters through all available media outlets. These traditional media vehicles included direct mail, radio, TV, and even print (remember printed newspapers that you could hold and read, and wrap fish with after you were done?).","Then the internet and social media burst onto the scene, which exponentially increased a political campaign’s ability to manipulate voters on an intellectual, psychological and emotional level for a candidate or policy. Techies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere spent years building “platforms” for the purpose of large data collection and analysis, to predict people’s behavior. Cambridge Analytics added a psychological profiling dimension to this analysis, in order to not only predict a person’s behavior but to ultimately manipulate and change that person’s behavior to achieve the desired result, whether it be the act of voting for the preferred candidate or something else.","Taken to its logical conclusion, the ideal result was that the end user would develop a “digital addiction” to the data and information that was being fed into that person’s Facebook, Twitter or other social media account. Just as cigarette companies sold cigarettes for the purpose of hooking the user on the nicotine, so that the user would have to smoke more and more just to satisfy that nicotine addiction, most end users of an intensive internet propaganda campaign almost inevitably became hooked on the data that they were being bombarded with. This “information” was so ideally suited to their psychological, emotional and other preferences, that a psychological craving developed, requiring more and more of this kind of data messaging each day.\nOver time, it became apparent that the only difference between a digital addiction and an addiction to nicotine, crystal meth or opioids is that the digital addiction is psychological and emotional, not physical, but it can create the same kind of intense craving, and the withdrawal symptoms were virtually identical. Within a relatively short period, millions of Americans became digital addicts, needing their daily fix of personally-designed “news” to confirm and validate their preconceptions and beliefs, no matter how far removed from objective reality.","With the election of the grand master of disinformation himself – Donald J. Trump – Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group are ideally poised to support the Trump Administration’s ambitious plan to implement a Russian-type model of a state-controlled propaganda machine in this country. With its powerful “psychometric” components, Cambridge Analytica and SCL are well situated to use the personal and psychological information on private and government databases to immunize the Trump faithful. CA can keep any “bad” or “fake news” that might try to intrude into their awareness, from these “low information” voters. They can block and discredit mainstream media stories about how, for example, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the replacement with TrumpCare will be a disaster for countless millions of Americans.","Such “mainstream” stories will never reach the conscious or unconscious minds of the Trump voters because it will be drowned out by a steady stream of disinformation on social media and Trump-friendly news outlets that will continually reinforce those Trump voters’ preconceived biases for Trump and everything he does (or doesn’t do).","Meanwhile, Cambridge Analytica and SCL — energized and funded with virtually unlimited taxpayer-financed government contracts — will be able to target non-Trump voters with individually tailored and nearly irresistible messaging. A constant barrage of social media messaging will sufficiently confuse the target audience into acquiescing and withdrawing support from the democratic resistance movement, or actively converting “undecideds” or even anti-Trump Americans into admitting the error of their ways and converting to Trumpism.","We are headed for a Brave New World, based upon the currently formulated Trump/Mercer/SCL agenda. What could stop – or at least slow — this attack on the U.S.’s democratic institutions is the FBI and Justice Department. If these agencies are allowed to complete their investigation of the cyber-collusion between the Russians and the Trump Campaign without political interference, then the relevant federal grand juries will begin issuing criminal indictments against those responsible. One factor favoring a positive outcome of this ongoing investigation is that FBI Director James Comey – despite his Congressional testimony to the contrary – must deeply regret sending his “October Surprise” letter to Congress about the “reopening” of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. It is hard to explain how he did that without even mentioning one word about the fact that the FBI had a much more significant ongoing investigation at the time into possible collusion between the Russians and the Trump Team. Viewing it in the most charitable light, Comey must have thought what virtually every other person on the planet thought as of October 28, 2016, which was that Clinton – albiet bruised and battered by a brutal campaign – would stumble into the White House come election day. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20, and Comey would probably have taken a more even handed approach in his disclosures at the time if he had known what damage he was causing, or he would have just kept his mouth shut (which is what the FBI is supposed to do anyway).","By pursuing the Russian/Trump investigation to its logical and inevitable conclusion, Director Comey will finally be able clear his conscience and right some of the wrong he inflicted on the American body politic 11 days before the Presidential election.","Oh, and by the way, the release by the Justice Department and the FBI of a Grand Jury Report and accompanying federal indictments against those responsible for collaborating with the Russian/WikiLeaks meddling with our democratic and electoral processes will help repair some of the damage done to America’s frayed democratic and social fabric. Hopefully, such developments will also disrupt the Trump Administration’s plans to unleash its planned Russian-style permanent disinfo"],"isopubdate":"2017-05-09"}

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly “legitimate way and through proper channels” when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie.","Kogan’s app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","It seems that Facebook allowed Kogan’s app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as “likes,” because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators. Kogan was reportedly able to create more than 50 million profiles using the trend and characteristics data before providing them to Cambridge.","“Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” Wylie said of Cambridge, according to The New York Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Tech companies like Google, Twitter, and especially Facebook, have been hammered with criticism from a large portion of the population — including lawmakers — for purportedly helping Trump win the 2016 election with the platform’s inherent offerings. How much social media campaigns actually had an effect on election results appears dubious, or at least unclear, and may not even be quantifiable. What is more clear is that Facebook’s features can help sow seeds of further discord by allowing operators to capitalize on polarization.","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology, said in a statement. “While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways.”","Severalreports, including The NYT’s one, are referring to the actions of Cambridge Analytica — which had social media prowess described as the “secret sauce” to Trump’s political campaign — as a data “breach.” But as noted by Grewal in an update made Satuday morning, “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false” because Kogan requested and gained access through permissible, in fact standard, means. “Everyone involved gave their consent,” said Grewal.","Facebook says it is subjecting all apps that seek personal user information to its App Review process, “which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.”","We know first-hand that censorship against conservative news is real. Please share stories and encourage your friends to sign up for our daily email blast so they are not getting shut out of seeing conservative news."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Throughout the last year, every time bad news has broken, executives have downplayed its significance. Look at its public statements last year about how many people had seen Russian-bought election ads — first it was 10 million, then it was 126 million.","Top execs dodged Congress when it was asking questions about Russian interference. They are selling their shares at a record clip.","The actions of Facebook execs now recall how execs at Nokia and Blackberry reacted after the iPhone emerged. Their revenues kept growing for a couple years -- and they dismissed the threats. By the time users started leaving in droves, it was too late.","There's no outside attacker bringing Facebook down. It's a circular firing squad that stems from the company's fundamental business model of collecting data from users, and using that data to sell targeted ads. For years, users went along with the bargain. But after almost a year of constant negative publicity, their patience may be waning.","Facebook did not initially respond to questions or a request for comment from CNBC.","The drumbeat","For more than a year now, Facebook has been deflecting stories about how its platform was used during the 2016 presidential election.","Some of this activity — like Facebook embedding workers with the Trump campaign to tell them how to advertise more effectively — was perfectly legal, and in line with normal business practices. A lot of these tactics would probably have drawn no scrutiny if Donald Trump hadn't surprised everybody by winning an election that all the polls showed him losing.","Other activity was against Facebook's policies, or outright illegal. Most notably, a U.S. grand jury recently indicted 13 Russian nationals for conducting a disinformation campaign on American soil intended to further political divisions in the country and sway the election toward Trump. Their tactics included using Facebook groups to organize divisive political protests and buying targeted ads.","CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has remained aloof throughout the whole sequence of events.","He addresses some of these issues on personal Facebook posts, but seldom talks to the press about them. Last year, he spent most of the year doing photo ops with people around America, but did not show up when Congress asked questions about how the Russians used Facebook to influence the 2016 election.","This year, he announced his annual personal challenge would be fixing Facebook — in other words, doing his job as the CEO of a publicly traded company worth more than $500 billion. In past years, he's taught himself Mandarin and hunted his own food.","The spin","Over the weekend, Facebook gave a case study in how the company reacts inappropriately to negative news.","On Friday night, Facebook made a surprise announcement that the company had suspended a political analytics research firm, Cambridge Analytica. The firm was funded by large Republican donor Robert Mercer, and Trump's campaign used it to target ads on Facebook.","In its Friday post, Facebook claimed it had discovered new evidence that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted data about Facebook users passed to it by a Russian-American researcher, who had collected it through a personality quiz that 270,000 Facebook users took. The data included information like the cities where users lived and what they had \"liked\" on Facebook.","It was against Facebook's terms of use for the researcher to pass the data along. Cambridge Analytica had told Facebook it had deleted the data back in 2015, but Facebook said it had received recent reports to the contrary, according to the blog post.","(Cambridge Analytica has countered the allegations, saying it was in compliance with Facebook's guidelines, and that no data collected through the app was used in the Trump campaign.)","But as is often the case in political scandal, the problem isn't so much the original action, but the cover-up. Or in this case, the spin.","It turns out that Facebook didn't just spontaneously decide to ban the political research firm. It was actually trying to get ahead of two bombshell reports, in the New York Times and The Observer (the Sunday edition of U.K. paper The Guardian). The publications detailed exactly how Cambridge Analytica had collected information about Facebook users in a bid to target them with political messages.","Facebook knew about these news stories for some time. It also appears that the company was trying to squelch the reports.","The Times report claimed that, in private conversations with the newspaper, Facebook \"downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control.\" The Guardian wrote that \"Facebook's external lawyers warned the Observer it was making 'false and defamatory' allegations, and reserved Facebook's legal position.\"","The stories went ahead anyway. Once they were published, Facebook executives immediately took to Twitter to defend the company, insisting that this was not a \"breach.\"","In tweets that were later deleted, Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos called the stories \"important and powerful,\" while insisting that it was \"incorrect to call it a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\" The deleted tweets are preserved below:","Another senior Facebook exec, Andrew Bosworth, echoed that claim, saying it was \"unequivocally not a data breach.\"","So far, more than 24 hours after the stories, Zuckerberg and his number-two, COO Sheryl Sandberg, have not responded.","Missing the point","The Facebook executives who responded are correct — there was no security breach. Users gave their information willingly. Moreover, Facebook has since put better security controls for apps in place, so users can more easily control what information apps are gathering and how they're using it.","But they're missing the point.","Facebook users are slowly learning that almost anybody can use Facebook to collect detailed information about them, and that — at least some of the time — Facebook cannot control where this information flows, or how it is used. Using Facebook is like writing your life story down on a piece of paper, then taping it to a lamppost.","Journalists and privacy advocates may roll their eyes at this \"revelation\" — they've been warning people about Facebook and privacy since its inception.","Users mostly ignored these warnings. They wanted to share photos, connect with old friends, play games, take quizzes and watch videos, and Facebook gave them a simple way to do it. More than 2 billion people around the world now use the 14-year-old service, and Facebook sold nearly $40 billion worth of ads last year.","But things are beginning to change. There's a growing sense that Facebook has become creepy instead of fun.","A lot of people are noticing that the ads on Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram are so precisely targeted, they're sure the company is eavesdropping on their conversations through their phone microphones. (Facebook swears it is not — CNBC's Michelle Castillo has a great explanation of what is probably going on.)","More to the point, people are starting to curb their Facebook usage. In the fourth quarter, for the first time ever, the number of people in North America who used Facebook every day dropped from the previous year.","Also, Zuckerberg told investors on the company's earnings call that the company saw a 5 percent drop in time spent on Facebook during the quarter. The company claimed that this reduced engagement was because of some technical changes that Facebook made to crack down on low-quality content and give users a more positive experience.","These are just two small metrics. Facebook is still growing in many regions and by many other measurements.","But still: Fewer people using Facebook every day in one region, and spending less time on it. That's never happened before.","For the time being, advertisers are grumbling about Facebook and warning their clients to stay away from certain ad products, but they're still putting their money there — with an audience over 2 billion and some of the most accurate ad targeting available, Facebook is still impossible to ignore.","But if usage continues to decline, advertisers will start eventually follow. And there are plenty of hungry smaller competitors — Twitter and Snap, particularly — who would be happy to take some of that money.","Executive stock sales not reassuring","Meanwhile, Facebook executives are not exactly sending a reassuring message to investors by unloading their shares at a rapid clip.","Last summer, after Zuckerberg's plan to create another class of stock to solidify his control of the company foundered, he announced he'd begin selling off up to 75 million shares (about 18 percent of his stake), worth nearly $13 billion, by mid-2019. The money will support the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), his other company devoted to good works.","Why now? Zuckerberg is 33 years old -- far from retirement. What exactly is CZI doing that requires such a massive investment? Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is building rocket ships to explore space with his other company Blue Origin, and he only needs to spend $1 billion a year.","Other top executives are also selling in massive amounts. Jan Koum, who founded the messaging app WhatsApp, which Facebook bought in 2014 for $19 billion, sold $2.8 billion worth of shares last year — more than any exec at any major tech company. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sold $2 billion of stock last year, in part to fund Blue Origin. Nobody else is close.)","Sandberg sold over $300 million, which pales in comparison to her colleagues but is still unusually large among officers of top tech companies.","Facebook stock is up over 80 percent in the last 12 months. Perhaps these execs are just taking gains, as any normal employee with stock compensation would be advised to do.","But these are not normal employees. They're the leaders of the company.","Other leaders keep skin in the game during difficult times -- think of how Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer held on to most of his stock throughout his tenure, even as Microsoft faced expensive antitrust lawsuits and growing competitive threats, or how Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey bought shares in 2017 when many investors had written the company off.","Facebook is facing real problems. Instead of giving answers to those problems, top execs are selling, spinning and staying silent."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Cambridge Analytica to be “thoroughly investigated” and said Facebook must answer questions about how it came to provide private user information to an academic with links to Russia.","The Republican majority on the House intelligence committee announced this week they were winding up their investigation into Russia’s election interference, concluding there was no collusion with Trump’s campaign and, even more controversially, that Moscow did not seek to assist him. Schiff fiercely condemned that decision and said the Democratic minority would continue working on prescriptions for protecting the country in the future.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users, whether it acquired that information illegally and whether it sought to abuse that information in support of President Trump’s political campaign in the United States or Brexit in the United Kingdom,” he told the Guardian.","“The company has repeatedly touted its ability to influence voters through ‘psychographic’ targeting and has claimed it was the fundamental reason that Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Indeed, it may be that through Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign made use of illegitimately acquired data on millions of Americans in order to help sway the election.”","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2m, according to Federal Election Commission records.

Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by Cambridge Analytica, working with Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), was a data breach.","It also suspended the whistleblower Chris Wylie from the platform “pending further information” over misuse of data, along with his former employer Cambridge Analytica and its affiliates, and the academic they worked with, Kogan.","The public attack on Wylie came after he had approached the tech company about the data breach, offering to help investigate.

The latest individual to #DeleteFacebook is no less than the privacy commissioner of New Zealand.","Writing in The Spinoff, John Edwards accuses Facebook of being non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act — and urges other New Zealanders to follow his lead and ditch the social network.","He says he’s acting after a complaint that Facebook failed to provide a user in New Zealand with information it held on them.","“Every New Zealander has the right to find out what information an agency holds about them. It is a right of constitutional significance,” he writes. “Facebook failed to meet its obligations under the Privacy Act, and when given a statutory demand from my office to produce the information at issue so that I could discharge my statutory duty to the requester to review it, Facebook initially refused to provide it, and then asserted that Facebook was not subject to the New Zealand Privacy Act, and was therefore under no obligation to provide it.","“Our investigation was not able to proceed, and we notified the parties that while we were able to conclude that Facebook’s actions constituted an interference with privacy, and a failure to comply with its obligations both to the requester, and to my Office, there was nothing further we could do.”","Facebook’s strategy of arguing it is not under the jurisdiction of privacy laws in international markets is a standard play for the company which instructs its lawyers to argue it is only subject to Irish data protection law, given its international HQ is based in Ireland.","(NB: The geographical distance between Ireland and New Zealand is roughly 18,600km — a vast physical span that of course presents no barrier to Facebook’s digital business making money by mining personal data in New Zealand.)","The company’s ‘your local privacy rules don’t apply to our international business’ strategy appears to be on borrowed time, in Europe at least — with some European courts already feeling able to deny Facebook’s claim that Ireland be its one-stop shop for any/all international legal challenges.","The EU also has a major update to its data protection framework incoming, the GDPR, which will apply from May 25 — and which ramps up the liabilities for companies ignoring data protection rules by bringing in a new penalty regime that scales as high as 4% of a organizations global turnover (for Facebook that could mean fines as large as $1.6BN, based on the ~$40.6BN it earned last year — per its 2017 full year results).","And that’s all before you consider the huge public and political pressure now being brought to bear on the company over data handling and user privacy, as a result of the current data misuse scandal. Which has also wiped off billions in share value — and led to a bunch of lawsuits.","“We applied our naming policy and today have identified Facebook as non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act in order to inform consumers of the non-compliance, the associated risks, and their options for protecting their data,” adds Edwards, joining the anti-Facebook pile-on.","“Under current law there is little more I am able to do to practically to protect my, or New Zealanders’ data on Facebook. I will continue to assert that Facebook is obliged to comply with New Zealand law in relation to personal information it holds and uses in relation to its New Zealand users, and in due course a case may come before the courts, either through my Office, or at the suit of the company.”","He goes on to suggest that the 2.5 million New Zealanders who use Facebook could consider modifying their settings and postings on the platform in light of its current non-compliant terms and conditions — or even delete their account altogether, linking to a page on the commission’s own website which explains how to delete a Facebook account.","So, er, ouch.","In response to the commissioner’s actions, Facebook has decided to try to brand the country’s privacy commissioner himself as, er, hostile to privacy…","A Facebook spokesperson emailed us the following statement:","We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year’s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticised us for protecting their privacy. We scrutinize all requests to disclose personal data, particularly the contents of private messages, and will challenge those that are overly broad. We have investigated the complaint from the person who contacted the Commissioner’s office but we haven’t been provided enough detail to fully resolve it. Instead, the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data. We have a long history of working with the Commissioner, and we will continue to request information that will help us investigate this complaint further.","This of course is pure spin — and a very clunky attempt by Facebook to shift attention off the nub of the issue: Its own non-compliance with privacy laws outside its preferred legal jurisdictions.","Frankly it’s a very risky PR strategy at a time when it really has become impossible for Facebook to deny quite how comfortable the company was, up until mid 2015, to hand over reams of personal information on Facebookers to third party users of its developer platform — without requiring these external entities gain individual level consent (friends could ‘consent’ for all their friends!).","The non-compliance of Facebook with European data protection laws was in the spotlight yesterday, during an oral hearing in front of the UK parliamentary committee that’s looking into the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data misuse scandal — as part of a wider enquiry into online disinformation and political campaigning.","Giving testimony to the committee as an expert witness Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of PersonalData.IO — a startup service designed to help people control how their personal information is accessed by companies — recounted how he had spent “years” trying to obtain his personal information from Facebook.","Dehaye said his persistence in pressing the company eventually led it to build a tool that lets Facebook users obtain a subset list of advertisers who hold their contact information — though only for a rolling eight week period.","Downloaded FB data also gives you insight into whom else has data on you (used to run custom audiences). Have never engaged with 75% of these… pic.twitter.com/dQPjIcI8CW","“I personally had 200 advertisers that had declared to Facebook that they had my consent to advertise. One of them is Booz Allen Hamilton, which is an information company,” Dehaye told the committee. “I don’t know how [BAH got my data]. I don’t know why they think they have my consent on this. Where that information comes from. I would be curious to ask.”","Asked whether he was surprised by the data Facebook held on him and also by the company’s reluctance to share this personal information, Dehaye said he had been surprised they “implemented something” — i.e. the tool that gives an eight week snapshot.","But he also argued this glimpse is illustrative because it underlines just how much Facebook still isn’t telling users.","“They implicitly acknowledge that yes they should disclose that information,” said Dehaye, adding: “You have to think that these databases are probably trawled through by a tonne of intelligence services to now figure out what happened in all those different circumstances. And also by Facebook itself to assess what happened.”","“Facebook is invoking an exception in Irish law in the data protection law — involving, ‘disproportionate effort’. So they’re saying it’s too much of an effort to give me access to this data. I find that quite intriguing because they’re making essentially a technical and a business argument for why I shouldn’t be given access to this data — and in the technical argument they’re in a way shooting themselves in the foot. Because what they’re saying is they’re so big that there’s no way they could provide me with this information. The cost would be too large.","“It’s not just about their user base being so large — if you parse their argument, it’s about the number of communications that are exchanged. And usually that’s taken of a measure of dominance of a communication medium. So they are really arguing ‘we are too big to comply with data protection law’. The costs would be too high for us. Which is mindboggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make that argument?”","“They don’t price the cost itself,” he added. “They don’t say it would cost us this much [to comply with the data request]. If they were starting to put a cost on getting your data out of Facebook — you know, every tiny point of data — that would be very interesting to have to compare with smaller companies, smaller social networks. If you think about how antitrust laws work, that’s the starting point for those laws. So it’s kind of mindboggling that they don’t see their argumentation, how it’s going to hurt them at some point.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

{"originalurl":"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/trump-mueller.html?mwrsm=Facebook&referer=http://m.facebook.com/","title":"Trump Assails Mueller, Drawing Rebukes From Republicans - The New York Times","text":["Trump Assails Mueller, Drawing Rebukes From Republicans","WASHINGTON — President Trump on Sunday abandoned a strategy of showing deference to the special counsel examining Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, lashing out at what he characterized as a partisan investigation and alarming Republicans who feared he might seek to shut it down.","Mr. Trump has long suggested that allegations that he or his campaign conspired with Russia to influence the election were a “hoax” and part of a “witch hunt,” but until this weekend he had largely heeded the advice of lawyers who counseled him not to directly attack Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, for fear of antagonizing prosecutors.","“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!”","The attack on Mr. Mueller, a longtime Republican and former F.B.I. director appointed by a Republican president, George W. Bush, drew immediate rebukes from some members of the party who expressed concern that it might presage an effort to fire the special counsel. Such a move, they warned, would give the appearance of a corrupt attempt to short-circuit the investigation and set off a bipartisan backlash.","“If he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we’re a rule-of-law nation,” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an ally of the president, said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “When it comes to Mr. Mueller, he is following the evidence where it takes him, and I think it’s very important he be allowed to do his job without interference, and there are many Republicans who share my view.”","Among them was Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a sharp critic of Mr. Trump who appeared on the same program. “People see that as a massive red line that can’t be crossed,” he said. He urged Mr. Trump’s advisers to prevail on him not to fire Mr. Mueller. “We have confidence in Mueller.”","Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, said if the president was innocent, he should “act like it” and leave Mr. Mueller alone, warning of dire repercussions if the president tried to fire the special counsel.","“I would just counsel the president — it’s going to be a very, very long, bad 2018, and it’s going to be distracting from other things that he wants to do and he was elected do,” Mr. Gowdy said on “Fox News Sunday.” “Let it play out its course. If you’ve done nothing wrong, you should want the investigation to be as fulsome and thorough as possible.”","The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, issued a statement likewise warning Mr. Trump to back off. “As the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job,” said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman. His counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, had no comment, as did a number of other top Senate Republicans.","Late in the day, the White House tried to douse the furor. “In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the administration, the White House yet again confirms that the president is not considering or discussing the firing of the special counsel, Robert Mueller,” Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer, said in a statement.","The president’s tweet followed a statement by Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, on Saturday calling on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Trump followed up that evening with a tweet arguing that “the Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.”","The two weekend tweets were the first time Mr. Trump has used Mr. Mueller’s name on Twitter, not counting a message he once retweeted, and reflected what advisers called a growing impatience fueled by anger that the investigation was now looking at his business activities.","The New York Times reported last week that Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed records from the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump’s lawyers met with Mr. Mueller’s team last week and received more details about how the special counsel is approaching the investigation, including the scope of his interest in the Trump Organization.","For months, Mr. Trump had been reassured by his lawyers that the investigation would wrap up soon — by Thanksgiving, then Christmas, then New Year’s. But with the expansion into Mr. Trump’s business, it seems increasingly clear that Mr. Mueller is not ready to conclude his inquiry.","A top adviser to Mr. Trump said on Sunday that the White House had grown weary of the inquiry. “We have cooperated in every single way, every single paper they’ve asked for, every single interview,” Marc Short, the president’s legislative director, said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “There’s a growing frustration that after a year and millions and millions of dollars spent on this, there remains no evidence of collusion with Russia.”","A president cannot directly fire a special counsel but can order his attorney general to do so. Even then, a cause has to be cited, like conflict of interest. Since Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former campaign adviser, has recused himself from the Russia investigation — to Mr. Trump’s continuing irritation — the task would fall to the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein.","But Mr. Rosenstein said as recently as last week that he sees no justification for firing Mr. Mueller, meaning that he would either have to change his mind or be removed himself. The third-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rachel Brand, knowing this issue could reach her, decided last month to step down. The next official in line would be the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, a former White House and Justice Department lawyer under Mr. Bush.","Mr. Trump sought to have Mr. Mueller fired last June but backed down after his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit. The president told The Times a month later that Mr. Mueller would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia.","The White House made no assertion last week that the subpoena to the Trump Organization crossed that red line, but Mr. Trump evidently has grown tired of the strategy of being respectful to the special counsel. His focus on Democrats working for Mr. Mueller could be aimed at demonstrating conflict of interest that would merit dismissal.","When Mr. Mueller assembled his team, he surrounded himself with trusted former colleagues and experts on specific crimes like money laundering. As the team filled out, Republican allies of Mr. Trump noted that some members had previously contributed to Democratic candidates.","In particular, Republicans pointed to Andrew Weissmann, who served as F.B.I. general counsel under Mr. Mueller. Mr. Weissmann is a career prosecutor but, while in private law practice, donated thousands of dollars toward President Barack Obama’s election effort.","In his Sunday morning Twitter blasts, Mr. Trump also renewed his attacks on James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Andrew G. McCabe, his former deputy, both of whom, like Mr. Mueller, are longtime Republicans. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last May, at first attributing the decision to the F.B.I. director’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server but later telling an interviewer that he had the Russia investigation in mind when he made the decision.","Mr. Sessions, under intense public pressure from Mr. Trump, fired Mr. McCabe on Friday after an inspector general found that he had not been forthcoming about authorizing F.B.I. officials to provide information about the Clinton inquiry in 2016 to a reporter.","“Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked ‘have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?’” Mr. Trump wrote. “He said strongly ‘never, no.’ He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.”","Mr. Trump went on to dismiss reports that Mr. McCabe kept detailed memos of his time as deputy F.B.I. director, just as Mr. Comey did. Mr. McCabe left those memos with the F.B.I., which means Mr. Mueller’s team has access to them.","“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”","Michael R. Bromwich, Mr. McCabe’s lawyer, fired back by accusing the president of corrupting the law enforcement system. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” he wrote on Twitter. “The whole truth will come out in due course. But the tweets confirm that he has corrupted the entire process that led to Mr. McCabe’s termination and has rendered it illegitimate.”","In suggesting that Mr. Comey lied under oath to Congress, Mr. Trump appeared to refer to a comment by Mr. McCabe that the former director had authorized the news media interaction at the heart of the complaint against him. The president’s Republican allies picked up the point on Sunday and pressed for appointment of a prosecutor to look at the origin of the Russia investigation.","“So we know that McCabe has lied” because the inspector general concluded he had not been fully candid, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, said on Fox News. “Now he’s saying about Comey — Comey may have lied as well. So I don’t think this is the end of it. But that’s why we need a second special counsel.”","Other Republicans, however, suggested that the Trump administration was going too far. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida criticized the decision to fire Mr. McCabe on a Friday night shortly before his retirement took effect, jeopardizing his pension.","“I don’t like the way it happened,” Mr. Rubio said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “He should’ve been allowed to finish through the weekend.” Speaking of the president, he added: “Obviously he doesn’t like McCabe and he’s made that pretty clear now for over a year. We need to be very careful about taking these very important entities and smearing everybody in them with a broad stroke.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

This is the way of the modern world: Smart companies build apps and websites that keep our eyeballs engaged, and we reward them with our data and attention, which benefit their bottom line.","Andrew McMillen is a freelance writer and the author of Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs.","Steemit, a nascent social media platform, is trying to change all that by rewarding its users with cold, hard cash in the form of a cryptocurrency. Everything that you do on Steemit—every post, every comment, and every like—translates to a fraction of a digital currency called Steem. Over time, as Steem accumulates, it can be cashed out for normal currency. (Or held, if you think Steem is headed for a bright future.)","The idea for Steemit began with a white paper, which quietly spread among a small community of techies when it was released in March 2016. The exhaustive 44-page overview wasn’t intended for a general audience, but the document contained a powerful message. User-generated content, the authors argued, had created billions of dollars of value for the shareholders of social media companies. Yet while moguls like Mark Zuckerberg got rich, the content creators who fueled networks like Facebook got nothing. Steemit’s creators outlined their intention to challenge that power imbalance by putting a value on contributions: “Steem is the first cryptocurrency that attempts to accurately and transparently reward…[the] individuals who make subjective contributions to its community.”","A minuscule but dedicated audience rallied around Steemit, posting stories and experimenting with the form to discover what posts attracted the most votes and comments. When Steemit released its first payouts that July, three months after launch, things got serious.","Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are only worth whatever value people ascribe to them, so there was no guarantee that the tokens dropping into Steemit accounts would ever be worth anything. Yet the Steem that rolled out to users translated to more than $1.2 million in American dollars. Overnight, the little-known currency spiked to a $350 million market capitalization—momentarily rocketing it into the rare company of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the world’s highest-valued cryptocurrencies.","Today, Steem’s market capitalization has settled in the vicinity of $294 million. One Steem is worth slightly more than one United States Dollar, and the currency remains a regular presence at the edge of the top 20 most traded digital currencies.","It’s a precipitous rise for a company that just 18 months ago existed only as an idea in the minds of its founders. More than $30 million worth of Steem has been distributed to over 50,000 users since its launch, according to company reports. It’s too early to know whether Steemit can hold onto its users’ interest and its market value. But its goal—upending a model built by social media giants over decades of use in favor of a more populist system—is significant in itself. By removing the middlemen and allowing users to profit directly from the networks they participate in, Steemit could provide a roadmap to a more equitable social network.","Or users could get bored or distracted by something newer and shinier and abandon it. The possibility of a popped bubble looms over every cryptocurrency, and the bubbles are filled with both attention and speculative investment. Steemit’s value is based on money that its founders have virtually willed into existence. Fortunes could vanish at any moment, but someone stands to get rich in the process.","The creators of Steemit didn’t set out to build a social network. When Ned Scott and Dan Larimer first spoke on the phone in mid-2015, having previously chatted online, they began dreaming up new applications for blockchains—the distributed, verified databases that back today’s wave of digital currencies. Scott, a former financial analyst, was fascinated by the economics that drive cryptocurrencies. Larimer, a computer scientist, already had cryptocurrency bona fides, having developed an ambitious exchange called BitShares.","At first, they were intrigued by the idea of using the hivemind trust of blockchain to create an insurance network. They wondered if they could incentivize a group of people to pool money, which could then be drawn upon by an individual in the event of an accident or emergency—a kind of libertarian backup plan.","But in order to make it work, they needed a way to hold people accountable. Their plan hinged on building a robust communications forum. By linking people’s accounts to their discussions, each individual’s claims and communications would be both able to be audited and unable to be censored. The community would have to evaluate each claim, voting the best posts towards the top. That’s when the wider scope of their project took shape. “We realized that this is going to look a lot like Reddit,” says Scott, “but people are going to get paid for participating.”","Today, Scott supports the software development of the platform and currency from the company headquarters in Austin, Texas, alongside a distributed team of 30 staff worldwide. Larimer resigned from his role as chief technology officer in March, but continues to post on Steemit; the pair published a joint statement announcing the separation, emphasizing that they “parted on amicable terms without dispute.”","At its core, Steemit looks a lot like any other social network. The most popular tags include things like photography, life, travel, art, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, Steemit itself. Scott’s favorite success stories involve people who use the site to both document and fund their explorations—like a travel blogger and photographer (username: @heiditravels; 5,904 followers) who has funded her trips around the world with Steem, and a young man in West Africa (@infovore; 3,479 followers) who started a popular “Steem magazine” about the currency and its pop-up community. @infovore’s regular posts earned him a global audience, as well as the equivalent of $41,000 in virtual currency during his first few months on the site.","According to Scott, Steemit boasts an “incredibly small” number of trolls, which he argues is because of the cash incentive. (It could also be due to the relatively small community, which includes around 350,000 registered accounts as of September.) “For the first time, there’s an opportunity cost to trolling,” says the cofounder. “Every second that someone spends trolling, they’re potentially damaging their reputation and preventing themselves from earning any Steem.” New users are also encouraged to introduce themselves to the community, and take a photo of their smiling face in order to verify their account, which may be a contributing factor: So far, it seems that anonymity is less prized on Steemit than on Reddit, where “throwaway” accounts are commonplace.","You might have heard of Bitcoin mining operations where racks of powerful PC processors are dedicated to solving complex mathematical problems. Their electricity bills are enormous, but so are the potential rewards for mining Bitcoin, which is likely to become more valuable—and more difficult to mine—as the currency approaches its maximum circulation of 21 million coins. In these more traditional “proof-of-work” blockchains, tokens are distributed to the people whose computers are performing work, known as “miners.”","Steem is designed differently. Its tokens are generated at a fixed rate of one block every three seconds, which are then distributed to various parties in the system based on the blockchain’s rules. These parties are incentivized to compete in ways that add value to the network: 75 percent of new tokens are distributed to the “rewards pool” for content creators and curators, while smaller fractions are awarded to vested token holders.","Steemit’s function is rooted in transparency. Every action a user makes on the site is logged on the blockchain—meaning every vote, currency transfer, and even the amount of Steem sitting in someone’s digital wallet, is public and viewable. There are two ways of earning Steem. The first is the “rewards pool” of digital tokens, which incentivize content creation and curation—in other words, quality posts that are upvoted by other users. The second is a voting system which assigns a value to each post and comment on the platform, and then distributes Steem tokens to the creators based on the wisdom of the crowd. The more users that upvote your posts on Steemit, the more Steem you’ll earn, which can then be cashed out of your wallet using an online currency exchange.","Much like Reddit, Steemit is an experiment in group psychology, where the human hivemind (as tallied by individual votes) determines the most popular—and lucrative—content. In contrast, invisible but immensely powerful algorithms control what each Facebook and Instagram user sees in their feeds. “On Reddit, there are people who put up links and posts, and are then accused of ‘karma whoring’—or basically, selling out to get these worthless internet points,” says Scott. “On Steemit, people show up to earn Steem. They’re posting and linking stuff, and they’re earning something that’s worth real money.”","A weighted voting system places greater value on votes placed by the older accounts of early Steemit adopters, who appear to be in it for the long haul. While a vote from a brand-new user may be worth a fraction of a cent, a vote from someone who has gained a reputation for posting quality content each day might be worth several dollars. In turn, the valuable votes of these “power users” attract votes from a crowd of less powerful users seeking to cash in on the action, like ants jostling for crumbs.","Under this weighted model, individuals who have contributed the most to the platform have greater influence over how other contributions are scored—which creates a snowballing effect. Some have argued that this system unfairly benefits the founders and those in their network who were attracted early to Steemit. Case in point: My own year-old Steemit account (@andrewmcmillen) is worth approximately USD $1,300. As of early October Ned Scott’s account, @ned, has an estimated account value of USD $5.08 million.","Cryptocurrency has been all but impenetrable for the average person, who might struggle to recall a handful of computer passwords, let alone safely store the proverbial keys to a virtual bank account. It exists as an esoteric part of modern life. Only the most motivated users have educated themselves about how to trade real dollars for currency, and then use said currency to their advantage. The rise of Bitcoin, for instance, is linked to black markets; once someone figured out it could facilitate the distribution of drugs through sites on the dark web, like Silk Road, the currency’s value took off. Today, Bitcoin accounts for a little less than half of the entire cryptocurrency trading market; its nearest competitor is Ethereum, which occupies about 20 percent.","But the most innovative aspect of Steem is its lack of friction: New users can join Steemit and begin earning tiny fractions of the currency immediately, without even understanding how it works. It is designed as cryptocurrency for the masses, as the barriers to entry are almost nonexistent. Unlike Bitcoin, there’s no messing around with coin traders or triple-checking long, fiddly strings of letters and numbers to make sure you’re not accidentally sending your money to a Nigerian prince.","On Steemit, you simply create an account, start browsing the site, upvote posts you like, and search for the gaps you might fill by posting something of your own. If you’re not creative, no problem: You can curate by spotting high-quality posts soon after they’re published and voting for them as a kind of early investor, before the rest of the crowd arrives.","Related Stories","The gamification is by design. “It’s as though all the users are playing a social media game, and they’re earning points based on how well they participate,” says Scott. Years ago, he loved playing the action role-playing computer game Diablo II. “All of the characters in the game had the ability to cast spells, and they had ‘mana’ they could use,” he says. “As they cast spells, the mana was used up; over time, it regenerated, so they could cast more spells later. Voting power here works similarly: Users come back every day to try and vote better, and level up.”","With about 40 votes per day at their disposal, regular Steemit users are playing a lottery, where the outcome is turning internet points into real-world dollars. It’s not a get-rich-quick scheme; it requires significant time investment before you start to see more than a few cents per day.","As with any other cryptocurrency, the virtual bubble that surrounds this idea could pop at any moment, and all of that time and effort you’ve invested into earning Steem could be worth nothing—which happens to be precisely the same amount you earn when you post on any other social media website.","Related Video","Chris Dixon, general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, thinks you should reconsider the power of bitcoin.

You have to opt in and agree to your personal data being stored and/or re-used for this purpose.","You should also be given the following information before you decide to opt in:","information about the company/ organisation that will process your data, including their contact details, and the contact details of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) if there is one","the reason why the company /organisation will use your personal data","how long they intend to keep your personal data","details of any other company or organisation that will receive your personal data","All this information should be presented in a clear and understandable way.","Withdrawing consent to use personal data and the right to object","If you previously gave your consent for a company or organisation to use your personal data, you can contact the data controller (the person or body handling your personal data) and withdraw your permission at any time. Once you've withdrawn your permission, the company or organisation can no longer use your personal data.","When an organisation is processing your personal data on the basis of their own legitimate interest or as part of a task in the public interest or for an official authority, you may have the right to object. In some specific cases, public interest may prevail and the company or organisation may be allowed to continue using your personal data. For example, this could be the case for scientific research and statistics, a task performed as part of the official role of a public authority.","For direct marketing emails that promote particular brands or products, your prior consent is required. However, if you are an existing customer of a particular company, they can send you direct marketing emails about their own similar products or services. You have the right to object at any time to receiving such direct marketing and the company have to stop using your data immediately.","In all cases, you should always be given information about the right to object to the use of your personal data the first time that the company or organisation contacts you.","Sample story","You can object to your data being used for direct marketing","Anatolios bought two tickets online to see his favourite band play in a live concert. Since buying the tickets, Anatolios started receiving emails with adverts for concerts and events that he wasn't interested in. He contacted the online ticketing company and asked them to stop sending him these advertising emails. The company immediately removed him from their direct marketing lists. Anatolios was happy that he didn't get any more advertising emails from them.","Specific rules for children","If your children want to use online services, such as social media, downloading music or games, they will often need approval from you, as their parent or legal guardian, as these services use the child's personal data. Your child will no longer need parental consent once they're aged over 16 (in some EU countries this age limit might be as low as 13). Controls to check parental consent have to be effective, for example by using a verification message sent to a parent's email address.","Access to your personal data","You can request access to the personal data a company or organisation has about you, and you have the right to get a copy of your data, free of charge, in an accessible format. They should reply to you within 1 month and have to give you a copy of your personal data and any relevant information about how the data has been used, or is being used.","Sample story","You have a right to know what data is stored about you and how it's used","Maciej, from Poland, recently subscribed to his local supermarket's loyalty scheme. Shortly after joining the scheme, he noticed he started receiving better discount vouchers for his shopping. He wondered if this was related to the loyalty scheme, so he asked the supermarket's data protection officer to tell him which information was being stored about him and how it was being used. Maciej discovered that the supermarket kept data on the products he bought every week and then was able to give him discounts related to the specific products he liked to buy.","Correcting your personal data","If a company or organisation has stored personal data about you that isn't correct or is missing some information, then you can ask them to correct or update your data.","Sample story","You have the right to correct incorrect data about yourself","Alison wanted to buy a new house in Ireland and applied for a mortgage from her bank. When completing the registration form, she made a mistake entering her date of birth and the bank registered her age incorrectly in their system.","When Alison got the offers for her new mortgage and associated life insurance, she realised the mistake, as her insurance premium was much higher than her current one. She contacted the bank and asked them to correct her personal data in their system. She then received a new version of the insurance offer that correctly indicated her date of birth.","Transferring your personal data (right to data portability)","In certain situations, you can ask a company or organisation to return your data to you or to transfer it directly to another company, if this is technically possible. This is known as \"data portability\". For example, you can use this right if you decide to switch from one service to another similar service – for example moving from one social media site to a new one – and you'd like your personal information to be quickly and easily transferred to the new service.","Deleting your personal data (the right to be forgotten)","If your personal data is no longer needed or is being used unlawfully then you can ask for your data to be erased. This is known as \"the right to be forgotten\".","These rules also apply to search engines, such as Google, as they're also considered to be data controllers. You can ask for links to web pages including your name to be removed from search engine results, if the information is inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive.","If a company has made your personal data available online and you ask for them to be deleted, the company also has to inform any other websites where they've been shared that you've asked for your data and links to them to be deleted.","To protect other rights, such as freedom of expression, some data may not be automatically deleted. For example, controversial statements made by people in the public eye, might not be deleted if public interest is best served by keeping them online.","Sample story","You can ask for your personal data to be deleted and removed from other websites","Alfredo decided he no longer wanted to use any social media, so he deleted his profile from the social media sites he was using. However, a few weeks later he found his old profile photos from his social media accounts were still visible when he looked up his name in an internet search engine. Alfredo contacted the social media companies and asked them to ensure that these photos were removed. When he searched a month later, the photos had indeed been removed and they no longer appeared in the search engine results.","Unauthorised access to your data (data breach)","If your personal information is stolen, lost or illegally accessed – known as a 'personal data breach' – the data controller (the person or body handling your personal data) must report it to the national data protection authority. The data controller must also inform you directly if there are serious risks related to your personal data or privacy due to the breach.","Making a complaint","If you think your data protection rights have not been respected, you can make a complaint directly to your national data protection authority which will investigate your complaint and give you a response within 3 months.","You can also chose to file a case directly in court against the company or organisation concerned instead of first going to your national data protection authority.","You may be entitled to compensation if you suffer material damage, such as financial loss, or non-material damage, such as psychological distress, due to a company or organisation not respecting EU data protection rules.","What about cookies?","Cookies are small text files that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device.

I have been particularly concerned about the way Indian customer data is flowing to Chinese and American entities, as I mentioned in these pages earlier (Tech giants and data: Is India giving away a treasure trove of data about its citizens?)","However, until the Cambridge Analytica case blew up so spectacularly, there hasn’t been a concrete instance of data affecting something politicians actually care about: losing elections. So now calls for regulation will be positively deafening.","The allegation about Cambridge Analytica, based on information from a whistleblower named Chris Wylie, is that it has (possibly illegally, and almost certainly unethically) used deep information about 50 million voters (some say it is almost all 230 million US voters), gathered from their Facebook feeds and their friends’ Facebook feeds, to influence them in subtle ways. The reason this is causing an uproar, is because there is a chance that Steve Bannon, a former Trump aide, may well have influenced these voters to plump for President Donald Trump.","Advertisement","But that partisan point has resonance in India as well, because the same Cambridge Analytica has been talked about by the Indian National Congress as its potential marketing partner. Even though there is nothing definitive about an agreement between them, but many news stories suggest they were in late-stage discussions.","An intriguing suggestion from a reader Anand was as follows: a key goal in the US campaign was “voter disengagement” and persuading Democratic Party voters to “stay at home”. In the wake of the large number of NOTAs (non of the above) in Gujarat, and the very low turnout in Gorakhpur, is a similar ‘voter disengagement’ strategy being rolled out in India as well? Maybe then there’s a stealth campaign already in place in India with Cambridge Analytica? Is this the preferred Congress tactic for 2019?","There was always something a little sinister about Cambridge Analytica, and people have mumbled darkly about its role in the Brexit and Trump campaigns. And now it appears as though the suspicions had merit: Wylie, as reported in a detailed profile in The Guardian, (part of the Cambridge Analytica Files, 17 March claims he “made Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindf*** tool”.","Advertisement","Wylie, the whistleblower, was employed by SCL Elections, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, which is a joint venture between SCL Elections and Robert Mercer, a hedge-fund billionaire and an active supporter of Republican causes in the US, as well as of Donald Trump. It turns out that (quoted from the above Guardian story):","…[SCL Elections’] expertise was in “psychological operations” - or psyops - changing people’s minds not through persuasion but through “informational dominance”, a set of techniques that rumour, disinformation and fake news.","SCL Elections had used a similar suite of tools in more than 200 elections around the world, mostly in undeveloped democracies that Wylie would come to recognise were unequipped to defend themselves. [emphasis mine]","Advertisement","India being one of those “underdeveloped democracies” they toyed with makes me queasy. Yes, they used a standard military psy-war operation to turn the data from those millions of Americans into a potent information warfare weapon. In essence, by gaining an understanding of the individual peculiarities of voters (for instance, through correlations such as the one that says leftists are more likely to buy Nike shoes), they were able to tailor messages to individuals that would work on their particular psychologies. By deeply analysing the Facebook data, they were able to extrapolate and deduce many things about the users that are not obvious.","This sort of staggering extrapolation is not new: there was a story recently about how, by simply analysing Uber traffic data, it was possible to figure out who was having an affair with whom! Thus our ‘digital footprint’ betrays us in all sorts of ways. The dictum “data is the new oil” is not entirely vacuous, it turns out. Also, a widely-reported story in Science showed that fake news was six times as likely as real news to go viral.","These revelations have already had an impact on Facebook, already embattled over accusations about fake news. It’s stock fell 4 per cent in trading before exchanges opened; and this is likely to increase the calls for accountability on the parts of several dominant technology companies, especially Facebook, Google and Twitter. They have generally been able to claim that they are merely platforms and are therefore not responsible for the content that is posted on them.","Advertisement","That argument may not hold water anymore; increasingly alarmed regulators may impose stiff conditions on privacy protection, as envisaged in the European data protection regulations that go into effect in May. China, Vietnam, Singapore, etc. are considering similar regulations so that data about their citizens has to be maintained in-country. It is high time India also imposed laws that insist that, as in the Chinese cyber-security law, insist that “personal information and other important data gathered or produced by critical information infrastructure operators” should be stored in mainland China, according to The Economist (Technopolitics, 15 March).","In any case, I think we are seeing a watershed moment in the history of the use of private data to stealthily subvert the democratic process, and Facebook and its tech friends may face a serious backlash. Whether this will finally persuade lethargic regulators in India, to put in place regulations about data protection, remains to be seen.

But as someone who has spent my entire adult life in marketing until recently, I would offer this advice: if you can imagine it, chances are some marketer somewhere already has.","Facebook allowing Cambridge Analytica to scrape its app and then use that data for what appears to be particularly insidious political marketing communications, isn’t some random oversight or an accidental breach of well established user trust.

There is nothing neo about Arthur Jones. Not just a white supremacist, not merely a foot soldier of the alt-right, Jones is the sort of full-on, unreconstructed, Holocaust-denying (“the blackest lie in history”), Hitler-worshiping, blood-and-soil warrior for whom the Jews are the root of all evil. Don’t panic. He will lose the election in an overwhelmingly Democratic district, but it is precisely that assumed outcome which seemed to have persuaded local Republicans not to bother opposing him in the March 20 primary. Waking up to the result of their indifference they belatedly repudiated Jones. But it might have occurred to them that the mere fact of his appearance on the ballot as the Republican candidate is itself a shocking affront not just to Jews but to all the norms of American political decency. Then again, those norms right now are shifting sand.","The sick joke of Jones’s candidacy doesn’t feature in Jonathan Weisman’s “(((Semitism))),” but every other kind of monstrously reawakened zombie-Nazi madness does, especially those swarming and multiplying in the digital dung heap. His book is largely a report from consternation nation, and its longest chapter chronicles the rise of white supremacist aggression, on and off the web. He has been on the sharp end of trolling storms and knows what it feels like (as do I) to have yourself photoshopped with concentration camp stripes or with your head in an oven. But in the end Weisman is unsure how much of an actual and immediate danger this online abuse represents. For all of the website bile and the tiki-torch marches, “the threat of violence against Jews,” he writes, “has not materialized into actual violence,” especially in comparison with hate crimes committed against African-Americans and Muslims. He quotes the Anti-Defamation League’s Jonathan Greenblatt saying that “the number of Americans that hold anti-Semitic beliefs has decreased dramatically.”","But of course it is the advent of Trumpian politics — its nonstop carnival of paranoia; its scapegoating of Hispanics and African-Americans; its anti-immigrant phobia — that has rung Weisman’s alarm bells, which accounts for his subtitle: “Being Jewish in America in the Age of Trump.” More sinister for him than the foaming lunacies of the neo-Nazis is the alt-right’s embrace of conspiracy theorists; the routine mutation of fantasy into fact; the appetite for seeing secret hands (George Soros for instance) at work in plots to undermine America — all of which have a whiff of late Weimar about them, not to mention the long history of populist anti-Semitism in the United States. Better, Weisman believes, to be fretfully vigilant than torpidly complacent. In one of the 1940s movie-poster homilies he favors (“the world is watching,” “the nation gasped”), he warns that while “unheard thunder” was rumbling, “the Jews slept.”","Image","But this reduction of “being Jewish” to a state of hair-tearing anxiety about the surge of anti-Semitism means Weisman never quite delivers on his subtitle’s promise. A richly researched and nuanced account of Jewish life in stressed-out, polarized America would be timely, but this isn’t it. Instead, Weisman takes a chapter to complain about what he considers the major distraction preventing American Jews from being fully alert to the perils of the time — but this, a little surprisingly, turns out to be “Israel, Israel, Israel.” It is not clear whether he thinks the AIPAC herd mentality, so elated at gestures like the embassy move to Jerusalem, blinkers Jews to the threat that Trump and Trumpism represent to the liberal culture he champions. Or whether he believes that increasingly abrasive debates dividing the Jewish community about the occupation of the West Bank and the expansion of settlements are the greater problem. Weisman reports with understandable pain his demonization by hard-liners as a self-hating Jewish traitor for daring to point out, in a Times infographic, which opponents of the Iranian nuclear deal were Jewish. But such bitter arguments have gone on for a while and it seems odd to suppose that engagement with the trials and tribulations of Israel somehow precludes engaging with diaspora anti-Semitism, as if Jews of all people have a finite capacity for attentiveness. Anti-Semitism and the existence of Israel are hardly historically disconnected.","The second malaise Weisman identifies as blunting Jewish alertness to the peril of the times is the hollowing out of a Jewish identity that is neither uncritically Zionist nor devoutly religious. “The Jews who are most interested in a liberal, internationalist future, who wish to live progressive, assimilated existences free of threat,” he warns, “are disappearing.” But his sense of the tradition he believes is being lost is romantically wishful. In a hasty drive through Jewish history he nominates Moses Maimonides and Moses Mendelssohn as embodying this outward-looking nontribal Judaism. But the two Moseses were intensely devout and at times darkly pessimistic about the prospects of a Jewish life in a non-Jewish world.","It is true nonetheless, as Weisman points out, that a considerable majority of Americans identifying as Jews do so by way of remembering the Holocaust or being engaged with the fate of Israel rather than anything much rooted in Judaism and Jewish history. Weisman confesses he isn’t “much into davening” and reckons that even efforts to introduce more Hebrew into the Reform liturgy is a matter of simply “going through the motions,” ultimately more impediment than inspiration. But if “being Jewish” means nothing more than an ethically attuned solidarity with kindred disadvantaged at home and abroad, then the reawakening he wants will just evaporate in a cloud of airy good will. Being Jewish is knowing Jewish history in some depth; being Jewish is engaging with the incomparable treasury of disputation that is the Talmud; being Jewish is immersion in the boundless glories of Jewish literature, poetry, philosophy and art.","It’s this broad-minded debate-conscious kind of Jewish life that Weisman worries is moribund. But it may be too soon to write its obituary. Annual Limmud retreats, which offer a festival of learning and discussion on all things truly or even notionally Jewish, are thriving in Britain and increasingly in America. Jewish journalism in magazines like Moment and Tablet alongside reinvigorated institutions like The Forward and The British Jewish Quarterly Review seems to be entering something of a golden age. In London, JW3 — since its opening in a spankingly smart modern building — has become a magnet of cultural energy, and Jewish Book Week (also in London) draws packed houses (and not exclusively Jewish audiences) to its offerings in early March. And if it is acts of solidarity Weisman wants (those have never really gone away) he might note that the home page of the American Jewish World Service for Purim featured a photograph of a Rohingya refugee.","None of this is to make light of the sinister anti-Semitic strain in the ascendancy of alt-right ideology. There are plenty of signs that Jew-hatred is pushing through the soft walls of ultraright politics and poisoning its bloodstream. There is nothing wrong, as Weisman counsels, with Jews standing shoulder to shoulder with those most damaged and threatened by tribalist populism, as Jews like Abraham Joshua Heschel did in the heyday of the civil rights movement. Ultimately, though, what is needed is an aggressive defense of those things that not so long ago could be taken for granted in America, and under which Jewish life has prospered to a degree unique in the world: the integrity of the democratic process, the protections of the Constitution and the preservation of the ideal of a “nation of immigrants,” a phrase just deleted from the Immigration Service’s mission statement. And a little davening now and then wouldn’t do any harm.","Simon Schama is the author, most recently, of the second volume of “The Story of the Jews.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

This was not a data breach, as Facebook made it clear in its response. Instead, developers figured out how to grab relevant data from around 50 million US voters and use that data to try to sway the elections.","Mark Zuckerberg is conspicuously absent from all of this, which adds a further dimension to the seriousness of the matter.","This is precisely the kind of meaningful story you’d want to share with people, including customers who may worry about the security of their data, investors looking to dump the stock, or regulators investigating this mess and potentially devising ways to regulate Facebook.","Zuckerberg has not issued a single statement on the matter. He didn’t come out to try to defend his company, as you’d expect from the CEO of the most popular social network in the world. He did not have a lengthy personal essay published on his wall either, which is the Zuckerberg way to respond to plenty of Facebook-related matters.","Zuckerberg is hiding, and this doesn’t look good for the company. Since the Cambridge Analytica revelations were made, Facebook stock on Monday dipped 10% below its February 1st highs, taking other tech companies along for the ride. The Dow dropped 335 points on Monday, per CNBC as a result.\nWhere are you, Mark?","So far, we’ve heard from Paul Grewal, who wrote Facebook’s blog post announcing the suspension of Cambridge Analytica and SCL from Facebook.","The name of Alex Stamos also came up. According to Ars Technica, Facebook’s chief information security officer was rumored to leave the company after disagreements with Facebook execs including COO Sheryl Sandberg about how to investigate the Russian activity on Facebook. Stamos later said that he would not leave Facebook, but shift priorities to “spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”","Stamos, by the way, is the same security expert who quit Yahoo in the wake of the great hacks that hit the company years ago. At the time, it was rumored that Stamos disagreed with top execs on Yahoo security. Maybe the next person that hires Stamos should really listen to what this guy has to say.","Where are you, Mark?","Facebook is getting ready for an open meeting on Tuesday, according to The Verge’s information, which will be streamed to all international Facebook employees as well.","However, Zuckerberg will not address the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Instead, Grewal will explain what happened, and the meeting isn’t supposed to last longer than 30 minutes.","Zuckerberg is apparently facing criticism from his own employees for staying silent, as he’s scheduled to speak at the company’s all-hands meeting on Friday. “The prevailing sentiment is, why haven’t we heard from Mark?” the employee said.

But for me the most consequential story of late was that a self-driving car operated by Uber — with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel — struck and tragically killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz.","I could only look at that deeply unsettling story and say: Welcome to the second inning — the second inning of one of the world’s great technological leaps, the implications of which we’re just beginning to understand.","But first, let’s acknowledge one thing: The first inning was amazing.","It was an inning full of promise, discovery and marvel. In the early 2000s, a set of technologies came together into platforms, social networks and software that made connectivity and solving complex problems fast, virtually free, easy for you, ubiquitous and invisible. Suddenly, more individuals could compete, connect, collaborate and create with more other people, in more ways, from more places, for less money and with greater ease than ever before. And we sure did!","We became our own filmmakers and reporters; we launched political and social revolutions from our living rooms; we connected with long-lost family and friends; we found the answers to old and new questions with one click; we searched for everything from spouses to news to directions to kindred spirits with our phones; we exposed dictators and branded ourselves. With one touch, we could suddenly call a taxi, direct a taxi, rate a taxi and pay a taxi — or rent an igloo, rate an igloo and pay for an igloo in Alaska.","And then, just as suddenly, we found ourselves in the second inning. The cool self-driving car killed a pedestrian; the cool Facebook platform enabled Russian troll farms to divide us and inject fake news into our public life; the uncool totalitarian government learned how to use the same facial recognition tools that can ease your way through passport control to single you out in a crowd for arrest.","And Mark Zuckerberg, who promised to connect us all — and that it would all be good — found himself on the cover of Wired magazine, with his face cut, bruised and bandaged, as if he’d been hit by a fastball. He wasn’t alone. In inning two, we started to feel beat up by the same platforms and technologies that had enriched, empowered and connected our lives.","Silicon Valley, we have a problem.","What to do? For problems like this, I like to consult my teacher and friend Dov Seidman, CEO of LRN, which helps companies and leaders build ethical cultures, and the author of the book, “How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything.”","“The first inning’s prevailing ethos was that any technology that makes the world more open by connecting us or makes us more equal by empowering us individually must, in and of itself, be a force for good,” Seidman began. “But, in inning two, we are coming to grips with the reality that the power to make the world more open and equal is not in the technologies themselves. It all depends on how the tools are designed and how we choose to use them. The same amazing tech that enables people to forge deeper relationships, foster closer communities and give everyone a voice can also breed isolation, embolden racists, and empower digital bullies and nefarious actors.”","Equally important, Seidman added, these “unprecedented and valuable tools of connection” are being used with great accuracy and potency “to assault the foundations of what makes our democracies vibrant, capitalism dynamic and our societies healthy — namely, truth and trust.”","And they have begun to be used “to assault our personal foundations — our privacy and sense of identity,” Seidman said: “It is one thing to use our data to enable better shopping experiences, but when my beliefs and attitudes are mined and manipulated for someone’s political campaign, a campaign that may be antithetical to my beliefs, that is deeply harmful and unmooring.” So what to do? “Precisely because we are in just the beginning of a technological revolution with a long, uncertain, up-and-down road ahead, we need to start by pausing to reflect on how our world, reshaped by these technologies, operates differently — and on the kind of values and leadership we will need to realize their promise.”","Values are more vital now than ever, Seidman insisted. “Because sustainable values are what anchor us in a storm, and because values propel and guide us when our lives are profoundly disrupted. They help us make the hard decisions.” Hard decisions abound, because everything is now connected. “The world is fused. So there no place anymore to stand to the side and claim neutrality — to say, ‘I am just a businessperson’ or ‘I am just running a platform.’ ”","No way. “Once you see that your technologies are having unintended consequences, you cannot maintain your neutrality — especially when you’ve become so central to the lives of billions of people.”","In the fused world, Seidman said, “the business of business is no longer just business. The business of business is now society. And, therefore, how you take or don’t take responsibility for what your technology enables or for what happens on your platforms is inescapable. This is the emerging expectation of users — real people — who’ve entrusted so much of their inner lives to these powerful companies.”","To be sure, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should all be commended for trying to find engineering solutions to prevent them from being hacked and weaponized.","“But this is not just an engineering problem, or just a business model problem,” he said. “Software solutions can increase our confidence that we can stay a step ahead of the bad guys. But, fundamentally, it will take more ‘moralware’ to regain our trust. Only one kind of leadership can respond to this kind of problem — moral leadership.”","What does moral leadership look like here?","“Moral leadership means truly putting people first and making whatever sacrifices that entails,” said Seidman. “That means not always competing on shallow things and quantity — on how much time people spend on your platform — but on quality and depth. It means seeing and treating people not just as ‘users’ or ‘clicks,’ but as ‘citizens,’ who are worthy of being accurately informed to make their best choices. It means not just trying to shift people from one click to another, from one video to another, but instead trying to elevate them in ways that deepen our connections and enrich our conversations.”","It means, Seidman continued, being “fully transparent about how you operate, and make decisions that affect them — all the ways in which you’re monetizing their data. It means having the courage to publish explicit standards of quality and expectations of conduct, and fighting to maintain them however inconvenient. It means having the humility to ask for help even from your critics. It means promoting civility and decency, making the opposite unwelcome. It means being truly bold — proclaiming, for example, that you will not sleep until you’re certain that our next democratic election won’t be hacked.”","At the height of the Cold War, when the world was threatened by spreading Communism and rising walls, President John F. Kennedy vowed to “pay any price and bear any burden” to ensure the success of liberty.","Today, falling walls and spreading webs — which criminals and nations can use to poison democratic societies — are becoming the biggest threat to the success of liberty. You will know that the good guys are winning when you see big tech companies rise to Kennedy’s challenge — to pay any price and bear any burden to protect us from the downsides of the technologies they’ve created."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

A message appeared saying she needed to download Facebook’s malware scanner if she wanted to get back in. Charity couldn’t use Facebook until she completed the scan, but the file the company provided was for a Windows device—Charity uses a Mac.","“I could not actually run the software they were demanding I download and use,” she says. When she tried instead to log in from her computer at work, Facebook greeted her with the same roadblock. “Obviously there is no way for Facebook to know if my device is infected with anything, since this same message appeared on any computer I tried to access my account from,” says Charity.","A Facebook spokesperson said Charity may have been asked to download the wrong software because some malware can spoof what kind of computer a person is running. Still, Charity was left without any way to access her account. And her experience is far from unique.","Scantron","The internet is full of Facebook users frustrated with how the company handles malware threats. For nearly four years, people have complained about Facebook's anti-malware scan on forums, Twitter, Reddit, and on personal blogs. The problems appear to have gotten worse recently. While the service used to be optional, Facebook now requires it if it flags your device for malware. And according to screenshots reviewed by WIRED from people recently prompted to run the scan, Facebook also no longer allows every user to select what type of device they're on, which ostensibly would have prevented what happened to Charity.","'I could not actually run the software they were demanding I download and use.'","Charity, Facebook User","The malware scans likely only impact a relatively small population of Facebook's billions of users, some of whose computers may genuinely be infected. But even a fraction of Facebook's users still potentially means millions of impacted people. The mandatory scan has caused widespread confusion and frustration; WIRED spoke to people who had been locked out of their accounts by the scan, or simply baffled by it, on four different continents.","The mandatory malware scan has downsides beyond losing account access. Facebook users also frequently report that the feature is poorly designed, and inconsistently implemented. In some cases, if a different user logs onto Facebook from the same device, they sometimes won’t be greeted with the malware message. Similarly, if the “infected” user simply switches browsers, the message also appears to occasionally go away.","“It is actually tied to one specific Facebook user on one specific browser—if I change either to a different account, or use Safari instead of Chrome with the locked-out account, I do not get the scanner dialog,” says Anatol Ulrich, a Facebook user from Germany who was locked out of his account after sharing several Google docs in comment threads on Facebook. He, too, was prompted to download a Windows file on a Mac device.","“Our visibility into each account on a given device isn’t complete enough for us to checkpoint based only on the device, without factoring in whether the particular account is acting in a suspicious manner,” Facebook spokesperson Jay Nancarrow said in a statement. In some ways that might be comforting; Facebook doesn't collect enough information about your computer to say whether malware has infected it.","But if Facebook doesn't know for sure, why would it push you to clean your device? Antivirus software is a powerful tool, capable of accessing nearly everything on your computer. Some users might reasonably not want to give Facebook and its chosen cybersecurity partners that level of access. Antivirus and anti-malware software are also prone to vulnerabilities themselves; in 2016, Google’s Travis Ormandy discovered critical flaws across all of Symantec’s antivirus products, for example.","This is what Facebook's malware scanner looks like when presented to a user.","Facebook","Facebook also doesn’t appear to have regularly updated its users about which partners it relies on to supply its malware scans. The social network began integrating the scans into its malware detection systems in May of 2014, and said they would be supplied by F-Secure and Trend Micro, according to the announcement blog post written at the time. In December of 2014, it added ESET, and in 2015, Facebook announced it was also adding Kaspersky Lab.","Facebook stopped working with Kaspersky last year, following reports that Russia exploited the company's antivirus software to trawl US government systems for classified data. F-Secure says it also stopped working with Facebook last year, but the social media platform never announced the change. “Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will update our documentation to reflect the current set of companies,” Nancarrow said in a statement.","Both ESET and Trend Micro say that they continue to work with Facebook, but stressed that they had no control over how the social network handles its scanning feature. “ESET does not have any ability to lock users out of their Facebook account, or unlock someone’s account. We recommend that people contact Facebook support for help if they experience this issue,” a spokesperson for ESET said in a statement.","No Transparency","Even with legitimate software partners, though, Facebook's malware-scanner notification could encourage unsafe behavior elsewhere on the web. It \"will possibly train users to accept or install fake antivirus products, most of which are ransomware,\" says Mohammad Mannan, a security researcher at Concordia University who has studied antivirus vulnerabilities. \"That is, you visit a random site, and get a scary popup which says your machine is infected and needs immediate cleaning; if you say yes to the installation, a ransom is asked.\"","At least one person, New Zealand businessman Jack Yan, even reported that running Facebook’s malware detector caused his own antivirus to disappear in 2016. Facebook declined to comment on the record about why this may have happened. It's possible the Kaspersky Lab antivirus software that Facebook mandated Yan use may have automatically deleted a number of other programs on his machine. After the incident, Yan penned a blog post describing his experience, which has since attracted a number of Facebook users who have experienced similar annoyances.","“Most of the folks who I have spoken to over the last couple of years have all said their systems were clean, and used their own virus and malware detectors,” says Yan. “Mine was confirmed clean at the time too.”","'Facebook should make their agreements with antivirus partners public.'","Mohammad Mannan, Concordia University","Facebook declined to say how many users see the malware scanner prompt, possibly because it doesn't actually know. When the social media company stopped working with Kaspersky, it said it was “unable to easily reconstruct how many Facebook users downloaded Kaspersky software.” The only public figure is from a 2015 blog post, in which Facebook said it had “helped clean up more than two million people’s computers,” over the course of three months.","Facebook also hasn't provided information about how it uses the data it gleams from its cybersecurity partners that conduct the malware scans. \"What does Facebook collect from their antivirus partners?\" asks Mannan. \"An antivirus product can collect a lot of useful information from the user machine—telemetry data; beyond what Facebook gets through their website—and share it with Facebook. Facebook should make their agreements with antivirus partners public.\"","Facebook tells users when they agree to conduct the scan that the data collected in the process will be used \"to improve security on and off Facebook,\" which is vague. The company did not immediately respond to a followup request for comment about how exactly it uses the data it collects from conducting malware checks.","Facebook has legitimate reason to want to keep malware off its service. Scammers, hackers, and even would-be cryptocurrency miners have all targeted Facebook and Facebook Messenger. But if Facebook keeps forcing its malware scans on its users, it has to commit to more transparency as well."],"isopubdate":"2018-02-23"}

Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February.","“It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Mr. Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side.","Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew.","The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used.","Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.”","Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.","“The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Mr. Stamos tweeted.","The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data.","“Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.”","Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited.","“Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Mr. Albright said.","Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said.","This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers.","There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations.","On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter.","Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie.","By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports.","In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as “a curious and naïve 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica.","“I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.”","His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data.","Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting.","In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it.","Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said.","In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article.","Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California — called for investigations of the Facebook data leak.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,” said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee.","Correction:","An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Senator Amy Klobuchar on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is a Democratic member of the committee, not the ranking Democratic member. (The ranking Democrat is Senator Dianne Feinstein.)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

In its review of documents and records, Politico found that more resources—from helicopters to meals and personnel—were given to Texas in the first nine days of the storm response, despite the fact that conditions in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria were more dire. Funds were also allocated faster to Texas—with $141.8 million being approved for Harvey victims in the nine days after the storm versus $6.2 million for victims of Maria. The rebuilding effort has already started in Texas, while the Trump administration is reportedly “forcing [Puerto Rico] to take a huge gamble” on an “experimental funding system,” the outlet reported.

The company said that Facebook \"simply stole the BRG Methodology and passed it off as its own.\" BladeRoom notes that Facebook shared some of the ideas for the Swedish data center on the Open Compute Project blog and did not \"make any attempt to attribute or credit BRG for any of the elements of the innovative new approach\" that Facebook \"claimed\" it had developed.","Further Reading","BRG says it holds the intellectual property rights and trade secrets to what it termed are \"mission-critical modular buildings with complex mechanical and electrical components.\" Those buildings, according to the company, include industrial kitchens, hospitals, theaters, clean rooms, and data centers.","Facebook claimed that BRG didn't own the trade secrets that allegedly were used to build the Facebook data center in Sweden. US District Judge Edward Davila, however, balked at the assertion and said BRG has adequately stated a claim under the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act.","\"... Plaintiffs have allegedly employed several mechanisms to limit the public disclosure of confidential information,\" the judge ruled. \"Facebook’s challenge to BRG’s trade secret misappropriation claim based on lack of ownership is therefore rejected.\"","BRG claims it was \"essentially enticed\" to meet with Facebook in 2012 about a data center deal under false pretenses.

Facebook, however, argued that BRG didn't go far enough in trying to keep its so-called BladeRoom technology a secret.","\"Thus, though Facebook’s argument regarding voluntary disclosure is certainly appealing and may ultimately prevail depending on what is revealed through an investigation of the facts, plaintiffs’ theory that its efforts at secrecy were reasonable under the circumstances is plausible enough to overcome a motion to dismiss,\" the judge ruled.","The ruling means that there will be more discovery, or \"an investigation of the facts,\" as the judge said, between the litigants to develop a larger record about the allegations.

Three months later, agents knocked on his door.","A spokesman for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement has resigned, saying that he could no longer “bear the burden” of spreading falsehoods on behalf of the Trump administration.","The spokesman, James Schwab, who had worked for the agency’s San Francisco Division, told news outlets Monday that his decision was prompted by false statements made by the agency on Feb. 27 and repeated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week.","The statements criticized the mayor of Oakland, Libby Schaaf, for her decision last month to warn city residents that a raid by federal immigration agents targeting roughly 1,000 people was imminent. The agency’s deputy director, Thomas D. Homan, said that Ms. Schaaf’s warning had helped “864 criminal aliens and public safety threats” to evade capture in the raid.","Mr. Sessions, in a visit to California last week, condemned Ms. Schaaf, a Democrat, and echoed the agency, asserting that her actions had allowed hundreds to escape.","Mr. Schwab said in interviews, first with The San Francisco Chronicle and then with CNN, that he had been frustrated by the remarks, and had quit “because I didn’t want to perpetuate misleading facts.”","“I asked them to change the information,” he told The Chronicle, referring to the 864 people to whom the statement alluded. “I told them that the information was wrong, they asked me to deflect, and I didn’t agree with that. Then I took some time and I quit.”","He explained that the enforcement agency would have been unlikely to capture all of the roughly 1,000 undocumented immigrants in the area that it had targeted, and that it was incorrect to identify those who were not detained as threats to public safety.","“We were never going to pick up that many people,” he said. “To say that 100 percent are dangerous criminals on the street, or that those people weren’t picked up because of the misguided actions of the mayor, is just wrong.”","Mr. Schwab did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. He resigned last week, according to CNN.","“I just couldn’t bear the burden — continuing on as a representative of the agency and charged with upholding integrity, knowing that information was false,” he told CNN, adding that in his 16 years of experience in government he had never been asked to deflect when he knew something was inaccurate.","In a statement, Ms. Schaaf, whom President Trump criticized last week for alerting residents to the raid, praised Mr. Schwab “for speaking the truth while under intense pressure to lie.”","“Our democracy depends on public servants who act with integrity and hold transparency in the highest regard,” she added.","An official at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, briefed on the plans for the raid said last month that agents find only about 30 percent of their targets on average during large sweeps.","Mr. Schwab told CNN that he thought Ms. Schaaf’s actions were “misguided,” but that blaming her “for 800 dangerous people out there is just false.”","ICE responded to Mr. Schwab’s comments in a statement, saying, “Even one criminal alien on the street can put public safety at risk.”","“As Director Homan stated, while we can’t put a number on how many targets avoided arrest due to the mayor’s warning, it clearly had an impact,” the statement said. “While we disagree with Mr. Schwab on this issue, we appreciate his service and wish him well.”","“If anyone wants to have a public argument over precisely how many dangerous criminal aliens eluded arrest because of the mayor’s irresponsible actions, we are happy to have that debate,” Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said in a statement.","In a 2016 interview, Mr. Schwab told The Marion Press, his hometown paper in Michigan, that he joined the Army after high school and was deployed to Korea for four years.

But Facebook was already doing this surreptitiously on some Android devices until October 2017, exploiting the way an older Android API handled permissions.","[Update, March 25, 2018, 20:24 Eastern Time]: Facebook has responded to this and other reports regarding the collection of call and SMS data with a blog post that denies Facebook collected call data surreptitiously. The company also writes that it never sells the data and that users are in control of the data uploaded to Facebook. This \"fact check\" contradicts several details Ars found in analysis of Facebook data downloads and testimony from users who provided the data. More on the Facebook response is appended to the end of the original article below.","This past week, a New Zealand man was looking through the data Facebook had collected from him in an archive he had pulled down from the social networking site. While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered something distressing: Facebook also had about two years' worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone, including names, phone numbers, and the length of each call made or received.","This experience has been shared by a number of other Facebook users who spoke with Ars, as well as independently by us—my own Facebook data archive, I found, contained call-log data for a certain Android device I used in 2015 and 2016, along with SMS and MMS message metadata.","Calls I made to my office number to check my voicemail, and from my office number to find my phone, found in my Facebook data archive. In total, there were two years of call data, from the period I used my Blackphone as my primary phone.","To retrieve a .zip file of your Facebook data, go to the Settings page on Facebook and click the link circled in this screen shot.","In response to an email inquiry by Ars about this data gathering, a Facebook spokesperson replied, \"The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.\"","The spokesperson pointed out that contact uploading is optional and installation of the application explicitly requests permission to access contacts. And users can delete contact data from their profiles using a tool accessible via Web browser.","Further Reading","Facebook uses phone-contact data as part of its friend recommendation algorithm. And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android and Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for access to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But even if users didn't give that permission to Messenger, they may have given it inadvertently for years through Facebook's mobile apps—because of the way Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past. (For Facebook's instructions on turning off continuous contact uploading, go here. )","If you granted permission to read contacts during Facebook's installation on Android a few versions ago—specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)—that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. From Android 4.1 on, a single request from those applications would trigger two separate permission requests.","But until the \"Marshmallow\" version of Android, even with split permissions, all permissions could still be presented all at once, without users getting the option to decline them individually. So Facebook and other applications could continue to gain access to call and SMS data with a single request by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Starting with Marshmallow, users could toggle these permissions separately themselves. But as many as half of Android users worldwide remain on older versions of the operating system because of carrier restrictions on updates or other issues.","Apple iOS has never allowed access to call log data by third-party apps, overt or silently, so this sort of data acquisition was never possible.","Facebook provides a way for users to purge collected contact data from their accounts, but it's not clear if this deletes just contacts or if it also purges call and SMS metadata. After purging my contact data, my contacts and calls were still in the archive I downloaded the next day—likely because the archive was not regenerated for my new request. (Update: The cached archive was generated once and not updated on the second request. However, two days after a request to delete all contact data, the contacts were still listed by the contact management tool.)","As always, if you're really concerned about privacy, you should not share address book and call-log data with any mobile application. And you may want to examine the rest of what can be found in the downloadable Facebook archive, as it includes all the advertisers that Facebook has shared your contact information with, among other things.","Update, March 25, 2018, continued:","Facebook responded to reports that it collected phone and SMS data without users' knowledge in a \"fact check\" blog post on Sunday. In the response, a Facebook spokesperson stated:","Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provide you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.","This contradicts the experience of several users who shared their data with Ars. Dylan McKay told Ars that he installed Messenger in 2015, but only allowed the app the permissions in the Android manifest that were required for installation. He says he removed and reinistalled the app several times over the course of the next few years, but never explicitly gave the app permission to read his SMS records and call history. McKay's call and SMS data runs through July of 2017.","In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used. Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.","While data collection was technically \"opt-in,\" in both these cases the opt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook's application, not a separate notification of data collection. Facebook never explicitly revealed that the data was being collected, and it was only discovered as part of a review of the data associated with the accounts. The users we talked to only performed such reviews after the recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data.","Facebook began explicitly asking permission from users of Messenger and Facebook Lite to access SMS and call data to \"help friends find each other\" after being publicly shamed in 2016 over the way it handled the \"opt-in\" for SMS services. That message mentioned nothing about retaining SMS and call data, but instead it offered an \"OK\" button to approve \"keeping all of your SMS messages in one place.\"","Facebook says that the company keeps the data secure and does not sell it to third parties. But the post doesn't address why it would be necessary to retain not just the numbers of contacts from phone calls and SMS messages, but the date, time, and length of those calls for years.","Sean Gallagher\nSean is Ars Technica's IT and National Security Editor.

Call logs are an entirely different matter and they knowingly misled Android users for years on this and did it quietly without their permission to boot.","This is no different from the tactics of the hundreds of spyware apps on the Play Store, the lengths that Facebook will go to to obtain your data know no bounds.","There isn't even an option to remove Facebook from a lot of devices. I know I've never had a Facebook account and yet I know the battery monitor occasionally flags the Facebook app for draining battery life on my phone. And I know it uses cellular data occasionally and probably wifi more liberally. So the app is obviously running and doing something on my phone. Half the web pages I visit also have Facebook tracking code embedded.","What I'd like to know is how I can have a conversation with someone and coincidentally my ads and search suggestions are eerily related to what I was just talking about.","There's a more-common-than-you'd-expect thing where people see (but ignore) an ad for something and get \"incepted\" so that later, whatever was in that ad comes to mind. Later they end up talking about if it's something they care about, and then only afterwards does the ad register in their conscious mind when it scrolls by a second time.","Stuff like this really makes me wish Android had native support for container-like silos, where you could just give each app a new set of contacts/texts/nearby wifi hotspots/whatever it so desires to spy on you with, and only by explicitly approving each limit set of things could you give it access to your real data.","Right now Android's bulk permission system of \"This app would like to be able to launch the phone dialer from the app. Would you like to grant it this permission along with reading your entire call log, voicemail status, and active phone calls?\" isn't good.","Edit: To be clear this is already possible with xPrivacy, but that depends on installing Xposed Framework, a set of system-level hooks that bypass basically all of Android security (mostly to install mods that deal with system-level things, like denying data to apps here).","Heads up. The Facebook Lite app version 40.0.0.5.68 doesn't have all all that intrusiveness. I stopped updating it the moment the Google Play app showed me the newer version demanded access to everything on my phone.","EDIT: On second thought, I rechecked the permits it already has.

As we and others have reported, Cambridge Analytica ultimately partnered with the Donald Trump campaign to leverage the data of millions of Facebook users to target them with advertisements and campaign material. The original investigation into Cambridge Analytica, published on Motherboard in January 2017 and in German in Das Magazin in December 2016, follows below.","On November 9 at around 8.30 AM., Michal Kosinski woke up in the Hotel Sunnehus in Zurich. The 34-year-old researcher had come to give a lecture at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) about the dangers of Big Data and the digital revolution. Kosinski gives regular lectures on this topic all over the world. He is a leading expert in psychometrics, a data-driven sub-branch of psychology. When he turned on the TV that morning, he saw that the bombshell had exploded: contrary to forecasts by all leading statisticians, Donald J. Trump had been elected president of the United States.","For a long time, Kosinski watched the Trump victory celebrations and the results coming in from each state. He had a hunch that the outcome of the election might have something to do with his research. Finally, he took a deep breath and turned off the TV.","On the same day, a then little-known British company based in London sent out a press release: \"We are thrilled that our revolutionary approach to data-driven communication has played such an integral part in President-elect Trump's extraordinary win,\" Alexander James Ashburner Nix was quoted as saying. Nix is British, 41 years old, and CEO of Cambridge Analytica. He is always immaculately turned out in tailor-made suits and designer glasses, with his wavy blonde hair combed back from his forehead. His company wasn't just integral to Trump's online campaign, but to the UK's Brexit campaign as well.","Of these three players—reflective Kosinski, carefully groomed Nix and grinning Trump—one of them enabled the digital revolution, one of them executed it and one of them benefited from it.","How dangerous is big data?","Anyone who has not spent the last five years living on another planet will be familiar with the term Big Data. Big Data means, in essence, that everything we do, both on and offline, leaves digital traces. Every purchase we make with our cards, every search we type into Google, every movement we make when our mobile phone is in our pocket, every \"like\" is stored. Especially every \"like.\" For a long time, it was not entirely clear what use this data could have—except, perhaps, that we might find ads for high blood pressure remedies just after we've Googled \"reduce blood pressure.\"","On November 9, it became clear that maybe much more is possible. The company behind Trump's online campaign—the same company that had worked for Leave.EU in the very early stages of its \"Brexit\" campaign—was a Big Data company: Cambridge Analytica.","To understand the outcome of the election—and how political communication might work in the future—we need to begin with a strange incident at Cambridge University in 2014, at Kosinski's Psychometrics Center.","Psychometrics, sometimes also called psychographics, focuses on measuring psychological traits, such as personality. In the 1980s, two teams of psychologists developed a model that sought to assess human beings based on five personality traits, known as the \"Big Five.\" These are: openness (how open you are to new experiences?), conscientiousness (how much of a perfectionist are you?), extroversion (how sociable are you?), agreeableness (how considerate and cooperative you are?) and neuroticism (are you easily upset?). Based on these dimensions—they are also known as OCEAN, an acronym for openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, neuroticism—we can make a relatively accurate assessment of the kind of person in front of us. This includes their needs and fears, and how they are likely to behave. The \"Big Five\" has become the standard technique of psychometrics. But for a long time, the problem with this approach was data collection, because it involved filling out a complicated, highly personal questionnaire. Then came the Internet. And Facebook. And Kosinski.","Michal Kosinski was a student in Warsaw when his life took a new direction in 2008. He was accepted by Cambridge University to do his PhD at the Psychometrics Centre, one of the oldest institutions of this kind worldwide. Kosinski joined fellow student David Stillwell (now a lecturer at Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge) about a year after Stillwell had launched a little Facebook application in the days when the platform had not yet become the behemoth it is today. Their MyPersonality app enabled users to fill out different psychometric questionnaires, including a handful of psychological questions from the Big Five personality questionnaire (\"I panic easily,\" \"I contradict others\"). Based on the evaluation, users received a \"personality profile\"—individual Big Five values—and could opt-in to share their Facebook profile data with the researchers.","Followers of Lady Gaga were most probably extroverts, while those who \"liked\" philosophy tended to be introverts.","Kosinski had expected a few dozen college friends to fill in the questionnaire, but before long, hundreds, thousands, then millions of people had revealed their innermost convictions. Suddenly, the two doctoral candidates owned the largest dataset combining psychometric scores with Facebook profiles ever to be collected.","The approach that Kosinski and his colleagues developed over the next few years was actually quite simple. First, they provided test subjects with a questionnaire in the form of an online quiz. From their responses, the psychologists calculated the personal Big Five values of respondents. Kosinski's team then compared the results with all sorts of other online data from the subjects: what they \"liked,\" shared or posted on Facebook, or what gender, age, place of residence they specified, for example. This enabled the researchers to connect the dots and make correlations.","Remarkably reliable deductions could be drawn from simple online actions. For example, men who \"liked\" the cosmetics brand MAC were slightly more likely to be gay; one of the best indicators for heterosexuality was \"liking\" Wu-Tang Clan. Followers of Lady Gaga were most probably extroverts, while those who \"liked\" philosophy tended to be introverts. While each piece of such information is too weak to produce a reliable prediction, when tens, hundreds, or thousands of individual data points are combined, the resulting predictions become really accurate.","Kosinski and his team tirelessly refined their models. In 2012, Kosinski proved that on the basis of an average of 68 Facebook \"likes\" by a user, it was possible to predict their skin color (with 95 percent accuracy), their sexual orientation (88 percent accuracy), and their affiliation to the Democratic or Republican party (85 percent). But it didn't stop there. Intelligence, religious affiliation, as well as alcohol, cigarette and drug use, could all be determined. From the data it was even possible to deduce whether someone's parents were divorced.","The strength of their modeling was illustrated by how well it could predict a subject's answers. Kosinski continued to work on the models incessantly: before long, he was able to evaluate a person better than the average work colleague, merely on the basis of ten Facebook \"likes.\" Seventy \"likes\" were enough to outdo what a person's friends knew, 150 what their parents knew, and 300 \"likes\" what their partner knew. More \"likes\" could even surpass what a person thought they knew about themselves. On the day that Kosinski published these findings, he received two phone calls. The threat of a lawsuit and a job offer. Both from Facebook.","Michal Kosinski. Courtesy of Kosinski","Only weeks later Facebook \"likes\" became private by default. Before that, the default setting was that anyone on the internet could see your \"likes.\" But this was no obstacle to data collectors: while Kosinski always asked for the consent of Facebook users, many apps and online quizzes today require access to private data as a precondition for taking personality tests. (Anybody who wants to evaluate themselves based on their Facebook \"likes\" can do so on Kosinski's website, and then compare their results to those of a classic Ocean questionnaire, like that of the Cambridge Psychometrics Center.)","Our smartphone, Kosinski concluded, is a vast psychological questionnaire that we are constantly filling out, both consciously and unconsciously.","But it was not just about \"likes\" or even Facebook: Kosinski and his team could now ascribe Big Five values based purely on how many profile pictures a person has on Facebook, or how many contacts they have (a good indicator of extraversion). But we also reveal something about ourselves even when we're not online. For example, the motion sensor on our phone reveals how quickly we move and how far we travel (this correlates with emotional instability). Our smartphone, Kosinski concluded, is a vast psychological questionnaire that we are constantly filling out, both consciously and unconsciously.","Above all, however—and this is key—it also works in reverse: not only can psychological profiles be created from your data, but your data can also be used the other way round to search for specific profiles: all anxious fathers, all angry introverts, for example—or maybe even all undecided Democrats? Essentially, what Kosinski had invented was sort of a people search engine. He started to recognize the potential—but also the inherent danger—of his work.","To him, the internet had always seemed like a gift from heaven. What he really wanted was to give something back, to share. Data can be copied, so why shouldn't everyone benefit from it? It was the spirit of a whole generation, the beginning of a new era that transcended the limitations of the physical world. But what would happen, wondered Kosinski, if someone abused his people search engine to manipulate people? He began to add warnings to most of his scientific work. His approach, he warned, \"could pose a threat to an individual's well-being, freedom, or even life.\" But no one seemed to grasp what he meant.","Around this time, in early 2014, Kosinski was approached by a young assistant professor in the psychology department called Aleksandr Kogan. He said he was inquiring on behalf of a company that was interested in Kosinski's method, and wanted to access the MyPersonality database. Kogan wasn't at liberty to reveal for what purpose; he was bound to secrecy.","At first, Kosinski and his team considered this offer, as it would mean a great deal of money for the institute, but then he hesitated. Finally, Kosinski remembers, Kogan revealed the name of the company: SCL, or Strategic Communication Laboratories. Kosinski Googled the company: \"[We are] the premier election management agency,\" says the company's website. SCL provides marketing based on psychological modeling. One of its core focuses: Influencing elections. Influencing elections? Perturbed, Kosinski clicked through the pages. What kind of company was this? And what were these people planning?","What Kosinski did not know at the time: SCL is the parent of a group of companies. Who exactly owns SCL and its diverse branches is unclear, thanks to a convoluted corporate structure, the type seen in the UK Companies House, the Panama Papers, and the Delaware company registry. Some of the SCL offshoots have been involved in elections from Ukraine to Nigeria, helped the Nepalese monarch against the rebels, whereas others have developed methods to influence Eastern European and Afghan citizens for NATO. And, in 2013, SCL spun off a new company to participate in US elections: Cambridge Analytica.","Kosinski knew nothing about all this, but he had a bad feeling. \"The whole thing started to stink,\" he recalls. On further investigation, he discovered that Aleksandr Kogan had secretly registered a company doing business with SCL. According to a December 2015 report in The Guardian and to internal company documents given to Das Magazin, it emerges that SCL learned about Kosinski's method from Kogan.","Kosinski came to suspect that Kogan's company might have reproduced the Facebook \"Likes\"-based Big Five measurement tool in order to sell it to this election-influencing firm. He immediately broke off contact with Kogan and informed the director of the institute, sparking a complicated conflict within the university. The institute was worried about its reputation. Aleksandr Kogan then moved to Singapore, married, and changed his name to Dr. Spectre. Michal Kosinski finished his PhD, got a job offer from Stanford and moved to the US.","Mr. Brexit","All was quiet for about a year. Then, in November 2015, the more radical of the two Brexit campaigns, \"Leave.EU,\" supported by Nigel Farage, announced that it had commissioned a Big Data company to support its online campaign: Cambridge Analytica. The company's core strength: innovative political marketing—microtargeting—by measuring people's personality from their digital footprints, based on the OCEAN model.","After the Brexit result, friends and acquaintances wrote to him: Just look at what you've done.","Now Kosinski received emails asking what he had to do with it—the words Cambridge, personality, and analytics immediately made many people think of Kosinski. It was the first time he had heard of the company, which borrowed its name, it said, from its first employees, researchers from the university. Horrified, he looked at the website. Was his methodology being used on a grand scale for political purposes?","After the Brexit result, friends and acquaintances wrote to him: Just look at what you've done. Everywhere he went, Kosinski had to explain that he had nothing to do with this company. (It remains unclear how deeply Cambridge Analytica was involved in the Brexit campaign. Cambridge Analytica would not discuss such questions.)","For a few months, things are relatively quiet. Then, on September 19, 2016, just over a month before the US elections, the guitar riffs of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Bad Moon Rising\" fill the dark-blue hall of New York's Grand Hyatt hotel. The Concordia Summit is a kind of World Economic Forum in miniature. Decision-makers from all over the world have been invited, among them Swiss President Johann Schneider-Ammann. \"Please welcome to the stage Alexander Nix, chief executive officer of Cambridge Analytica,\" a smooth female voice announces. A slim man in a dark suit walks onto the stage. A hush falls. Many in attendance know that this is Trump's new digital strategy man. (A video of the presentation was posted on YouTube.)","A few weeks earlier, Trump had tweeted, somewhat cryptically, \"Soon you'll be calling me Mr. Brexit.\" Political observers had indeed noticed some striking similarities between Trump's agenda and that of the right-wing Brexit movement. But few had noticed the connection with Trump's recent hiring of a marketing company named Cambridge Analytica.","Alexander Nix. Image: Cambridge Analytica","\"Pretty much every message that Trump put out was data-driven,\" says Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix","Up to this point, Trump's digital campaign had consisted of more or less one person: Brad Parscale, a marketing entrepreneur and failed start-up founder who created a rudimentary website for Trump for $1,500. The 70-year-old Trump is not digitally savvy—there isn't even a computer on his office desk. Trump doesn't do emails, his personal assistant once revealed. She herself talked him into having a smartphone, from which he now tweets incessantly.","Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, relied heavily on the legacy of the first \"social-media president,\" Barack Obama. She had the address lists of the Democratic Party, worked with cutting-edge big data analysts from BlueLabs and received support from Google and DreamWorks. When it was announced in June 2016 that Trump had hired Cambridge Analytica, the establishment in Washington just turned up their noses. Foreign dudes in tailor-made suits who don't understand the country and its people? Seriously?","\"It is my privilege to speak to you today about the power of Big Data and psychographics in the electoral process.\" The logo of Cambridge Analytica— a brain composed of network nodes, like a map, appears behind Alexander Nix. \"Only 18 months ago, Senator Cruz was one of the less popular candidates,\" explains the blonde man in a cut-glass British accent, which puts Americans on edge the same way that a standard German accent can unsettle Swiss people. \"Less than 40 percent of the population had heard of him,\" another slide says. Cambridge Analytica had become involved in the US election campaign almost two years earlier, initially as a consultant for Republicans Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. Cruz—and later Trump—was funded primarily by the secretive US software billionaire Robert Mercer who, along with his daughter Rebekah, is reported to be the largest investor in Cambridge Analytica.","\"So how did he do this?\" Up to now, explains Nix, election campaigns have been organized based on demographic concepts. \"A really ridiculous idea. The idea that all women should receive the same message because of their gender—or all African Americans because of their race.\" What Nix meant is that while other campaigners so far have relied on demographics, Cambridge Analytica was using psychometrics.","Though this might be true, Cambridge Analytica's role within Cruz's campaign isn't undisputed. In December 2015 the Cruz team credited their rising success to psychological use of data and analytics. In Advertising Age, a political client said the embedded Cambridge staff was \"like an extra wheel,\" but found their core product, Cambridge's voter data modeling, still \"excellent.\" The campaign would pay the company at least $5.8 million to help identify voters in the Iowa caucuses, which Cruz won, before dropping out of the race in May.","Nix clicks to the next slide: five different faces, each face corresponding to a personality profile. It is the Big Five or OCEAN Model. \"At Cambridge,\" he said, \"we were able to form a model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.\" The hall is captivated. According to Nix, the success of Cambridge Analytica's marketing is based on a combination of three elements: behavioral science using the OCEAN Model, Big Data analysis, and ad targeting. Ad targeting is personalized advertising, aligned as accurately as possible to the personality of an individual consumer.","Nix candidly explains how his company does this. First, Cambridge Analytica buys personal data from a range of different sources, like land registries, automotive data, shopping data, bonus cards, club memberships, what magazines you read, what churches you attend. Nix displays the logos of globally active data brokers like Acxiom and Experian—in the US, almost all personal data is for sale. For example, if you want to know where Jewish women live, you can simply buy this information, phone numbers included. Now Cambridge Analytica aggregates this data with the electoral rolls of the Republican party and online data and calculates a Big Five personality profile. Digital footprints suddenly become real people with fears, needs, interests, and residential addresses.","The methodology looks quite similar to the one that Michal Kosinski once developed. Cambridge Analytica also uses, Nix told us, \"surveys on social media\" and Facebook data. And the company does exactly what Kosinski warned of: \"We have profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America—220 million people,\" Nix boasts.","He opens the screenshot. \"This is a data dashboard that we prepared for the Cruz campaign.\" A digital control center appears. On the left are diagrams; on the right, a map of Iowa, where Cruz won a surprisingly large number of votes in the primary. And on the map, there are hundreds of thousands of small red and blue dots. Nix narrows down the criteria: \"Republicans\"—the blue dots disappear; \"not yet convinced\"—more dots disappear; \"male\", and so on. Finally, only one name remains, including age, address, interests, personality and political inclination. How does Cambridge Analytica now target this person with an appropriate political message?","Alexander Nix at the 2016 Concordia Summit in New York. Image: Concordia Summit","Nix shows how psychographically categorized voters can be differently addressed, based on the example of gun rights, the 2nd Amendment: \"For a highly neurotic and conscientious audience the threat of a burglary—and the insurance policy of a gun.\" An image on the left shows the hand of an intruder smashing a window. The right side shows a man and a child standing in a field at sunset, both holding guns, clearly shooting ducks: \"Conversely, for a closed and agreeable audience. People who care about tradition, and habits, and family.\"","How to keep Clinton voters away from the ballot box","Trump's striking inconsistencies, his much-criticized fickleness, and the resulting array of contradictory messages, suddenly turned out to be his great asset: a different message for every voter. The notion that Trump acted like a perfectly opportunistic algorithm following audience reactions is something the mathematician Cathy O'Neil observed in August 2016.","These \"dark posts\"—sponsored Facebook posts that can only be seen by users with specific profiles—included videos aimed at African-Americans in which Hillary Clinton refers to black men as predators, for example.","\"Pretty much every message that Trump put out was data-driven,\" Alexander Nix remembers. On the day of the third presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, Trump's team tested 175,000 different ad variations for his arguments, in order to find the right versions above all via Facebook. The messages differed for the most part only in microscopic details, in order to target the recipients in the optimal psychological way: different headings, colors, captions, with a photo or video. This fine-tuning reaches all the way down to the smallest groups, Nix explained in an interview with us. \"We can address villages or apartment blocks in a targeted way. Even individuals.\"","In the Miami district of Little Haiti, for instance, Trump's campaign provided inhabitants with news about the failure of the Clinton Foundation following the earthquake in Haiti, in order to keep them from voting for Hillary Clinton. This was one of the goals: to keep potential Clinton voters (which include wavering left-wingers, African-Americans, and young women) away from the ballot box, to \"suppress\" their vote, as one senior campaign official told Bloomberg in the weeks before the election. These \"dark posts\"—sponsored news-feed-style ads in Facebook timelines that can only be seen by users with specific profiles—included videos aimed at African-Americans in which Hillary Clinton refers to black men as predators, for example.","Nix finishes his lecture at the Concordia Summit by stating that traditional blanket advertising is dead. \"My children will certainly never, ever understand this concept of mass communication.\" And before leaving the stage, he announced that since Cruz had left the race, the company was helping one of the remaining presidential candidates.","Just how precisely the American population was being targeted by Trump's digital troops at that moment was not visible, because they attacked less on mainstream TV and more with personalized messages on social media or digital TV. And while the Clinton team thought it was in the lead, based on demographic projections, Bloomberg journalist Sasha Issenberg was surprised to note on a visit to San Antonio—where Trump's digital campaign was based—that a \"second headquarters\" was being created. The embedded Cambridge Analytica team, apparently only a dozen people, received $100,000 from Trump in July, $250,000 in August, and $5 million in September. According to Nix, the company earned over $15 million overall. (The company is incorporated in the US, where laws regarding the release of personal data are more lax than in European Union countries. Whereas European privacy laws require a person to \"opt in\" to a release of data, those in the US permit data to be released unless a user \"opts out.\")","Groundgame, an app for election canvassing that integrates voter data with \"geospatial visualization technology,\" was used by campaigners for Trump and Brexit. Image: L2","The measures were radical: From July 2016, Trump's canvassers were provided with an app with which they could identify the political views and personality types of the inhabitants of a house. It was the same app provider used by Brexit campaigners. Trump's people only rang at the doors of houses that the app rated as receptive to his messages. The canvassers came prepared with guidelines for conversations tailored to the personality type of the resident. In turn, the canvassers fed the reactions into the app, and the new data flowed back to the dashboards of the Trump campaign.","Again, this is nothing new. The Democrats did similar things, but there is no evidence that they relied on psychometric profiling. Cambridge Analytica, however, divided the US population into 32 personality types, and focused on just 17 states. And just as Kosinski had established that men who like MAC cosmetics are slightly more likely to be gay, the company discovered that a preference for cars made in the US was a great indication of a potential Trump voter. Among other things, these findings now showed Trump which messages worked best and where. The decision to focus on Michigan and Wisconsin in the final weeks of the campaign was made on the basis of data analysis. The candidate became the instrument for implementing a big data model.","What's Next?","But to what extent did psychometric methods influence the outcome of the election? When asked, Cambridge Analytica was unwilling to provide any proof of the effectiveness of its campaign. And it is quite possible that the question is impossible to answer.","And yet there are clues: There is the fact of the surprising rise of Ted Cruz during the primaries. Also there was an increased number of voters in rural areas. There was the decline in the number of African-American early votes. The fact that Trump spent so little money may also be explained by the effectiveness of personality-based advertising. As does the fact that he invested far more in digital than TV campaigning compared to Hillary Clinton. Facebook proved to be the ultimate weapon and the best election campaigner, as Nix explained, and as comments by several core Trump campaigners demonstrate.","Cambridge Analytica counts among its clients the U.S. State Department, and has been reported to have communicated with British Prime Minister Theresa May, pictured here with Secretary of State John Kerry on July 19, 2016. Image: U.S. Dept. of State","Many voices have claimed that the statisticians lost the election because their predictions were so off the mark. But what if statisticians in fact helped win the election—but only those who were using the new method? It is an irony of history that Trump, who often grumbled about scientific research, used a highly scientific approach in his campaign.","Another big winner is Cambridge Analytica. Its board member Steve Bannon, former executive chair of the right-wing online newspaper Breitbart News, has been appointed as Donald Trump's senior counselor and chief strategist. Whilst Cambridge Analytica is not willing to comment on alleged ongoing talks with UK Prime Minister Theresa May, Alexander Nix claims that he is building up his client base worldwide, and that he has received inquiries from Switzerland, Germany, and Australia. His company is currently touring European conferences showcasing their success in the United States. This year three core countries of the EU are facing elections with resurgent populist parties: France, Holland and Germany. The electoral successes come at an opportune time, as the company is readying for a push into commercial advertising.","Kosinski has observed all of this from his office at Stanford. Following the US election, the university is in turmoil. Kosinski is responding to developments with the sharpest weapon available to a researcher: a scientific analysis. Together with his research colleague Sandra Matz, he has conducted a series of tests, which will soon be published. The initial results are alarming: The study shows the effectiveness of personality targeting by showing that marketers can attract up to 63 percent more clicks and up to 1,400 more conversions in real-life advertising campaigns on Facebook when matching products and marketing messages to consumers' personality characteristics. They further demonstrate the scalability of personality targeting by showing that the majority of Facebook Pages promoting products or brands are affected by personality and that large numbers of consumers can be accurately targeted based on a single Facebook Page.","In a statement after the German publication of this article, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said, \"Cambridge Analytica does not use data from Facebook. It has had no dealings with Dr. Michal Kosinski. It does not subcontract research. It does not use the same methodology. Psychographics was hardly used at all. Cambridge Analytica did not engage in efforts to discourage any Americans from casting their vote in the presidential election. Its efforts were solely directed towards increasing the number of voters in the election.\"","The world has been turned upside down. Great Britain is leaving the EU, Donald Trump is president of the United States of America. And in Stanford, Kosinski, who wanted to warn against the danger of using psychological targeting in a political setting, is once again receiving accusatory emails. \"No,\" says Kosinski, quietly and shaking his head. \"This is not my fault. I did not build the bomb. I only showed that it exists.\""],"isopubdate":"2017-01-28"}

Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.","Facebook’s share values plummeted immediately after the FTC announced its probe, but they rebounded later in the day, closing up a fraction of a point on a day when the overall market rose about 3 percent.","However, public opinion toward the company has not bounced back so easily, and the #deleteFacebook trend has continued to gain momentum. The movement even gained the support of WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who sold his company to Facebook for roughly $19 billion in 2014.","Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) finally broke his silence on the Cambridge Analytica scandal last week, saying that Facebook must “step up” and address its failures. “We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward,” Zuckerberg said.","Facebook denies logging calls and messages — sort of","Facebook eventually owned up to Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of user data, but the company has denied the more recent reports that it has been logging users’ call and SMS history without their permission. “This is not the case,” Facebook said in a statement.","To be clear, Facebook does actually log user calls and SMS history on its mobile apps, but the company has rejected the “without permission” element of last week’s reports.","“Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook,” Facebook said in its statement. “People have to expressly agree to use this feature.”","Although Facebook’s call logging feature is opt-in, the prompt given to users during installation offers a seemingly innocuous explanation for what the feature does. The prompt also features “TURN ON” as the more prominent choice, while the easily missed “NOT NOW” is displayed in the same faded gray color as the rest of the text. With the number of people who skip past terms-of-service agreements without ever reading them, it is possible that many users have the call logging feature turned unbeknownst to them.","Facebook assured users that it will never sell the data it has gathered from this feature, and the company noted that the feature “does not collect the content of your text messages or calls.” Facebook also said users can disable the logging feature at any time, which will delete “all previously shared call and text history shared via that app.”","Images: Facebook","Since you’re here …","… We’d like to tell you about our mission and how you can help us fulfill it.

The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","See the full visual","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick Guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","See the full visual","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

This is a company that took fake news to the next level.","Not only was that data used for microtargeting voters, Wiley claimed, but by tracking the response to those messages in real time on social media, the firm could advise the campaign where Trump should visit and what words would resonate most with voters in the region. In fact, Steve Bannon, former chief strategist for President Donald Trump and executive chairman of Breitbart News, told Bloomberg in late October of 2016, “I wouldn’t have come aboard, even for Trump, if I hadn’t known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine.

The company harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without permission, the New York Times reported.","It was a punishing day for other tech billionaires too. Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos lost $2.1 billion (all figures US) and the fortunes of Alphabet Inc. founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin each declined $1.5 billion as a technology selloff sent the Nasdaq indexes to the steepest losses in six weeks.","Facebook shares fell 6.8 per cent to $172.56, cutting Zuckerberg’s fortune to $70.4 billion and dropping him one place to fifth on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He’s now behind Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Amancio Ortega.","Facebook investors were making themselves heard, sending the stock to its biggest intra-day sell-off since September 2012. Lots of other people aired their grievances via Twitter.","A Bloomberg count of negative sentiment expressed on Twitter hit its highest level since Feb. 2, 2017, following reports that a political advertising firm retained information on millions of Facebook users without their consent. Tweet sentiment is measured by Bloomberg using proprietary analytics. It’s the fourth most negative day in the last four years for Facebook, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.","Despite all the political noise, it’s hard to see potential regulation seriously damaging the company’s dominance in online advertising, several analysts said.","“This is more ‘headline risk’ at this point and does not overly concern us,” Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, said in a note to clients. Ives maintained his buy rating on Facebook shares, saying any stock weakness related to “regulatory and political headline risk” could be an opportunity.","The Cambridge Analytica breach is the latest in a procession of controversies for the internet giant. Zuckerberg has pledged to “fix” the platform after revelations last year that Russian agents used it to try to influence the 2016 presidential election. There’s also a growing backlash among pundits and journalists suggesting Facebook divides people rather than accomplishing its original mission of bringing the world together. Politicians in the U.K. and U.S. have called for enhanced regulations and transparency, especially when it comes to political ads on the site.","The core value of Facebook is the trove of highly specific information it has on each of its users, which number 1.37 billion worldwide. It’s possible the site will become a less appealing place for advertisers if politicians enact strict rules on how that data can be used, Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at research firm EMarketer, said in an email.","“This specific incident is not likely to cause advertisers to leave Facebook, but it will cause them to think twice about how data about Facebook’s users is handled,” Aho Williamson said. “If Facebook were forced to change the way it uses data or the way its ad products work, then advertisers may become less enamoured with it.”","Still, when it comes to digital advertising, Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have a lock on the market. Together, the two companies accounted for 58.5 per cent of the U.S. market in 2017, according to EMarketer. That means advertisers have little choice but to spend on Facebook if they want to get their message out to the widest audience online.","“Facebook and Google still very much enjoy an advertising duopoly, and although engagement is arguably at risk, there are no real alternatives of scale,” James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt and Co., wrote in a note. “This is an unintended, yet unavoidable, byproduct of operating a platform with 30 per cent of the global population.”","This Week's Flyers","Comments","We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

{"originalurl":"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/hedge-fund-taxes-superpacs-election-renaissance/","title":"Why Are These Hedge Fund Kingpins Dumping Millions Into the Midterms? – Mother Jones","text":["Looking for news you can trust?Subscribe to our free newsletters.","As Democrats and Republicans battle for control of the Senate, hedge funds are dumping millions of dollars into congressional campaigns. Most of these companies are lining up behind one party or the other. But the second-biggest spender, Long Island-based Renaissance Technologies, is playing both sides of the aisle. As of early September, the firm’s CEO, Robert Mercer, had given $3.1 million to Republican candidates and super-PACs. Its founder and chairman, James Simons—a brilliant former National Security Agency code breaker—had donated $3.2 million to their Democratic counterparts.","Neither man has spoken publicly about his motives, but the donations coincide with at least two federal investigations into Renaissance’s business dealings. In July, Renaissance executives were hauled before a Senate subcommittee and grilled about the company’s use of complex financial instruments to dodge billions of dollars in taxes and skirt federal leverage limits, which protect the financial markets from swings and crashes. As Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) put it during the hearing, “excessive leverage” can “bring down not just a reckless borrower, but the financial institution that lent it money, and that failure can ripple through the entire financial system.”","The story of Simons’ evolution from math prodigy to NSA contractor to billionaire super-PAC donor reads like a Hollywood script. The son of a Massachusetts shoe factory owner, he graduated with a math degree from MIT when he was just 20 years old. Three years later, he earned a Ph.D. from the University of California-Berkeley, and returned to MIT, this time as a professor.","By 1964 Simons had moved on to the Princeton branch of the Institute for Defense Analyses, a nonprofit corporation that coordinates federally funded defense research at universities. His charge was to help the NSA crack Cold War code, but he locked horns with IDA’s president, Maxwell Taylor, a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. In 1967, Taylor published an article in the New York Times Magazine defending the US role in the Vietnam War. Simons, who was in his late 20s, dashed off a letter to the editor. “Some of us at the institution have a different view,” he wrote. “The only…rational defense policy is to withdraw with the greatest possible dispatch.”","Simons was later fired from IDA and took a job as chair of the math department at Stony Brook University. There, he earned a reputation as a big thinker. “His mind is open at a very wide angle,” says Jeff Cheeger, a professor of mathematics at New York University who served on the Stony Brook faculty with Simons. “He has an uncanny ability to pinpoint and solve problems that are of fundamental importance as opposed to just fashionable or obviously hard.”","Working with a renowned Berkeley geometer, Simons eventually created a new tool for gauging curved spaces, a development that would revolutionize theoretical physics and alter scientific understanding of everything from gravity to black holes. It also earned Simons the American Mathematics Society’s Veblen Prize, the world’s highest award for geometry.","After leaving Stony Brook in 1978, Simons launched an investment firm called Monemetrics in a Long Island strip mall. And four years later, he founded Renaissance. Working with a team of code breakers, programmers, and statistically minded science professors, Simons built a computerized system that scoured the markets for statistical anomalies, such as stocks that were trading below value. Returns were uneven, at least until Simons and his crew began experimenting with what is now known as high-frequency trading. They found it was far easier to predict how a given stock or commodity would move during the next few minutes or hours than to divine what would happen months down the track. Soon Renaissance was making thousands of trades each day and its flagship Medallion fund was delivering returns of 30 percent or more each year.","“Renaissance profited from this tax treatment by insisting on the fiction that it didn’t really own the stocks it traded,” said Sen. McCain.","Simons eventually closed Medallion to new investors and began spinning off other funds that were open to outsiders. In 1993, he brought on two brilliant linguists, Robert Mercer and Peter Brown, who had worked at IBM and had helped create groundbreaking new speech-recognition models based on mathematics. The pair threw themselves into refining Renaissance’s secret algorithms. Brown, whose wife, Margaret Hamburg, now heads the Food and Drug Administration, often slept on a Murphy bed in the office and rode a unicycle around the firm’s leafy Long Island campus to save time. By 2000, Renaissance had grown from a dozen employees to nearly 150, and its Medallion fund, which was mostly insider owned, was returning more than 90 percent per year. Simons, who ranks No. 37 on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans, bought a 220-foot superyacht called Archimedes and began taking his staff and their families on lavish vacations. One year, he reportedly flew hundreds of people to Bermuda for a weekend getaway. Mercer, then an executive vice president, built a $2 million model train set in the basement of his Long Island mansion. (He later sued the builder, claiming he’d been overcharged.)","Renaissance is notoriously secretive about its investment formula. But documents released by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in July offer some clues about the engine behind its growth. In 1999, Deutsche Bank—which did not respond to requests for comment—approached Renaissance and offered to package all of the Medallion fund’s investments into a portfolio, or “basket,” that was held in the bank’s name. Under this arrangement, Renaissance would still control the trades and reap all the profits (minus the bank’s generous fees). But it didn’t have to pay short-term capital gains taxes on the underlying assets, even if they were only held for a few hours or days. (Short-term gains are taxed at 39 percent for the highest earners; long-term gains are taxed at roughly half that rate.)","“Renaissance profited from this tax treatment by insisting on the fiction that it didn’t really own the stocks it traded—that the banks that Renaissance dealt with, did,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said during the recent hearing. “But, the fact is that Renaissance did all the trading, maintained full control over the account…and reaped all of the profits.”","The basket options also allowed Renaissance to skirt federal leverage limits. Normally, hedge funds can borrow a maximum of $2 for every $1 of their own capital they use to finance assets through brokerage accounts. But under its agreement with Deutsche Bank, Renaissance managed to borrow nearly 10 times that sum. It looked to outsiders as if the bank was simply shuffling its own funds.","Renaissance eventually pressed the British banking giant Barclays to begin offering basket option contracts too—and threatened to take its business elsewhere if the bank refused. According to the Senate investigation, Barclays agreed. (Barclays did not respond to requests for comment).","Then, in 2007, the first tremors of the financial crisis hit, and the quantitative hedge fund industry that Simons had helped pioneer suffered enormous losses, partly because the turmoil had short-circuited trading algorithms. Suddenly, these companies found themselves under federal scrutiny, and economists began pondering whether they posed a risk to the financial system.","Medallion weathered the turmoil better than most. The following year, when the financial meltdown struck, the fund still delivered 80 percent returns. Simons’ peers marveled at his savvy and resilience. “There are just a few individuals who have truly changed how we view the markets,” Theodore Aronson, a quantitative hedge fund manager from Philadelphia told Bloomberg. “John Maynard Keynes is one of the few…So is Jim Simons.”","Simons and George Soros, prior to testifying at a 2008 House hearing on “hedge funds and the financial market” Kevin Wolf/AP","But some of the Renaissance funds that were open to outside investors were floundering. The largest among them, Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund, fell by 16 percent in 2008 and lost another 6 percent in 2009. In May of that year, the Wall Street Journal reported that investors were upset about the gap between Medallion returns and those from other Renaissance funds and that, a month earlier, the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun inspecting the company’s books.","Simons resigned as CEO in November 2009 (though he remained chairman of the board) and handed the reins to Robert Mercer and Peter Brown. Meanwhile, the turmoil continued. The following spring, the Dow Jones Industrial plunged 1,000 points, only to rebound a few minutes later. It was the largest one-day swing in the Dow’s history. And, according to an SEC investigation, it was due largely to high-frequency trading, which now accounted for 60 percent of all market transactions.","After the “flash crash,” quantitative hedge funds found themselves under greater scrutiny. In November 2010, the Internal Revenue Service, which had been investigating Renaissance’s use of options to avoid taxes, issued a generic public memo. The memo found that hedge funds—not their partner banks—controlled the assets underlying basket options and should be paying taxes on their day-to-day trading. But Renaissance continued using options to avoid short-term capital gains taxes. (The company’s spokesman, Jonathan Gasthalter, told Mother Jones that Renaissance remains confident “the tax treatment for the option transactions are appropriate under current law.” Deutsche Bank eventually put a moratorium on new basket options but continued servicing existing ones, according to the Senate investigation.)","As federal agents pored over its books, Renaissance launched a political offensive. The company, which had been doing very little lobbying, spent $240,000 lobbying in 2010. The following year, it spent $740,000, almost all of it advocating on tax issues. Renaissance executives and directors were also pumping money into campaigns. In 2010, Mercer—a staunch conservative who helped finance the opposition to the Islamic center near Ground Zero—gave $200,000 to fund attack ads against Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), who had sponsored bills to tax derivatives and high-frequency trading. During the 2012 election cycle, Mercer gave $5.5 million to Republican candidates and outside groups, including Karl Rove’s American Crossroads ($2 million) and Restore Our Future ($1 million), a super-PAC that backed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. He also pumped nearly $1 million into a super-PAC that aimed to defeat Rep. Timothy Bishop (D-N.Y.), a former SEC prosecutor who had prosecuted white-collar fraud. (Renaissance is based in Bishop’s Long Island district.)","At the same time, Simons gave $9.6 million to Democratic candidates, campaign committees, and outside groups—more than any donor except former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and reclusive media mogul Fred Eychaner. Priorities Action USA, a super-PAC backing Barack Obama, was his largest beneficiary. Besides sinking $5 million of his own money into the group, the hedge fund billionaire hosted an event for prospective Priorities Action donors during the Democratic convention.","Viveca Novak of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks political giving, says it is not unusual for firms with business before Congress to give generously to both parties. “Often, the strategy is to make sure that you’ve got both sides covered,” she says. “It’s just smart politics.” But during the 2012 cycle, Renaissance was the only firm with super-PAC megadonors spreading huge sums to Democrats and Republicans.","According to documents released by the Senate subcommittee, in the spring of 2012, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York learned of Renaissance’s dealings with Deutsche Bank. As it turns out, two years earlier Deutsche Bank had admitted to participating in an unrelated tax shelter scheme involving billions of dollars in bogus write-offs for individuals. To avoid criminal prosecution, the bank had agreed to pay more than $550 million to the US government and to disclose any deals that might run afoul of US tax law.","After discovering the Renaissance arrangement, the Federal Reserve insisted that Deutsche Bank inform the Justice Department. Around this time, the bank began offering a new kind of basket options that no longer shielded clients from short-term capital gains tax, though hedge funds were still able to sidestep federal leverage limits. In 2013, Barclays followed suit.","By now, Renaissance had been under federal investigation for at least four years—though neither the SEC nor the IRS had cracked down on its activities—and the Senate subcommittee on investigations had begun probing the use of basket options by it and other hedge funds. With the 2014 midterm elections looming, Renaissance’s leadership began pouring more money into politics. Mercer gave to a variety of Republican candidates, right-leaning super-PACs, and anti-tax groups such as Club for Growth Action. Simons, on the other hand, donated $2 million to the Senate Majority PAC, which is fighting to retain Democratic control of the Senate, and $1 million to the Democratic House Majority PAC.","This July, as the subcommittee was preparing to unveil its findings at a hearing, the famously secretive Simons granted a wide-ranging interview to the New York Times. The paper ran a glowing profile, focusing on his philanthropy, his personal struggles, and his “ferocious curiosity.” It made no mention of his political giving. According to Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax policy expert who was called to testify, on the day of the hearing, Renaissance flooded the chambers with lawyers and lobbyists. “Their tentacles were everywhere,” he recalls.","The Senate investigation ultimately found that the hedge funds in question had been using “fictional” options to inflate profits and dodge taxes—Renaissance alone had earned more than $30 billion in profits and avoided an estimated $6 billion in taxes under this system. During the hearing, Levin, the subcommittee chairman, stressed these gains had come at the expense of ordinary Americans. “This structure…worked well for the hedge funds, which made billions of dollars in profits,” he said. “But it didn’t work for average taxpayers, who had to shoulder the tax burden these hedge funds shrugged off with the aid of the banks. And it didn’t work for the financial system, which is still recovering from a devastating crisis brought on by excess risk, and remains ill-equipped to withstand another shock from over-leveraged financial institutions.”","Levin has been pressing federal agencies—including the IRS, which is still investigating Renaissance’s business practices—to crack down on abusive tax shelters and collect additional taxes from hedge funds that used dubious options. But the six-term Michigan senator is retiring in January. The hedge fund lobbyists and megadonors aren’t going anywhere.","FACT:","Mother Jones was founded as a nonprofit in 1976 because we knew corporations and the wealthy wouldn’t fund the type of hard-hitting journalism we set out to do.","Today, reader support makes up about two-thirds of our budget, allows us to dig deep on stories that matter, and lets us keep our reporting free for everyone.

That means that around 300,000 people could sign up for a personality test quiz, and in the process hand over information of 150 times that number.","Now, however, Facebook apps are only allowed to gather information from users who have directly signed up for them, greatly limiting their reach. That change was made in 2014, and rolled out to every Facebook app over the course of 2015.","But it’s still the case that apps which you have directly enabled can harvest a significant amount of data from your account – often information which you might be surprised to know you’re handing over.","The app settings page on Facebook is the place to manage the apps you’ve given access to. Clicking on the link will bring up a list of apps under “logged in with Facebook”. Hopefully you’ll recognise most of them – if there’s any you don’t, consider clicking the “X”, deauthorising them from your account.","No one can pretend Facebook is just harmless fun any more | Ellie Mae O’Hagan","Read more","You might also want to click on the edit button under the “apps others use” heading lower down the page. This takes you to your privacy settings for the modern version of the same feature Cambridge Analytica profited from. The information others can hand over on your behalf is limited, but still includes data such as your date of birth, religious and political views, and activities, interests and things you like. Consider unchecking all the boxes. According to Facebook, leaving them all checked will make your friends’ “experience better and more social”, which doesn’t seem like a good trade-off for you.","If that’s not enough for you to feel safe, maybe now’s the time to delete your Facebook account altogether.","That’s somewhat harder to do. If you go through the account settings, Facebook will attempt to push you to “deactivate” your account, which “will disable your profile and remove your name and photo from most things that you’ve shared on Facebook”. Notably, it won’t remove any of your data from Facebook’s servers, and your account lies dormant hoping you will change your mind.","If you actually want to delete your information from Facebook, the real setting is hidden in a help document with the title “how do I permanently delete my account?” Clicking on “let us know” on that page will take users to the real account deletion screen. Clicking “delete my account” will take you to another screen. Filling in your password and proving you aren’t a robot on that screen will finally… deactivate your account. Wait two weeks after that, and then, at long last, Facebook will begin the 90 day process of deleting all your data from the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Facebook has been asked to respond to the questions by April 7.","The query comes against the backdrop of revelations by a whistleblower that CA had accessed data of millions of users.","This data was allegedly used to influence the outcomes of the Brexit poll and the US presidential election. The same whistleblower said that he “believes” CA was retained by the Indian National Congress, a charge the Congress has denied. Hindustan Times has previously reported, referencing the website of CA’s Indian partner that has since been taken down, that the company claims to have worked for both the Congress and the BJP in India. A parliamentary panel on IT has asked ministry officials to appear before it on April 6 and respond to queries on “citizens data security and privacy”, BJP lawmaker and chairman of the committee Anurag Thakur said.","On March 23, the government issued a notice to political marketing firm Cambridge Analytica seeking details of an alleged data breach and attempts to influence election outcomes.","FB said it is working hard to tackle past abuse and prevent it in the future. “We are strongly committed to protecting people’s information. As Mark Zuckerberg has said, we are working hard to tackle past abuse and prevent future abuse. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology has raised, as we continue our review of the situation,” a Facebook India spokesperson said in response to an email query.","Experts however said that the government’s questionnaire may not yield much except showing it is serious about data misuse and stressed on the need for a strong data protection and privacy law. Apar Gupta, a Delhi-based lawyer and cyber media law expert, said the government’s communiqué to the social media company is not a legal request and does not originate from any clear basis in law. “Hence, FB may not only choose to ignore it but also will not have any objective legal standard from which to make their response. This entire exercise on part of the government may assuage public concern but will not solve the underlying problem of the absence of a legal protection for data protection,” he added. A 10-member committee headed by retired Supreme Court judge BN Srikrishna is in the process of examining privacy and data protection issues and coming up with a draft legislation.","Sunil Abraham, founder of the think tank Centre for Internet and Society, said Wednesday’s letter sends out the message that Indian policy makers are serious about holding Internet giants accountable for their actions and the eyes of these decision-makers will be on FB in the run up to the next election. India is a key market for Facebook with 217 million people using the platform every month.

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Today, Facebook’s founder is fighting to show that he is capable of leading the world’s eighth-biggest listed company or that any of its 2.1bn users should trust it.","News that Cambridge Analytica (CA), a firm linked to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, got data on 50m Facebook users in dubious, possibly illegal, ways has lit a firestorm (see article). Mr Zuckerberg took five days to reply and, when he did, he conceded that Facebook had let its users down in the past but seemed not to have grasped that its business faces a wider crisis of confidence. After months of talk about propaganda and fake news, politicians in Europe and, increasingly, America see Facebook as out of control and in denial. Congress wants him to testify. Expect a roasting.","Since the news, spooked investors have wiped 9% off Facebook’s shares. Consumers are belatedly waking up to the dangers of handing over data to tech giants that are run like black boxes. Already, according to the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank, a majority of Americans say they distrust social-media firms. Mr Zuckerberg and his industry need to change, fast.","The addiction game","Facebook’s business relies on three elements: keeping users glued to their screens, collecting data about their behaviour and convincing advertisers to pay billions of dollars to reach them with targeted ads. The firm has an incentive to promote material that grabs attention and to sell ads to anyone. Its culture melds a ruthless pursuit of profit with a Panglossian and narcissistic belief in its own virtue. Mr Zuckerberg controls the firm’s voting rights. Clearly, he gets too little criticism.","In the latest fiasco, it emerged that in 2013 an academic in Britain built a questionnaire app for Facebook users, which 270,000 people answered. They in turn had 50m Facebook friends. Data on all these people then ended up with CA. (Full disclosure: The Economist once used CA for a market-research project.) Facebook says that it could not happen again and that the academic and CA broke its rules; both deny doing anything wrong. Regulators in Europe and America are investigating. Facebook knew of the problem in 2015, but it did not alert individual users. Although nobody knows how much CA benefited Mr Trump’s campaign, the fuss has been amplified by the left’s disbelief that he could have won the election fairly.","But that does not give Facebook a defence. The episode fits an established pattern of sloppiness towards privacy, tolerance of inaccuracy and reluctance to admit mistakes. In early 2017 Mr Zuckerberg dismissed the idea that fake news had influenced the election as “pretty crazy”. In September Facebook said Kremlin-linked firms had spent a mere $100,000 to buy 3,000 adverts on its platform, failing at first to mention that 150m users had seen free posts by Russian operatives. It has also repeatedly misled advertisers about its user statistics.","Facebook is not about to be banned or put out of business, but the chances of a regulatory backlash are growing. Europe is inflicting punishment by a thousand cuts, from digital taxes to antitrust cases. And distrustful users are switching off. The American customer base of Facebook’s core social network has stagnated since June 2017. Its share of America’s digital advertising market is forecast to dip this year for the first time. The network effect that made Facebook ever more attractive to new members as it grew could work in reverse if it starts to shrink. Facebook is worth $493bn, but only has $14bn of physical assets. Its value is intangible—and, potentially, ephemeral.","If Mr Zuckerberg wants to do right by the public and his firm, he must rebuild trust. So far he has promised to audit some apps, restrict developers’ access to data still further, and help people control which apps have access to their data.","That doesn’t go nearly far enough. Facebook needs a full, independent examination of its approach to content, privacy and data, including its role in the 2016 election and the Brexit referendum. This should be made public. Each year Facebook should publish a report on its conduct that sets out everything from the prevalence of fake news to privacy breaches.","Next, Facebook and other tech firms need to open up to outsiders, safely and methodically. They should create an industry ombudsman—call it the Data Rights Board. Part of its job would be to set and enforce the rules by which accredited independent researchers look inside platforms without threatening users’ privacy. Software is being developed with this in mind (see article). The likes of Facebook raise big questions. How does micro-targeting skew political campaigns? What biases infect facial-recognition algorithms? Better they be answered with evidence instead of outrage.","The board or something like it could also act as a referee for complaints, and police voluntary data-protection protocols. Facebook, for example, is planning to comply worldwide with some of the measures contained in a new European law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. Among other things, this will give users more power to opt out of being tracked online and to stop their information being shared with third parties. Adherence to such rules needs to be closely monitored.","Thumbs down","Tech has experience of acting collectively to solve problems. Standards on hardware and software, and the naming of internet domains, are agreed on jointly. Facebook’s rivals may be wary but, if the industry does not come up with a joint solution, a government clampdown will become inevitable.","Facebook seems to think it only needs to tweak its approach. In fact it, and other firms that hoover up consumer data, should assume that their entire business model is at risk. As users become better informed, the alchemy of taking their data without paying and manipulating them for profit may die. Firms may need to compensate people for their data or let them pay to use platforms ad-free. Profits won’t come as easily, but the alternative is stark. If Facebook ends up as a regulated utility with its returns on capital capped, its earnings may drop by 80%. How would you like that, Mr Zuckerberg?","This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \"Epic fail\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

While deposing in front of UK lawmakers, Wylie said that CA equated to a group of modern colonisers that don't care what is legal or what is not unless it gets the job done.","Update: Around an hour after his initial statement, Wylie has offered more details, including naming Congress as one of the parties that possibly worked with CA. \"I believe their client was Congress but I know that they have done all kinds of project. I don't remember a national project but I know regionally. India's so big that one state can be as big as Britain. But they do have offices there, they do have staff,\" he reportedly said. He added that he might have documentary proof of CA's activities in India.","Wylie made the confirmation before the digital, culture, media and sport committee in the House of Commons while testifying against Cambridge Analytica and its alleged role in propagating a culture of fake news and disinformation. Cambridge Analytica is accused of harvesting more than 50 million user profiles on Facebook with the help of academic researcher Aleksandr Kogan, without any consent from users, allegedly playing a role in the 2016 US presidential election, seeing Donald Trump through victory.","When a lawmaker brought up India, which according to the lawmaker, is Facebook's biggest market, Wylie nodded and said that CA worked in India. \"India is Facebook's biggest market, it is a country that is rife with political discord and opportunities to destabilise,\" said the UK lawmaker, prompting a reply from Wylie.","\"They (CA) worked extensively in India, they have an office (there),\" said Wylie. The deposition is still going on and more details related to the alleged CA operations in India may come up.","Although so far no concrete evidence has come up that CA, a firm that allegedly influenced and \"hacked\" elections across the world, worked in India, both Congress and BJP have levied allegations against each other. Both have claimed that the other party worked with CA, or with of its partner companies in India.","In his deposition, Wylie liked CA to a coloniser. \"They are examples of what the modern day colonialism looks like, you have a wealthy company from developed nation going into an economy or democracy that is struggling and takes advantage of that and profits from that,\" he said. \"They don't care whether what they do is legal or not as long as they get the job done...This (CA) is a company that goes around the world undermining the institutions in countries that are struggling to develop those institutions.","As an upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica apparently specialises in psychographic profile building techniques that can apparently identify the personalities of voters, the information that can then be used for micro-targeting of voters to influence their behaviour. The upstart allegedly had a role to play in the 2016 US presidential election, seeing Donald Trump through victory. The upstart allegedly also had a role to play in Brexit or Britain's infamous Exit from the European Union. Wylie's confirmation suggests the company may have had a role to play influencing the electoral process in other parts of the world as well, including in India.","Cambridge Analytica served as Donald Trump's data operations team during the 2016 election. The upstart has been accused of harvesting more than 50 million user profiles on Facebook with the help of academic researcher Aleksandr Kogan. Without any consent from users. It was a data breach like no other.","Facebook feels differently though. \"The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said.","He said “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","FILE PHOTO - A Facebook logo is pictured at the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt, Germany September 16, 2017. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski","$6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica.","“Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign.","He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information “in a legitimate way” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie.","Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan’s app when it learned of the violation, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.","Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that “not all data was deleted.”","FILE PHOTO: A Facebook sign is displayed at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, U.S., February 23, 2018.

The company had grown from a single refinery in Cleveland in 1863 to produce 87% of all US refined oil output. In 1911, the supreme court decided that Standard Oil was in breach of anti-trust legislation passed by Congress and ordered that the company be broken up.","Even before the data mining revelations that have engulfed Facebook, there was pressure in the US for similar action to be taken against the social media networking site and two other globally dominant companies – Google and Amazon – that have come from nowhere in the past two decades.","Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk","The argument goes like this. Data is as vital to the modern digital economy as oil was a century ago. The tech giants have the same sort of monopoly power that Standard Oil once had (Google and Facebook accounted for two-thirds of online advertising spending in the US last year and Amazon was responsible for 75% of online book sales). Mark Zuckerberg might wear chinos rather than the top hat sported by Rockefeller but a robber baron is a robber baron. It is time for anti-trust legislation to be used to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon.","The charge sheet is a long one: the tech giants are exploiting their monopoly power to stifle competition; they are spreading fake news; their fantastically rich owners portray themselves as right-on yet go to a great deal of trouble to minimise their corporate tax bills; they are ripping the heart out of communities through the closure of bricks-and-mortar retailers. To the list can now be added (in Facebook’s case) the harvesting of the personal data of 50 million Americans and its use for political purposes.","No question, Big Tech is more vulnerable to a backlash from Washington than it has ever been. Companies have outgrown management systems that were not designed for systemically important businesses and have used their market power to gobble up rivals. It is this charge – that the disruptive startup companies of yesteryear are today’s anti-capitalists – that creates the biggest risk of anti-trust action.","Timeline","Big oil and the US government","1911","Standard Oil broken up","Standard Oil’s monopoly is broken up by the US supreme court. The trust which had been set up by John D Rockefeller in 1882, had gained control of nearly 90% of US oil production.","1917","Oil industry gets close to government during war","The US joins the first world war and supplies allied forces with oil. President Woodrow Wilson appoints multiple oil executives to war-effort committees and nationalises the railways.","1919","API created","Brought together by the war, oil executives form a trade body, the American Petroleum Institute (API) in 1919. Ten years later, another trade association, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) is formed to represent smaller companies.","1939","Second world war starts","During the second world war, the US government worked closely with the oil industry, putting a federal investigation into its monopolistic practices on hold. A peacetime version of a wartime committee becomes the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee that exists today.","1959","Global warming warning","API hosts renowned nuclear physicist Edward Teller at a conference at Columbia University, where he warns of impending global warming.","1965","President Johnson warns of global warning","Lyndon B Johnson is the first US president to publicly acknowledge climate change, calling it a serious global threat during a speech.","1968","CO2 warning","Scientists at the Stanford Research Institute deliver reports to API, warning of global warming induced by CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.","1970","EPA created","President Nixon signs an executive order creating the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).","1978","CO2 research by Exxon starts","Exxon starts an internal climate research programme on carbon dioxide.","1979","Ozone standards weakened","The EPA relaxes the standard for ozone, which contributes to smog. The move angers environmentalists and industry alike. API sues the agency.","1988","Nasa scientist gives evidence","Nasa scientist James E Hansen testifies before Congress that the planet is warming because of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuels.","1997","Kyoto Protocol signed","The Kyoto protocol treaty is signed. Countries pledge to reduce greenhouse gases and recognise the scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and is likely caused by fossil fuel emissions.","President Trump announces the US exit from the Paris climate agreement, citing industry-hired economists that call the accord a bad deal for US businesses. Supporting the move is Scott Pruitt, a climate-change sceptic, who Trump appointed to head the EPA.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","Those who have Facebook, Google and Amazon in their sights can draw on Adam Smith for support. In the bible of modern capitalism, the Wealth of Nations, Smith said: “To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it.” Excessive market power, in other words, is bad because it thwarts progress. Old established businesses can see off potential rivals even though the new entrants might have new and better ways of doing things.","This concept, that Facebook et al are anti-capitalist, explains why the pressure for anti-trust action against them is coming from both right and left – from Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, as well as from the leading Democrat Elizabeth Warren.","After all, it’s said, much of the innovation that blossomed in Silicon Valley was the result of the breakup of the telephone company AT&T in 1982. AT&T saw off challengers by deciding what equipment could be used on its national network: Google does the same by using algorithms to decide what comes up on an internet search. Without government action, there was no real prospect of AT&T’s stranglehold being broken and the same applies today given the market dominance of the big tech giants.","The reality is that breaking up Facebook, Google and Amazon would not be as simple as their critics think. America’s anti-trust legislation is tightly defined and there is no provision for action simply because a company is deemed to be too big. What counts is whether size is being exploited to damage consumer interests.","That’s going to be tricky to prove. Consumers get Google and Facebook for free, while Amazon offers books – and an array of other goods – at a discount. Nor can it be said the companies are failing to invest in new products: all three companies devote an impressive share of their turnover to R&D.","Actually, of course, consumers are not getting Google and Facebook for free. They don’t have to part with hard cash but they have to accept that their online activities will be constantly monitored so that advertisers – commercial or political – can tailor ads personally for them. People are now waking up to the terms of this Faustian bargain, which is why there will be calls for a change in US competition policy to make anti-trust action easier to prosecute.","This would require an ideological shift. Americans think the reason they have a Facebook, a Google and an Amazon and the Europeans don’t is that they have a more relaxed attitude towards companies growing big and powerful. The US sees winner-takes-all markets as the law of the capitalist jungle; the EU sees them as an intrinsic threat to consumers.","A twin-track approach – tougher regulation of Big Tech with the threat of anti-trust action if it doesn’t comply – looks likelier than an immediate recourse to breakup. There are echoes here of the financial crash of a decade ago. Back then, there were calls for a new Glass Steagall act to break up the banks into retail and investment arms, as was the case from the 1930s to the 1990s. It didn’t happen. The banks expressed regret and then used their considerable lobbying power to head off or water down the threat of radical reform. Politicians talked a lot tougher than they eventually acted. They should be careful not to make the same mistake again."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

The accusation leveled against the voter-profiling research firm Cambridge Analytica involves the exploitation of Facebook users’ personal choices and “likes” — expressed online voluntarily for their friends to see — that let researchers and analysts make educated guesses about a person’s political leanings and susceptibility to advertising.","“This sounds scary to a lot of people because the name ‘Trump‘ is attached to it,” Republican digital strategist Patrick Ruffini said. “In reality, this was being done first by the Obama campaign in 2012 and subsequently by other Republican campaigns. This is no different than what Obama did, and no different than what other campaigns and companies have done.”","He said the data collection “was the equivalent of downloading someone’s Twitter follower list.”","Facebook said Monday that it had hired a firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by the Trump campaign, and the whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who accused Cambridge of misusing the data.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” Facebook said in a statement. “We remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Mr. Wylie said the data were first collected by Russian-American academic researcher Aleksandr Kogan through an app called This Is Your Digital Life,” which asked users to answer questions voluntarily for a psychological profile. By default, the app’s privacy settings allowed its developers to access users’ Facebook information, such as their hometowns and whether they “like” the game “Angry Birds” or the movie “The Shawshank Redemption.”","Cambridge is accused of gathering users’ data without their explicit consent in 2014 and 2015 from Mr. Kogan, in violation of Facebook policies.","“Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford the firm complete access to their servers and systems,” Facebook said. “We have approached the other parties involved — Christopher Wylie and Aleksandr Kogan — and asked them to submit to an audit as well. Mr. Kogan has given his verbal agreement to do so. Mr. Wylie thus far has declined.”","Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica last week for what it says is a violation of its policies.","The personal choices expressed on social media, along with a list of the users’ online “friends,” can be used by analysts to develop a personality profile of someone with a Facebook account. From there, users’ names can be matched against voter rolls to create a list of likely voters to reach through advertising in a presidential election.","Cambridge Analytica, formerly led by ex-White House strategist Steve Bannon, denies that it used any Facebook data for the Trump campaign in 2016. The firm says it deleted all the information when it learned that the academic researcher shouldn’t have sold the data to the company.","“This isn’t a spy movie,” the company said on Twitter. “We’re a data analytics company doing research & analysis on commercial, public and data sets for clients.”","Lawmakers are calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to explain what happened.","Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat, and John Kennedy, Louisiana Republican, called on the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday to hold a hearing with tech company CEOs to examine what they are doing to protect online data.","“The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights,” the senators wrote.","Consumer advocates are noting that Facebook didn’t notify the affected users for two years. Others are questioning whether Facebook users have had their privacy invaded.","“I think Facebook users should be deeply concerned,” said Patrick Hynes, president of the online communications firm Hynes Communications in Washington. “They have been given all kinds of public assurances that this wasn’t going to happen to their data. And they accepted a social media environment that said they’re going to be served ads based on their preferences, but that their personal information was never going to be given to any outside entity that would then use that information for ad sales or psychological profiling or any other kind of third-party activity. This violates the ‘contract’ that we have with Facebook.”","Mr. Ruffini, a former Republican National Committee strategist who runs the digital analytics firm Echelon Insights, said companies conduct similar kinds of online market research constantly.","“It’s no different than what companies every day are doing to figure out, based on available data points about you, to model out whether you’re going to buy a car,” Mr. Ruffini said. “Those things happen on the internet every day. Hundreds of people are doing this to you right now.”","Democrats, overlooking the fact that President Obama’s re-election campaign pioneered data mining of social media to reach voters younger than 30, see a sinister development in the Trump campaign’s reported use of the information.","Rep. James A. Hines, Connecticut Democrat and a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which has interviewed Mr. Bannon, said he cannot believe that a company formerly run by Mr. Bannon and owned by wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer would not have exploited the Facebook data to Mr. Trump’s advantage.","“That work was used,” Mr. Himes said Monday on CNN. “By whom, and exactly when, I’m not sure. [But] that work was used.”","Cambridge Analytica said Mr. Obama’s 2008 campaign “was famously data-driven, pioneered microtargeting in 2012, talking to people specifically based on the issues they care about.”","That statement prompted a former Obama campaign official, Jeremy Bird, to fire back on Twitter that Cambridge is accused of stealing data on 50 million Facebook users.","“That’s not ‘data-driven,’” Mr. Bird tweeted. “That’s theft.

Given the power they had on influencing the electorate, imagine what they could do with 12 years of public school data collected on your child.","What data? And how was it used?","A psychologist named Michael Kosinski (see full report) from Cambridge developed a method to analyze Facebook members, using the cute little personality quizzes or games. What started as a fun experiment resulted with the largest data set combining psychometric scores with Facebook profiles ever to be collected. Dr. Kosinski is a leading expert in psychometrics, a data-driven sub-branch of psychology. His work is grounded on the Five Factors of Personality theory which include something called OCEAN: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.","So many people volunteered their personal information to play these games and take these quizzes that before long Kosinski had volumes of data from which he could now predict all sorts of things about the attitudes and behaviors of these individuals. He applied the Five Factors (Big Five Theory) model (well-known in psychometric circles) and developed a system by which he could predict very personal and detailed behaviors of individuals on a level deeper than had been accessed by prior models or systems.","Enter Cambridge Analytica (CA), a company connected to a British firm called SCL Group, which provides governments, political groups and companies around the world with services ranging from military disinformation campaigns to social media branding and voter targeting. CA indirectly acquired Kosinksi’s model and method for his MyPersonality database without his consent.","Then, CA was hired by the Trump team to provide “dark advertising” that would sway undecided people toward a Trump vote. CA was able to access this data to search for specific profiles: “all anxious fathers, all angry introverts, for example—or maybe even all undecided Democrats.” See motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/big-data-cambridge-analytica-brexit-trump","Steve Bannon sits on the board for Cambridge Analytica.","“We are thrilled that our revolutionary approach to data-driven communication has played such an integral part in President-elect Trump’s extraordinary win,” Alexander James Ashburner Nix was quoted as saying. According to Motherboard, “His company wasn’t just integral to Trump’s online campaign, but to the UK’s Brexit campaign as well.” In Nix’s own words, it worked like this: “At Cambridge,” he said, “we were able to form a model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.”","The report continues, “according to Nix, the success of Cambridge Analytica’s marketing is based on a combination of three elements: behavioral science using the OCEAN Model, Big Data analysis, and ad targeting. Ad targeting is personalized advertising, aligned as accurately as possible to the personality of an individual consumer.” Then these same consumers receive “dark posts”-or, advertisements specifically devised for them, and that cannot be viewed by anyone else other than that person.","Where did the Big Five Theory come from?","Dr. Raymond Cattell is regaled in Western culture for his so called notable contributions to the field of intelligence assessment (IQ and personality work). Despite his direct and profound relationship to the eugenics movement and his recognition by the Nazi Party for the birth of The Beyondists, his work is benignly promoted in scholarly circles. But the fact that he is professionally legitimized does not make him any less the racist he was. And his contributions toward racist practices live on. He has two notable theories of personality development and measurement entitled The Big Five Theory and the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF).","The way that OCEANS Five Factors personality data from our students can be used:","The recent trend toward a “grit narrative,” hailed by Angela Duckworth and others, has been gobbled up by school districts around the country. The OCEANS model is used widely by schools and other institutions internationally.","There is a growing emphasis on the “affective” learning of students. Some examples include: “ETS’ SuccessNavigator assessment and ACT’s Engage College Domains and Scales Overview … the broader domains in these models are tied to those areas of the big five personality theory.”","While “grit” has been exposed for the racist narrative it is, it’s also a direct by-product of the same OCEANS framework used to control, predict and manipulate voters. If this data can sway major national elections and change the global trajectory of history, imagine what such data, gathered on children, day after day, year after year, could yield for corporations and government interests.","Watch the video from Jesse Schell, gaming CEO, to see exactly where this can go. As Schell says “your shopping data is a goldmine” and it’s only a matter of time before gaming companies and gaming behavior interface with our daily consumer and behavioral choices. You can get points for simply brushing your teeth long enough when product brands partner with gaming systems.”","We now have, thanks to perpetual assessments of children’s knowledge affective “grit” or personality, “the concept of the ‘preemptive personality,” the endlessly profiled and guided subject who is shunted into recalculated futures in a system that could be characterized as digital predestination.”","The role of education technology (aka “personalized learning”):","According to a report entitled Networks of Control: “Jennifer Whitson (2013) argues that today’s technology-based practices of gamification are ‘rooted in surveillance’ because they provide ‘real-time feedback about users’ actions by amassing large quantities of data’. According to her, gamification is ‘reliant on quantification’, on ‘monitoring users’ everyday lives to measure and quantify their activities’. Gamification practices based on data collection and quantification are ‘leveraging surveillance to evoke behavior change’ … While self-quantification promises to “make daily practices more fulfilling and fun” by adopting ‘incentivization and pleasure rather than risk and fear to shape desired behaviours’, it also became ‘a new driving logic in the technological expansion and public acceptance of surveillance’."],"isopubdate":"2018-04-01"}

That’s how dedicated we are to factual accuracy at Facebook.”","“In fact, we recently stopped a major fake story when we forced thousands of Muslim families to establish sharia law in Dallas and then blackmailed the entire police department until they agreed to treat a local neighborhood as a no-go zone,” Zuckerberg added.","In addition to employing a new, state-of-the-art algorithm to help sort out stories that are currently true from those that need to become true, officials said the company would introduce a new feature that allows users to flag articles that are not yet real. According to sources, stories would then be sent to Facebook’s fact-checking partners, including InfoWars, YourNewsWire.com, and the Daily Stormer, for further review.","Advertisement","The social media company has also completed construction on a 3-million-square-foot command center in Silicon Valley, from which it will deploy tens of thousands of employees to points across the globe in order to carry out in real life the events depicted in fake stories, whether that means setting up Obamacare death panels, hiring immigrants to go out and commit crimes in disproportionately high numbers, convincing Melania Trump to employ a body double, or working around the clock to develop a vaccine that will finally cause autism in children.","“If an article on Facebook states that President Trump’s agenda is being undermined due to a deep-state conspiracy headed by Ellen DeGeneres, it is our public responsibility to infiltrate the federal government with thousands of highly trained agents, recruit Ms. DeGeneres as an asset, and make that a reality,” said Zuckerberg, who also outlined a plan to purchase a massive fleet of jets that will spray trails of chemicals across the sky in order to psychologically manipulate the world’s populace. “As a precautionary measure, we’ve already begun sending paychecks to anyone who protests at an event where Trump is speaking, just in case another story on Facebook accuses them of having been paid for their efforts.”","“Similarly, in response to fabricated accounts on Facebook of how the government is attempting to destroy Second Amendment rights, we staged a ‘school shooting’ in which no one actually died and child actors were used to portray the supposedly dead victims,” Zuckerberg continued.","Advertisement","Executives at Facebook confirmed their efforts go beyond fighting politically motivated stories, saying that after an article about a sleeping morgue employee being mistaken for a dead body and cremated was flagged as false, they saw to it the individual in question was burned alive. In response to a story spread on the site about a banana in an Oklahoma Walmart testing positive for HIV, Facebook hired a team of scientists to genetically engineer fruit capable of contracting the disease and had it placed in the store’s produce department.","Because fake celebrity death stories are among the most widespread of hoaxes perpetuated on Facebook, the company has reportedly corrected those mistakes by ordering its in-house team of assassins to kill Kirk Douglas, Bob Barker, Robert Redford, Carlos Santana, Paul McCartney, Jackie Chan, Mark McGrath, and others.","Early feedback from Facebook users on the plan to make fake news real has been largely positive.","Advertisement","“It’s great to know that when I see a story about Malia Obama getting arrested for drug possession, Facebook will, one way or another, make sure that is indeed what happens,” said 33-year-old Greenville, NC resident Keith Wade. “I hate it when I get told things like, ‘Delta Airlines is offering free tickets if you take a short survey,’ and then find out later it’s not true.

The number of users’ data the firm reportedly gained access to (50 million) is much higher because it includes the users’ friends. The number of user data, it follows, was much higher for the Obama campaign, too.","How it was accessed","The real divergence is in the way each campaign accessed the data.","The Obama campaign created a Facebook app for supporters to donate, learn of voting requirements, and find nearby houses to canvass. The app asked users’ permission to scan their photos, friends lists, and news feeds. Most users complied.","The people signing up knew the data they were handing over would be used to support a political campaign. Their friends, however, did not.","The people who downloaded the app used by Cambridge Analytica did not know their data would be used to aid any political campaigns. The app was billed as a personality quiz that would be used by Cambridge University researchers.","Aleksandr Kogan, one of the Cambridge researchers involved in the project, sold the data to the upstart political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The company then sold its services not only to the Trump campaign, but to the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz and the senatorial campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., among others.","When Facebook discovered a developer had shared users’ data without their consent in 2015, it asked both the original app and the consultancy to delete the data. That didn’t happen.","\"The thing that is true is that every Facebook app you downloaded back then was getting access to your entire friends list,\" said David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. \"When tech people were trying to raise outrage about it they were being ignored. Now, everyone is outraged. But what (McCain) is wrong about this is that Kogan then sold it, and for a much creepier purpose.\"","How it was used","Obama operatives used Facebook data to get users to send their messaging for them, according to Eitan Hersh, a Tufts professor who wrote Hacking the Electorate, a book on Obama’s microtargeting strategies.","Facebook friends lists, tags and photos allowed Obama operatives to identify a person’s close friends, which they then matched with offline public records. (Was this person likely to vote for Obama, but unlikely to get out to vote?) They then told the app users which of their friends they should send campaign messages to.","Cambridge Analytica dialed up what Karpf called the creepiness factor. They combined the survey results with the Facebook data to create psychological profiles they then sold to campaigns. The idea was, if the firm could discover how these people thought, they could target ads toward them.","Cambridge Analytica then sent targeted ads to the users on their database as well as users with similar profiles, identified by Facebook’s Lookalike tool. The friends of the app users weren’t being targeted by their friends, but by the campaign itself. In other words, the consenting middle man was gone.","In his research, Hersh found that neither tactic was greatly effective at persuading people to vote.","Our ruling","McCain said that there was a strong equivalence between how the Obama and Trump campaigns accessed user data on Facebook.","The Obama campaign and Cambridge Analytica both gained access to huge amounts of information about Facebook users and their friends, and in neither case did the friends of app users consent.","But in Obama’s case, direct users knew they were handing over their data to a political campaign. In the Cambridge Analytica case, users only knew were taking a personality quiz for academic purposes.","The Obama campaign used the data to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends. Cambridge Analytica targeted users, friends and lookalikes directly with digital ads.","Whereas the data gathering and the uses were very different, the data each campaign gained access to was similar. We rate this statement Half True.","Update, April 11, 2018: This story has been updated to include additional information about Facebook’s audience tool.","How to contact us","Email comments and suggestions for fact-checks to [email protected] or find us on Facebook,and Twitter.

Additionally, most did not feel that SLP helps students be creative, prepares them for future education or future careers, helps them think critically or problem solve, helps them socialize or prepare them for future social situations, or strengthens the school community.” More than 72% of parents do not want the Summit platform used at all at their schools next year or that it should be made fully optional. Also, Indiana PA parents have posted a new website about their concerns.","Mark Zuckerberg recently posted a letter called Lessons in Philanthropy 2017 in which he recounted what he had learned over the last few years, and explained which education initiatives his LLC, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) would focus upon in the future.","The letter evinced no awareness of how his reputation and that of Facebook have been seriously tarnished in recent months, involving ongoing violations of privacy, the practice of hosting racially discriminatory ads as well as political ads bought by Russians in an apparent effort to undermine our elections. Increasingly, commentators have recognized how despite its name, Facebook is a faceless corporation, which operates through profit-making motivations and unaccountable algorithms, without the empathy or wisdom that only human agency can provide.","Nor did Zuckerberg’s words show any trace of humility, given how a large share of his earlier $100 million “investment’ in the Newark school system was diverted to politically-connected consultants and appears to have had few positive results for students. Instead, he focused on how his LLC will transform education through the “magic of technology.” Speaking of himself in the third person, he wrote:","The magic of technology is that it can help social change scale faster. And because of Mark’s experience building a world-class engineering organization at Facebook, we are in a unique position to build a philanthropy with a great engineering team to help our partners scale their social change faster as well.","One challenge we’ve seen in education is that there are many brilliant teachers and school leaders who create new kinds of schools based on new models of learning — but those schools usually only serve hundreds of students, while most children still do not have access to them. There are very few examples of new school models that expand to thousands of schools today.","Our hope is that technology can help with this scaling challenge. We’re seeing promising signs of early success, where our partnership with Summit Public Schools has helped encode their teaching philosophy in tools that will be used in more than 300 district, charter, and private schools this fall.","Zuckerberg went on to discuss the research of Benjamin Bloom – which “suggests we need an education system where all students receive the equivalent of an expert one-on-one tutor” but then assumed that online platforms can substitute for the close feedback of human tutors.","According to a CREDO 2017 analysis , Summit charter students showed no significant gain in reading compared to similar students at public schools, and exhibited a small but significantly negative effect in math. The most recent Gates-funded RAND analysis of Next Generation Learning schools, of which Summit is a prime example, concluded there were small and mostly insignificant gains in achievement at these schools, and students were more likely to feel alienated and unsafe compared to matched students at public schools. The overall results caused John Pane, the lead RAND researcher, to say to Ed Week that “the evidence base [for these schools] is very weak at this point. ”","Yet Summit’s mediocre academic and survey responses have not dampened the enthusiasm of its promoters, including Zuckerberg or Bill Gates. Gates continues to express support for Summit’s online platform, and in June, his foundation granted $10 million to Summit to “support implementation of the Summit Learning program in targeted geographies.” Lauren Powell-Jobs awarded Summit another $10 million to create a new Oakland high school. Finally, Betsy DeVos, the fourth member of this exclusive club, provided Diane Taverner, the founder of Summit, a prime speaking slot at her recent forum on “Rethinking schools.”","CZI’s education program is now headed by James Shelton, following stints at Exxon, McKinsey, various technology companies, the New Schools Venture Fund, the Gates Foundation, the US Department of Education, and most recently, a company called U2, for which he portrayed as “helping universities become better digital versions of themselves.” (In LinkedIn, he describes himself as a “Tri-sector Operator, Investor & Entrepreneur.”)","Last month in a blog post, Shelton wrote that his goal at CZI would be to provide disadvantaged children with the sort of personalized education that privileged children receive – the “kind of focus on individual needs and support that define privilege and make it available to all.” Yet in a sort of shell game, CZI seems intent on promoting a mere simulacrum of individual attention for underserved children, rather than the sustained and concentrated human support afforded students in small classes at private or wealthy suburban schools.","Meanwhile, parents whose children have been subjected to the Summit platform are pushing back in at least seven states and have seen some success. Parents in Cheshire, Connecticut posted a petition protesting the use of the program, criticized its low-quality at school board meetings, and finally persuaded the Superintendent last month to suspend the program midyear. They cited the platform’s demoralizing effect on their children, the lack of teacher feedback, the risks to their privacy, and the haphazard quality of the online curriculum, including a reference to bestiality in one of the modules.","Just days later, it was reported that the Indiana Area school board in Pennsylvania ordered “a rollback” of the Summit program mid-year because of similar complaints from parents about its negative impact on their kids. The district announced it will immediately drop the platform in two core subjects, and next year will allow parents to opt their children out of it entirely.","A subsequent survey of middle school students in the Indiana Area district using the online platform found that 39 percent said the Summit learning platform (SLP) should not be used at all, and another 31 percent said that it should be made fully optional. The largest percentages of students found the platform annoying, frustrating, stressful and boring.","As the researchers summarized the results, “most did not feel that SLP helps students be creative, prepares them for future education or future careers, helps them think critically or problem solve, helps them socialize or prepare them for future social situations, or strengthens the school community.” They also found that students “expressed a desire to spend less time on screens, and critiques of screen time often overlapped with critiques of SLP as a platform and teacher.”","As others have noted, this pattern of events seems similar to what occurred on a larger scale in the inception and ultimate collapse of inBloom, the Gates-funded $100 million online data-collection corporation that closed its doors nearly four years ago, because of parent anger at the risk it posed to their children’s privacy and its lack of proven benefits.","Just as the Gates Foundation used its vast resources to pay for the travel of state and district administrators for briefings and promised financial incentives of various kinds, so has the Zuckerberg millions enabled Summit to fly “the Cheshire administrative team to Oakland, California, for training and provided the district with 130 Chromebook computers,” according to the Associated Press. (See Natasha Singer’s series called “Education Disrupted” in the New York Times, about how Silicon Valley corporations have successfully infiltrated the classroom using similar strategies.)","Like Cheshire’s sudden suspension of Summit, Louisiana State Superintendent John White pulled student data out of inBloom’s cloud in mid-year, after parent protests broke out and the opposition of state school board members emerged, who had not been told in advance of its implementation. A few months later, Jefferson County Superintendent Cyndy Stevenson in Colorado announced that inBloom’s data collection would be made optional for students, and that she would leave this decision in their parents’ hands, just as has now occurred in Indiana, PA.","Yet this concession didn’t work to quiet the storm. As Rachael Stickland, a leader of the inBloom opposition in JeffCo recounts, “The board had hoped the promise of ‘opting out’ would calm down parents and relieve the pressure. It didn’t. We kept pushing. Ultimately, it became a political hot potato and they had to vote it out.”","But the greatest similarity to the inBloom controversy is how Summit has led to its supporters to express the same sort of condescension towards parents, claiming that their opposition is based on unwarranted fear and confusion. The Cheshire Superintendent blamed disaffection with Summit on “a substantial degree of misunderstanding and misinformation within the community.” Monica Bulger, a researcher at the Microsoft-backed Data and Society Institute, explained the parent pushback this way: “”There’s a powerful fear narrative happening” and that “We don’t necessarily want school content by popular vote.”","Bulger was one of the co-authors of a report released last year on the failure of inBloom, in which the vast majority of those interviewed and quoted supported and/or worked for this massive data-mining project. Several reviewers of the report, including Audrey Watters and Peter Greene, noted its evident bias and the way in which the authors assumed the unproven value of inBloom’s data-collection while dismissing legitimate parental concerns.","Bulger and her co-authors repeatedly suggested that parents’ rejection of inBloom was “irrational,” even as the project’s explicit purpose was to accelerate the collection and dispersal of their children’s personal information to a wide number of for-profit ed tech companies, and to encourage them to build their products around the data. As Watters wrote,","This juxtaposition of parents as “emotional” and inBloom and the project’s supporters as “scientific” and “technical” runs throughout the report, which really serves to undermine and belittle the fears of inBloom opponents. (This was also evident in many media reports at the time of inBloom’s demise that tended to describe parents as “hysterical” or that patronized them by contending the issues were “understandably obscure to the average PTA mom.”) The opposition to inBloom is described in the Data & Society report as a “visceral, fervently negative response to student data collection,” for example, while the data collection itself is repeatedly framed in terms of its “great promise.”","We see this strategy repeated once again among Summit’s defenders, who portray parental apprehensions as uninformed, even as they provide no independent evidence of the program’s benefits and growing evidence of its harm. The ed tech industry and the insistence of its devotees on patronizing parents and depicting their desire to have a voice in how their children are educated lacks any acknowledgement about the way in which venture philanthropists have used their wealth to circumvent democracy, with the goal of privatizing, standardizing and mechanizing education and student data.","Last year Mark Zuckerberg wrote, “We’ll build technology where it can help, and we believe in listening to and working closely with parents, teachers and students to understand the specific needs of the communities we’re working in.” In 2018, perhaps Zuckerberg, Gates and the other data overlords and their vassals should start making a real effort to listen to parents and communities, rather than belittle their concerns and try to force-feed their autocratic and technocratic model of education on children.","But I’m not holding my breath. In November, the Alt School, a Zuckerberg-funded chain of private schools using instructional technology announced it would close at least three of its seven schools. Yet rather than learn the obvious lessons from the observations of disappointed parents who pulled their kids of these schools, the Alt School CEO now says he will focus on marketing their software to public schools. Clearly, parents will have to continue their battle to preserve classrooms focused on human interaction, discussion and debate rather than machine-centered reductionist forms of education.","Join our Coalition","Recent Posts","Next month in Indianapolis, the Network for Public Education will be holding our annual conference on Saturday and Sunday, Oct. 20-21.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

They should be celebrated. We all benefit from them.’\nPhotograph: GETTY IMAGES","When I wrote an about-to-be-published book last year about problems with social media, I thought it would be cute to call it Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now. And then the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, motivating a modest but notable wave of Facebook deletions in protest, including by prominent tech figures such as Elon Musk and Brian Acton, the co-founder of WhatsApp.","So much for the novelty of my book title. The biggest surprise was not the movement to delete accounts, but that the deleters have not been received well by pundits and commentators. The response has often been smug, dismissive, even scolding. Deleters are told they are abusing their privilege; that they are leaving behind the less fortunate, who cannot afford to quit. They are said to be abandoning society or distracting from the more important process of petitioning governments to regulate Facebook. They are accused of tilting at windmills.","But these deleters are indispensable. They should be celebrated. We all benefit from them.","The primary value of a boycott in this case is not mere protest to damage Facebook, but to invent what life can be like today without the social network.","A deleter must reconsider how she holds her social life together. She will therefore rethink what a social life is.","Is having a publicly broadcast number of associates a good thing, or does it foster a meaningless sense of social competition? Does Facebook’s method, which combines user tracking with stimuli calculated to foster addiction and behaviour modification, really reveal the most beneficial options for her? Does an experiential feed constructed by algorithms serve her, or other people who are paying to modify her behaviour? Are the components of the Facebook experience severable or not? Can you have a modern social and professional life without the manipulation? Is it even conceivable? Who will ask? Who will find out? The deleters will!","To suggest that everyone stays in line with the current regime is to cement Facebook’s role as sole designer of a key aspect of the digital future.","Before Facebook, there were ways to do most of the things that Facebook allows, and there still are. There are other ways to keep up with friends, be informed, discover local events, announce your own life events, publish opinions, meet new people, and so on.","I have no social media accounts at all, and yet I am able to maintain a career. It’s possible that Facebook’s highly crafted addictive quality is fostering the illusion that there’s gravity where there isn’t. If you let go, you might find that you’ve lost nothing.","My case is not ideally instructive because I never had social media accounts. But those who have had accounts and then deleted them are true pioneers. They will see things and learn things that are new in the world.","Quitting Facebook is a significant project, just like overcoming any addiction. The company does what it can to make the process difficult and uncertain. It also hoards data and fine-tunes options, which make it hard for people to control what happens with their data, much less leave. The site benefits from network effect, since so many people are on it.","Those who have gone through the exiting process, however, might find that in the end they have not only made a political statement, but saved time and improved their lives.","Since Facebook is designed to take up as much attention as possible, those who find alternate ways to gain the benefits of Facebook will often discover they have more free time. For instance, experimenters have reported that reading news sites directly makes one not only better informed, but less ragged with weird partisan noise, and in possession of an “embarrassing” amount of free time, according to one account.","Part of the reason Facebook has achieved a monopoly is that dealing with diverse digital services is such a tedious pain. It’s stunning how much time we spend carefully entering long strings of letters and numbers into machines. Facebook provides a single account that can attach to many other services. That might be its greatest unique practical value. Even so, everyone I have talked to who has gone to the trouble to fully leave Facebook has found that in the end time was gained.","How can Facebook change when it exists to exploit personal data? | John Naughton","Read more","Ultimately, Facebook deleters should not think of themselves as protesters so much as innovators. If we are to create a survivable digital society, it must be invented and that invention is unlikely to flow from a single company. We cannot create a hi-tech digital civilisation by continuing to complain to Facebook about its counterproductive design. We cannot have regulators trim a beast as if they were barbers and call that change. The act of invention must be distributed.","We must learn to be digital citizens, and we can’t do that when we are herded by a big central digital service. You cannot read well without learning to write at least a little, and in the same way you cannot live well in a digital world without having learned to design such a world at least a little.","Each Facebook deleter must invent new ways to live without Facebook; the deleters are the pioneers, the vanguard of a new kind of literate, informed, proud digital citizenry.

Its shares fell a further 1.8 percent.","In London, the head of Britain’s cross-party Media parliamentary committee also wrote to Zuckerberg asking for more information. “We would like to receive your response by Monday 26 March,” lawmaker Damian Collins wrote.","In Dublin, Ireland’s privacy watchdog said it was following up with Facebook to clarify its oversight. The Irish body is the lead regulator for Facebook in the European Union because the network’s European headquarters are in Dublin.","Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.","According to the New York Times, it was launched with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by the-then future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon.","Facebook says the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also their friends’.","Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.","Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed.","Kogan says he changed the terms and conditions of his personality-test app on Facebook from academic to commercial part way through the project, according to an email to Cambridge University colleagues obtained and cited by CNN.","Kogan says Facebook made no objection, but Facebook says it was not informed of the change, CNN reported. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.","GRAVE VIOLATION","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","On Tuesday people were seen carrying multiple plastic storage containers into and out of the building that houses Cambridge Analytica’s London office, among other companies. It was not clear which firm they were going to.","Slideshow (9 Images)","“We are not alone in using data from social media sites to extract user information,” Cambridge Analytica said. “No Facebook data was used by our data science team in the 2016 presidential campaign.”","Denham, head of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said on Monday she was seeking a warrant to access the offices of Cambridge Analytica after seeing an investigation by Britain’s Channel 4 news which secretly recorded its executives boasting of their ability to sway elections.","She said it would not take long to obtain the warrant.","“We have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection,” Cambridge Analytica said.","Facebook said it had hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to investigate and determine whether Cambridge Analytica still had the data. The auditors were in Cambridge Analytica’s offices on Monday night but left at the request of the British authorities.","The Information Commissioner can currently impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds ($700,000) but will gain the power to fine an organization up to 4 percent of its global turnover when new data protection legislation comes into force in May.","The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","“This story comes on the back of increasing scrutiny and societal unease with FB’s potential impact on kids as well as increasing concerns around the power of mega cap Internet names, setting the stage for deeper investigation,” Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note, keeping his “buy” rating on Facebook stock.","Walmsley said he was worried “about how scrutiny could ultimately impact Facebook’s ability to gather and deploy data for ad targeting, which has been critical to ad efficacy and budget growth”.","The company said last month it had 1.4 billion active daily users, up 14 percent from a year earlier.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

{"originalurl":"http://Millennialsoasis.com/blog/lifestyle/","title":"Lifestyle","text":["Lifestyle","Every generation interprets its circumstances differently, most probably because their circumstances are mostly different in actual reality, and it is not just a figment of their imagination. Be it social issues, economic issues, wars, jobs, politics, or a wide range of other circumstances that make each generation feel that their experience, at their time, is very unique and makes them that result in a unique set of trends that match their interpretations of their circumstances. For instance, with the boomers, the Second World War was still fresh in the memory of their parents and hence they prescribed a new set of social issues such as counterculture and social revolution, civil rights, anti-war, second-wave feminism, gay rights, etc. that they believed would address the challenges of the society and hoped to find an answer to the ills of the society at that time.","With the Millennials, it has to be said that this generation can be defined as the time of reliance on social media. Millennials are more likely to relate to social issues as a major aspect of their lifestyle where they interpret their core connection and inspiration with and within the society being invoked through the social media network whereby they can form human characteristics of empathy for one another while make a strong “loudly-heard” protest against things they disagree with and thing they believe is harming the future of the society, as they see it.","Social media has become such an significant and integral part of their lives and lifestyle that Millennials have incorporated it into their very person life – meeting potential partners and falling in love. This is one of the most significant differences between this new generation and all others before it. Millennials rely on dating apps and social dating sites to meet their soul mate or future partner or even casual encounters, more than any other generation, ever. While dating is one of the hardest challenges and most complicated aspects of a young person’s life, now you can make it so impersonal and public. How embarrassing? Is this the end of courtship in the traditional sense? Or is this a lifestyle change that represents convenience and speed of access rather than the traditional interaction between a couple to find their suitability and compatibility?","The convenience of social media as a tool for courtship certainly allows a wide sampling data. An individual can meet many potential partners before he/she can decide on the most suitable, or one seems as being the most suitable. But then with such a vast pool of choice, can anyone ever be happy with any choice, since there is hardly a perfect choice. And since we are grow as we go through the journey of different stages of our lives, does our desires also change experiencing different stages and reacting to different emptions? Would this be the answer to the Millennials having the lowest expectations of marriage, with a good 30% indicating that they may never get married and just rather live in a civil partnership instead of outright marriage?","Some argue that this is not the result of social changes or lifestyle choices but tied to the fact that most young people have experienced divorce through their parent’s experience and having been raised by divorced parents they have become quite cynical to the idea or concept of traditional marriage.","The social media generation has also looked at problems through the eyes of many peers they connect with or have things in common with, such as sports, hobbies, or political views. Unlike their parents that had experiences with only a few friends local to their vicinity, Millennials think much broader and much more inclusively as a result of social media exposure. That is why this generation is indeed the least sexist generation to date. While previous generations had come to see and accept the different roles of men and women based on clearly defined, although less overtly stated, conformity to gender stereotypes, Millennials are less willing to accept to conform to such narrow views of gender expectations, even in romantic relationships and lifestyle choices. They believe these attitudes are quite inconsistent with reality of today and regard this as undesirable and even ignorance.","Social media also addressed many taboos such as premarital sex and questions the very idea of monogamy. In fact some social media sites poke fun and call it the new monogamy of open relationships. Millennials are embracing the idea that sex and love are different emotions far more than the previous generations did. Additionally, they are inventing many interesting variations from “friends-with-benefits”, to “long-stand not long-term relationship”, where the relationship is a form of “consensual, ethical, and responsible non-monogamy” in which the goal is to have one long-standing relationship while openly expressing and acknowledging that that this relationship might not meet each partner’s long-term relationship needs.","Many of these adaptations of lifestyle choices are based on the fact that there is far less pressure from the society or family to accept the norms of relationships and to settle for a partner in a traditional marriage setting. The Millennials do not accept pressure from their parents or previous generations and want to set a course for themselves and the stigma of an unmarried person places no obstacles in their way.","Free of lifestyle expectations, Millennials are free to experiment and make decisions based on their desires and this has brought a new sense of individual freedom. This is however not just changing the lifestyle of Millennials but also other generations. In fact, baby boomer are outpacing Millennials on apartment rentals. People openly joke around with the idea that 60 is the new 40 and they are active and not want to have a house to take care of, cut the grass, take care of the maintenance and rather instead go out, eat out, be active, meet people, not worry about kids or household chores.","The Millennials just don’t want to be tied down and other generations are learning too."],"isopubdate":""}

The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.","Cambridge has been largely funded by Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to the president who became an early board member and gave the firm its name. It has pitched its services to potential clients ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.","What kind of information was collected, and how was it acquired?","The data, a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook, and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads.","Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app, which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned.","The technique had been developed at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Center. The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing.","Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica.","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use.","Facebook said no passwords or “sensitive pieces of information” had been taken, though information about a user’s location was available to Cambridge.","So was Facebook hacked?","Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was not a data breach, because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes — and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account.","But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred “to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.” It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm.","Dr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","Cambridge Analytica officials, after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data, changed their story last week. In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","But the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","What is Facebook doing in response?","The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan’s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan’s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed.","Facebook also said: “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","In a further step, Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm “to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists.” It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr. Kogan had given a verbal commitment, while Mr. Wylie “thus far has declined.”","What are others saying?","Facebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica. Investors have not been pleased, sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday.","■ In Congress, Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have asked to hold a hearing on Facebook’s links to Cambridge Analytica. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, led by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected.","■ A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebook’s ties to Cambridge Analytica.","■ The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post.

Chris Wylie's claims center around the official Vote Leave campaign and its links to a group called BeLeave, which it helped fund. The links allegedly allowed the campaign to bypass spending rules.","March 28, 2018","In a 3½-hour hearing, Chris Wylie told the House of Commons media committee that he believes the breach exceeded the 50 million Facebook users reported earlier — though he didn't give an exact figure. And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it.","\"All kinds of people had access to the data,\" said Wylie, who helped develop Cambridge Analytica's methods for using the information to target and persuade voters. \"It was everywhere.\" Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ, a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave, the official campaign backing Britain's withdrawal from the EU, Wylie said.","Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company, SCL Group, that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun-for-hire, often in countries where democratic institutions are weak. He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost.","The 28-year-old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013. He left the next year. Wylie has previously alleged that Cambridge Analytica used personal data improperly collected from Facebook users to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign. It denies any wrongdoing. Cambridge Analytica's acting CEO, Alexander Tayler, said in a statement that Wylie was a part-time contractor who \"has no direct knowledge of our work or practices\" since he left the company.","Wylie said he \"absolutely\" believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica's databases for its work on the Brexit campaign. In the closely fought referendum in 2016, 51.9 percent of voters backed Britain's departure from the EU.","\"I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning,\" Wylie said. He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn't want to relocate to Britain. The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a \"department,\" he said.","Because of the links between the two companies, Vote Leave got the \"the next best thing\" to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ, \"a company that can do virtually everything that (Cambridge Analytica) can do but with a different billing name,\" Wylie said.","AggregateIQ, based in Victoria, British Columbia, issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL. \"AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates,\" the company said. \"All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client.\"","Wylie's testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign. They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625,000 pounds ($888,000) to the pro-Brexit student group BeLeave, which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

It's clear these platforms can't police themselves,\" the Minnesota senator said in a statement. \"They say 'trust us,' but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters.\"","The Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington advocacy group, pointed to the revelations as yet another sign that the U.S. lacks strong data privacy protections and called for individual internet users to have \"greater agency and control over their personal data by default.\"","\"Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,\" CDT President and CEO Nuala O'Connor said in a statement. \"While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways.\"","The Times said Cambridge Analytica — which has deep ties to Republican donor Robert Mercer and conservative firebrand Steve Bannon — used the harvested information to build a powerful political tool as political campaigns were increasingly looking to sway voters on popular digital platforms.","The company has denied the claims, which date back to 2014.","In a pair of statements, Cambridge Analytica said it had hired Global Science Research, a company run by U.K. professor Aleksandr Kogan, to conduct a “large scale research project” in the U.S. The company said it was unaware that Kogan’s data violated Facebook’s terms of service and subsequently deleted it at Facebook’s insistence.","“No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,” the company said Saturday. “Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly.”","Facebook, for its part, sought to get ahead of the Times article with an announcement late Friday night that it had suspended Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, as well as a third firm, Eunoia Technologies, from the social network. Facebook said they had collected information from 270,000 users who voluntarily downloaded an app that Kogan created — though friends of those users with more relaxed privacy settings may have also had their data swept up.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice president and deputy general counsel, said in a statement. “Nevertheless, this was a scam. Mr. Kogan misled us all.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook,” Grewal added. “If these reports are true, it's a serious abuse of our rules.”","Nevertheless, the New York Times report will undoubtedly create headaches for both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. Each has come under fire from Washington lawmakers for their involvement in the 2016 president election, which according to U.S. intelligence agencies was marked by interference from Russian actors looking to undermine Hillary Clinton and, eventually, boost Trump’s prospects.","Cambridge has been called upon to provide both information and testimony to congressional and FBI investigators exploring the extent of the election meddling and whether affiliates of the Trump campaign colluded with Russians. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, for example, said last year that CEO Alexander Nix had contacted him in an effort to obtain hacked emails from the Clinton's campaign.","The company’s ties to U.S. conservatives are many. Mercer and Bannon played key roles in helping the company establish a foothold in the U.S. politics, the Times report explains. The company first used data to target voters during the 2014 midterm elections. And before switching to assist the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica was tapped to work on the presidential bid of Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.","Cambridge has also done work for a super PAC created by former U.S. diplomat John Bolton, who's been reported to be a potential candidate for White House national security adviser if Trump dismisses H.R. McMaster.","Meanwhile, Facebook has been hauled to Capitol Hill to face a battery of questions from lawmakers concerned that the network did not do enough to prevent fake news and foreign trolls from manipulating American voters throughout the election cycle. Facebook, Google and Twitter found that ads, pages and fake accounts aiming to stoke political and social discord reached more than 125 million internet users.","The Times story also raises questions about whether Cambridge and SCL may have violated U.S. law by having Canadian or European employees working on contracts for American political campaigns. Cambridge Analytica told the Times that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders,\" the newspaper said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

It might be a wake-up call. - The Washington Post","text":["Here’s how to download all your data from Facebook. It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information. According to Facebook, that download might also include the “unique number” Facebook assigns to you for facial recognition purposes, based on the photos you’ve been tagged in on the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

The Frank Gehry-designed building has a pristine nine-acre rooftop garden, yet much of the interior — a meandering open-plan hallway — appears unfinished. There are exposed air ducts and I-beams scribbled with contractors’ marks. Many of the internal walls are unpainted plywood. The space looks less like the headquarters of one of the world’s wealthiest companies and more like a Chipotle with standing desks. It’s an aesthetic meant to reflect — and perhaps also inspire employee allegiance to — one of Facebook’s founding ideologies: that things are never quite finished, that nothing is permanent, that you should always look for a chance to take an ax to your surroundings.","The mood in overwhelmingly liberal Silicon Valley at the time, days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, was grim. But Zuckerberg, who had recently returned from his 700-acre estate on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, is preternaturally unable to look anything other than excited about the future. “Hey, guys!” he beamed, greeting me and Mike Isaac, a Times colleague who covers Facebook. Zuckerberg wore a short-sleeve gray T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, which is his Steve Jobsian daily uniform: Indoor Zuck.","Zuckerberg used to be a nervous speaker, but he has become much less so. He speaks quickly but often unloads full paragraphs of thought, and sometimes his arguments are so polished that they sound rehearsed, which happened often that morning. “2016 was an interesting year for us,” he said as the three of us, plus a P.R. executive, sat around a couple of couches in the glass-walled conference room where he conducts many of his meetings. (There are many perks to working at Facebook, but no one, not even Zuckerberg, has a private office.) It was an understatement and a nod to the obvious: Facebook, once a mere app on your phone, had become a global political and cultural force, and the full implications of that transformation had begun to come into view last year. “If you look at the history of Facebook, when we started off, there really wasn’t news as part of it,” Zuckerberg went on. But as Facebook grew and became a bigger part of how people learn about the world, the company had been slow to adjust to its new place in people’s lives. The events of 2016, he said, “set off a number of conversations that we’re still in the middle of.”","Nearly two billion people use Facebook every month, about 1.2 billion of them daily. The company, which Zuckerberg co-founded in his Harvard dorm room 13 years ago, has become the largest and most influential entity in the news business, commanding an audience greater than that of any American or European television news network, any newspaper or magazine in the Western world and any online news outlet. It is also the most powerful mobilizing force in politics, and it is fast replacing television as the most consequential entertainment medium. Just five years after its initial public offering, Facebook is one of the 10 highest market-capitalized public companies in the world.","As recently as a year ago, Zuckerberg might have proudly rattled off these facts as a testament to Facebook’s power. But over the course of 2016, Facebook’s gargantuan influence became its biggest liability. During the U.S. election, propagandists — some working for money, others for potentially state-sponsored lulz — used the service to turn fake stories into viral sensations, like the one about Pope Francis’ endorsing Trump (he hadn’t). And fake news was only part of a larger conundrum. With its huge reach, Facebook has begun to act as the great disseminator of the larger cloud of misinformation and half-truths swirling about the rest of media. It sucks up lies from cable news and Twitter, then precisely targets each lie to the partisan bubble most receptive to it.","After studying how people shared 1.25 million stories during the campaign, a team of researchers at M.I.T. and Harvard implicated Facebook and Twitter in the larger failure of media in 2016. The researchers found that social media created a right-wing echo chamber: a “media network anchored around Breitbart developed as a distinct and insulated media system, using social media as a backbone to transmit a hyperpartisan perspective to the world.” The findings partially echoed a long-held worry about social news: that people would use sites like Facebook to cocoon themselves into self-reinforcing bubbles of confirmatory ideas, to the detriment of civility and a shared factual basis from which to make collective, democratic decisions. A week and a half after the election, President Obama bemoaned “an age where there’s so much active misinformation and it’s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television.”","After the election, Zuckerberg offered a few pat defenses of Facebook’s role. “I’m actually quite proud of the impact that we were able to have on civic discourse over all,” he said when we spoke in January. Misinformation on Facebook was not as big a problem as some believed it was, but Facebook nevertheless would do more to battle it, he pledged. Echo chambers were a concern, but if the source was people’s own confirmation bias, was it really Facebook’s problem to solve?","It was hard to tell how seriously Zuckerberg took the criticisms of his service and its increasingly paradoxical role in the world. He had spent much of his life building a magnificent machine to bring people together. By the most literal measures, he’d succeeded spectacularly, but what had that connection wrought? Across the globe, Facebook now seems to benefit actors who want to undermine the global vision at its foundation. Supporters of Trump and the European right-wing nationalists who aim to turn their nations inward and dissolve alliances, trolls sowing cross-border paranoia, even ISIS with its skillful social-media recruiting and propagandizing — all of them have sought in their own ways to split the Zuckerbergian world apart. And they are using his own machine to do it.","In Silicon Valley, current events tend to fade into the background. The Sept. 11 attacks, the Iraq war, the financial crisis and every recent presidential election occurred, for the tech industry, on some parallel but distant timeline divorced from the everyday business of digitizing the world. Then Donald Trump won. In the 17 years I’ve spent covering Silicon Valley, I’ve never seen anything shake the place like his victory. In the span of a few months, the Valley has been transformed from a politically disengaged company town into a center of anti-Trump resistance and fear. A week after the election, one start-up founder sent me a private message on Twitter: “I think it’s worse than I thought,” he wrote. “Originally I thought 18 months. I’ve cut that in half.” Until what? “Apocalypse. End of the world.”","Trump’s campaign rhetoric felt particularly personal for an industry with a proud reliance upon immigrants. Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s campaign chief executive and now chief White House strategist, once suggested that there were too many South Asian chief executives in tech. More than 15 percent of Facebook’s employees are in the United States on H-1B visas, a program that Trump has pledged to revamp. But the outcome also revealed the depth of the Valley’s disconnection with much of the rest of the country. “I saw an election that was just different from the way I think,” says Joshua Reeves, a Bay Area native who is a co-founder of Gusto, a human-resources software start-up. “I have this engineering brain that wants to go to this analytical, rational, nonemotional way of looking at things, and it was clear in this election that we’re trending in a different direction, toward spirited populism.”","Underneath it all was a nagging feeling of complicity. Trump had benefited from a media environment that is now shaped by Facebook — and, more to the point, shaped by a single Facebook feature, the same one to which the company owes its remarkable ascent to social-media hegemony: the computationally determined list of updates you see every time you open the app. The list has a formal name, News Feed. But most users are apt to think of it as Facebook itself.","If it’s an exaggeration to say that News Feed has become the most influential source of information in the history of civilization, it is only slightly so. Facebook created News Feed in 2006 to solve a problem: In the social-media age, people suddenly had too many friends to keep up with. At the time, Facebook was just a collection of profiles, lacking any kind of central organization. To figure out what any of your connections were up to, you had to visit each of their profiles to see if anything had changed. News Feed fixed that. Every time you open Facebook, it hunts through the network, collecting every post from every connection — information that, for most Facebook users, would be too overwhelming to process themselves. Then it weighs the merits of each post before presenting you with a feed sorted in order of importance: a hyperpersonalized front page designed just for you.","Image","The News Feed team at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.CreditSpencer Lowell for The New York Times","Scholars and critics have been warning of the solipsistic irresistibility of algorithmic news at least since 2001, when the constitutional-law professor Cass R. Sunstein warned, in his book “Republic.com,” of the urgent risks posed to democracy “by any situation in which thousands or perhaps millions or even tens of millions of people are mainly listening to louder echoes of their own voices.” (In 2008, I piled on with my own book, “True Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society.”) In 2011, the digital activist and entrepreneur Eli Pariser, looking at similar issues, gave this phenomenon a memorable name in the title of his own book: “The Filter Bubble.”","Facebook says its own researchers have been studying the filter bubble since 2010. In 2015, they published an in-house study, which was criticized by independent researchers, concluding that Facebook’s effect on the diversity of people’s information diet was minimal. News Feed’s personalization algorithm did filter out some opposing views in your feed, the study claimed, but the bigger effect was users’ own choices. When News Feed did show people views contrary to their own, they tended not to click on the stories. For Zuckerberg, the finding let Facebook off the hook. “It’s a good-sounding theory, and I can get why people repeat it, but it’s not true,” he said on a call with analysts last summer.","Employees got the same message. “When Facebook cares about something, they spin up teams to address it, and Zuck will come out and talk about it all the time,” one former executive told me. “I have never heard of anything close to that on the filter bubble. I never sensed that this was a problem he wanted us to tackle. It was always positioned as an interesting intellectual question but not something that we’re going to go focus on.”","Then, last year, Facebook’s domination of the news became a story itself. In May, Gizmodo reported that some editors who had worked on Facebook’s Trending Topics section had been suppressing conservative points of view. To smooth things over, Zuckerberg convened a meeting of conservative media figures and eventually significantly reduced the role of human editors. Then in September, Facebook deleted a post by a Norwegian writer that included the photojournalist Nick Ut’s iconic photo of a naked 9-year-old girl, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, running in terror after a napalm attack during the Vietnam War, on the grounds that it ran afoul of Facebook’s prohibition of child nudity.","Facebook, under criticism, reinstated the picture, but the photo incident stuck with Zuckerberg. He would bring it up unbidden to staff members and to reporters. It highlighted, for him, the difficulty of building a policy framework for what Facebook was trying to do. Zuckerberg wanted to become a global news distributor that is run by machines, rather than by humans who would try to look at every last bit of content and exercise considered judgment. “It’s something I think we’re still figuring out,” he told me in January. “There’s a lot more to do here than what we’ve done. And I think we’re starting to realize this now as well.”","It struck me as an unsatisfying answer, and it later became apparent that Zuckerberg seemed to feel the same way. On a Sunday morning about a month after the first meeting, I got a call from a Facebook spokesman. Zuckerberg wanted to chat again. Could Mike and I come back on Monday afternoon?","We met again in the same conference room. Same Zuck outfit, same P.R. executive. But the Zuckerberg who greeted us seemed markedly different. He was less certain in his pronouncements than he had been the month before, more expansive and questioning. Earlier that day, Zuckerberg’s staff had sent me a draft of a 5,700-word manifesto that, I was told, he spent weeks writing. The document, “Building Global Community,” argued that until now, Facebook’s corporate goal had merely been to connect people. But that was just Step 1. According to the manifesto, Facebook’s “next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community — for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all.” If it was a nebulous crusade, it was also vast in its ambition.","The last manifesto that Zuckerberg wrote was in 2012, as part of Facebook’s application to sell its stock to the public. It explained Facebook’s philosophy — what he called “the hacker way” — and sketched an unorthodox path for the soon-to-be-public company. “Facebook was not originally created to be a company,” he wrote. “It was built to accomplish a social mission: to make the world more open and connected.”","What’s striking about that 2012 letter, read through the prism of 2017, is its certainty that a more “open and connected” world is by definition a better one. “When I started Facebook, the idea of connecting the world was not controversial,” Zuckerberg said now. “The default assumption was that the world was incrementally just moving in that direction. So I thought we can connect some people and do our part in helping move in that direction.” But now, he said, whether it was wise to connect the world was “actually a real question.”","Zuckerberg’s new manifesto never quite accepts blame for any of the global ills that have been laid at Facebook’s feet. Yet by the standards of a company release, it is remarkable for the way it concedes that the company’s chief goal — wiring the globe — is controversial. “There are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone,” Zuckerberg writes, “and whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course.” He also confesses misgivings about Facebook’s role in the news. “Giving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared,” he writes. “But the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality.”","At the time of our second interview, the manifesto was still only a draft, and I was surprised by how unsure Zuckerberg seemed about it in person. He had almost as many questions for us — about whether we understood what he was trying to say, how we thought it would land in the media — as we had for him. When I suggested that it might be perceived as an attack on Trump, he looked dismayed. He noted several times that he had been noodling over these ideas since long before November. A few weeks earlier, there was media speculation, fueled by a postelection tour of America by Zuckerberg and his wife, that he was laying the groundwork to run against Trump in 2020, and in this meeting he took pains to shoot down the rumors. When I asked if he had chatted with Obama about the former president’s critique of Facebook, Zuckerberg paused for several seconds, nearly to the point of awkwardness, before answering that he had.","Facebook’s spokespeople later called to stress that Obama was only one of many people to whom he had spoken. In other words: Don’t read this as a partisan anti-Trump manifesto. But if the company pursues the admittedly airy aims outlined in “Building Global Community,” the changes will echo across media and politics, and some are bound to be considered partisan. The risks are especially clear for changes aimed at adding layers of journalistic ethics across News Feed, which could transform the public’s perception of Facebook, not to mention shake the foundations of its business.","Image","Mark Zuckerberg at his desk. No one at the company has a private office.CreditSpencer Lowell for The New York Times","The Facebook app, and consequently News Feed, is run by one of Zuckerberg’s most influential lieutenants, a 34-year-old named Chris Cox, the company’s chief product officer. Ten years ago, Cox dropped out of a graduate program in computer science at Stanford to join Facebook. One of his first assignments was on the team that created News Feed. Since then, he has become an envoy to the media industry. Don Graham, the longtime publisher of The Washington Post who was for years a member of Facebook’s board, told me that he felt Cox, among Facebook staff, “was at the 99.9th percentile of interest in news. He thought it was important to society, and he wanted Facebook to get it right.”","For the typical user, Cox explained when I met him on a morning in October at MPK20, News Feed is computing the relative merits of about 2,000 potential posts in your network every time you open the app. In sorting these posts, Facebook does not optimize for any single metric: not clicks or reading time or likes. Instead, he said, “what you really want to get to is whether somebody, at the end of the day, would say, ‘Hey, my experience today was meaningful.’ ” Personalizing News Feed, in other words, is a very big “math problem,” incorporating countless metrics in extraordinarily complicated ways. Zuckerberg calls it “a modern A.I. problem.”","Last summer, I sat in on two meetings in another glass-walled MPK20 conference room, in which News Feed’s engineers, designers, user-research experts and managers debated several small alterations to how News Feed displays certain kinds of posts. The conversations were far from exciting — people in jeans on couches looking at PowerPoints, talking quietly about numbers — and yet I found them mesmerizing, a demonstration of the profound cultural differences between how news companies like The Times work and how Facebook does. The first surprise was how slowly things move, contrary to the freewheeling culture of “the hacker way.” In one meeting, the team spent several minutes discussing the merits of bold text in a certain News Feed design. One blessing of making social software is that you can gauge any potential change to your product by seeing how your users react to it. That is also the curse: At Facebook, virtually every change to the app, no matter how small or obviously beneficial, is thoroughly tested on different segments of the audience before it’s rolled out to everyone.","The people who work on News Feed aren’t making decisions that turn on fuzzy human ideas like ethics, judgment, intuition or seniority. They are concerned only with quantifiable outcomes about people’s actions on the site. That data, at Facebook, is the only real truth. And it is a particular kind of truth: The News Feed team’s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want — what they find “meaningful,” to use Cox and Zuckerberg’s preferred term — and to give them more of that.","This ideal runs so deep that the people who make News Feed often have to put aside their own notions of what’s best. “One of the things we’ve all learned over the years is that our intuition can be wrong a fair amount of the time,” John Hegeman, the vice president of product management and a News Feed team member, told me. “There are things you don’t expect will happen. And we learn a lot from that process: Why didn’t that happen, and what might that mean?” But it is precisely this ideal that conflicts with attempts to wrangle the feed in the way press critics have called for. The whole purpose of editorial guidelines and ethics is often to suppress individual instincts in favor of some larger social goal. Facebook finds it very hard to suppress anything that its users’ actions say they want. In some cases, it has been easier for the company to seek out evidence that, in fact, users don’t want these things at all.","Facebook’s two-year-long battle against “clickbait” is a telling example. Early this decade, the internet’s headline writers discovered the power of stories that trick you into clicking on them, like those that teasingly withhold information from their headlines: “Dustin Hoffman Breaks Down Crying Explaining Something That Every Woman Sadly Already Experienced.” By the fall of 2013, clickbait had overrun News Feed. Upworthy, a progressive activism site co-founded by Pariser, the author of “The Filter Bubble,” that relied heavily on teasing headlines, was attracting 90 million readers a month to its feel-good viral posts.","If a human editor ran News Feed, she would look at the clickbait scourge and make simple, intuitive fixes: Turn down the Upworthy knob. But Facebook approaches the feed as an engineering project rather than an editorial one. When it makes alterations in the code that powers News Feed, it’s often only because it has found some clear signal in its data that users are demanding the change. In this sense, clickbait was a riddle. In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them? Was there something Facebook’s algorithm was missing, some signal that would show that despite the clicks, clickbait was really sickening users?","To answer these questions, Cox and his team hired survey panels of more than a thousand paid “professional raters” around the world who answer questions about how well News Feed is working. Starting in 2013, Facebook began adding first dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of data points that were meant to teach the artificial-intelligence system that runs News Feed how people were reacting to their feeds. Facebook noticed that people would sometimes click open a clickbaity story but spend very little time on it. In other cases, lots of people would click on a story but few would share or Like it. Headlines on stories that people seemed to reject often contained a set of signature phrases (“you’ll never believe,” “this one trick,” etc.) or they came from a set of repeat-offender publishers.","The more such signals Facebook incorporated into the feed, the more clickbait began to drop out of the feed. Since its 2013 peak, Upworthy’s traffic has declined; it now averages 17.5 million visitors a month. The site has since disavowed clickbait. “We sort of unleashed a monster,” Peter Koechley, Upworthy’s co-founder, told a conference in 2015. “Sorry for that.”","Cox suggested that it was not exactly correct to say that Facebook, as a company, decided to fight clickbait. What actually happened was that Facebook found better ways to listen to users, who were themselves rejecting clickbait. “That comes out of good-quality panels and measurement systems, rather than an individual decision saying, ‘Hey, I really want us to care about clickbait,’ ” he says.","This approach — looking for signs of user dissatisfaction — could curb stories that constitute the most egregious examples of misinformation. Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s vice president in charge of News Feed, says that Facebook has begun testing an algorithm change that would look at whether people share an article after reading it. If few of the people who click on a story decide to share it, that might suggest people feel misled by it and it would get lower billing in the feed.","But the solution to the broader misinformation dilemma — the pervasive climate of rumor, propaganda and conspiracy theories that Facebook has inadvertently incubated — may require something that Facebook has never done: ignoring the likes and dislikes of its users. Facebook believes the pope-endorses-Trump type of made-up news stories are only a tiny minority of pieces that appear in News Feed; they account for a fraction of 1 percent of the posts, according to Mosseri. The question the company faces now is whether the misinformation problem resembles clickbait at all, and whether its solutions will align as neatly with Facebook’s worldview. Facebook’s entire project, when it comes to news, rests on the assumption that people’s individual preferences ultimately coincide with the public good, and that if it doesn’t appear that way at first, you’re not delving deeply enough into the data. By contrast, decades of social-science research shows that most of us simply prefer stuff that feels true to our worldview even if it isn’t true at all and that the mining of all those preference signals is likely to lead us deeper into bubbles rather than out of them.","After the election, Margaret Sullivan, the Washington Post columnist and a former public editor of The Times, called on Facebook to hire an executive editor who would monitor News Feed with an eye to fact-checking, balance and editorial integrity. Jonah Peretti, the founder of BuzzFeed, told me that he wanted Facebook to use its data to create a kind of reputational score for online news, as well as explore ways of strengthening reporting through monetary partnerships.","“At some point, if they really want to address this, they have to say, ‘This is good information’ and ‘This is bad information,’ ” says Emily Bell, the director for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School. “They have to say, ‘These are the kinds of information sources that we want to privilege, and these others are not going to be banned from the platform, but they are not going to thrive.’ In other words, they have to create a hierarchy, and they’re going to have to decide how they’re going to transfer wealth into the publishing market.”","There aren’t many technical reasons Facebook could not implement such plans. The hurdles are institutional and philosophical, and ultimately financial too. Late last year, Facebook outlined a modest effort to curb misinformation. News Feed would now carry warning labels: If a friend shares a viral story that has been flagged and shot down by one of Facebook’s fact-checking partners (including Snopes and PolitiFact), you’ll be cautioned that the piece has been “disputed.” But even that slight change has been met with fury on the right, with Breitbart and The Daily Caller fuming that Facebook had teamed up with liberal hacks motivated by partisanship. If Facebook were to take more significant action, like hiring human editors, creating a reputational system or paying journalists, the company would instantly become something it has long resisted: a media company rather than a neutral tech platform.","In many ways, the worry over how Facebook changes the news is really a manifestation of a grander problem with News Feed, which is simply dominance itself. News Feed’s aggressive personalization wouldn’t be much of an issue if it weren’t crowding out every other source. “To some degree I feel like the Pottery Barn Rule applies,” says Pariser, the Upworthy chief executive. “They play a critical role in our information circulatory system, and so — lucky them — all of the problems therein are significantly on their shoulders.”","During our first meeting in January, I posed this question to Zuckerberg: “When you see various problems in the media, do you say to yourself, ‘I run Facebook, I can solve that?’ ”","“Um,” he started, and then paused, weighing his words as carefully as American presidents once did. “Not usually.” He argued that some of Facebook’s critics’ proposed fixes for news on the service, such as hiring editors, were impractical due to Facebook’s scale and global diversity. Personalization, he said, remained a central tenet. “It really gets back to, like, what do people want at a deep level,” he said. “There’s this oversimplified narrative that a company can get very successful by just scratching a very superficial itch, and I don’t really think that’s right over the long term.”","Yet by our second meeting, Zuckerberg’s position seemed to have evolved. Facebook had by then announced plans for the Facebook Journalism Project, in which the company would collaborate with news companies on new products. Facebook also created a project to promote “news literacy” among its users, and it hired the former CNN news anchor Campbell Brown to manage the partnership between it and news companies. Zuckerberg’s tone toward critics of Facebook’s approach to news had also grown far more conciliatory. “I think it’s really important to get to the core of the actual problem,” he said. “I also really think that the core social thing that needs to happen is that a common understanding needs to exist. And misinformation I view as one of the things that can possibly erode common understanding. But sensationalism and polarization and other things, I actually think, are probably even stronger and more prolific effects. And we have to work on all these things. I think we need to listen to all the feedback on this.”","Still, in both our conversation and his new manifesto, Zuckerberg remained preoccupied with the kind of problems that could be solved by the kind of hyperconnectivity he believed in, not the ones caused by it. “There’s a social infrastructure that needs to get built for modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,” he said. “Having more people oriented not just toward short-term things but toward building the long-term social infrastructure that needs to get built across all these things in order to enable people to come together is going to be a really important thing over the next decades.” By way of example, he pointed to Safety Check, Facebook’s system for letting people tell their friends that they’ve survived some kind of dangerous event, like a natural disaster or terrorist attack.","“We’re getting to a point where the biggest opportunities I think in the world ... problems like preventing pandemics from spreading or ending terrorism, all these things, they require a level of coordination and connection that I don’t think can only be solved by the current systems that we have,” Zuckerberg told me. What’s needed, he argues, is some global superstructure to advance humanity.","This is not an especially controversial idea; Zuckerberg is arguing for a kind of digital-era version of the global institution-building that the Western world engaged in after World War II. But because he is a chief executive and not an elected president, there is something frightening about his project. He is positioning Facebook — and, considering that he commands absolute voting control of the company, he is positioning himself — as a critical enabler of the next generation of human society. A minor problem with his mission is that it drips with megalomania, albeit of a particularly sincere sort. With his wife, Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg has pledged to give away nearly all of his wealth to a variety of charitable causes, including a long-term medical-research project to cure all disease. His desire to take on global social problems through digital connectivity, and specifically through Facebook, feels like part of the same impulse.","Yet Zuckerberg is often blasé about the messiness of the transition between the world we’re in and the one he wants to create through software. Building new “social infrastructure” usually involves tearing older infrastructure down. If you manage the demolition poorly, you might undermine what comes next. In the case of the shattering media landscape, Zuckerberg seems finally to have at least noticed this problem and may yet come up with fixes for it. But in the meantime, Facebook rushes headlong into murky new areas, uncovering new dystopian possibilities at every turn.","A few months after I spoke with Zuckerberg, Facebook held its annual developer conference in San Jose, Calif. At last year’s show, Zuckerberg introduced an expanded version of Facebook’s live streaming service which had been promised to revolutionize how we communicate. In the year since, Live had generated iconic scenes of protest, but it was also used to broadcast a terrorist attack in Munich and at least one suicide. Hours before Zuckerberg’s appearance at the conference, police announced that a Cleveland man who had killed a stranger and posted a video on Facebook had shot himself after a manhunt.","But as he took the stage in San Jose, Zuckerberg was ebullient. He started with a few dad jokes and threatened to read his long manifesto on stage. For a brief moment, there was a shift in tone: Statesman Zuck. “In all seriousness, this is an important time to work on building community,” he said. He offered Facebook’s condolences to the victim in Cleveland; the incident, he said, reminded Facebook that “we have a lot more to do.”","Just as quickly, though, Zuckerberg then pivoted to Facebook’s next marvel, a system for digitally augmenting your pictures and videos. The technical term for this is “augmented reality.” The name bursts with dystopian possibilities — fake news on video rather than just text — but Zuckerberg never mentioned them. The statesman had left the stage; before us stood an engineer.","Farhad Manjoo is a technology columnist for The New York Times.

On Saturday, we learned why: The firm played a role in secretly harvesting data belonging to more than 50 million users.","On Sunday, a third bomb dropped: Joseph Chancellor, currently a researcher at Facebook, may be connected to this whole mess.","A Sunday report from CNN reveals that Chancellor previously served as a director of Global Science Research (GSR). When whistleblower Christopher Wylie teamed up with Cambridge University's Aleksandr Kogan to develop an app that could harvest Facebook user data, GSR was the company that data funneled through.","It's not clear what Chancellor knew about GSR's data collection practices, if he knew anything. CNN points out that Chancellor and Kogan were both listed as directors when GSR incorporated in May 2014, according to U.K. government records, but Cambridge Analytica claims \"no recollection\" of any emails or calls with Chancellor.","Kogan and Wylie have both been suspended from Facebook while the investigation plays out. Chancellor, who hasn't personally commented, continues to work at Facebook, and the social media company confirmed to CNN that it is \"looking into the situation.\"","In 2014, Kogan and Wylie built an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" that paid participants for taking a personality test.

Along with the story, he shared with the paper a dossier containing emails, bank records, and other evidence pointing to GSR's data collection and the company's connection to Cambridge Analytica.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Second, the platform wasn’t just looking for scale for scale’s sake. “We want to be deeper with our community,” he said.","So House of Highlights turned to YouTube, joining a growingnumberof publishers and even famous athletes that see the Google-owned video service as the preferred platform to reach their core audience and reap some revenue in return.","A year ago, NBA star Kevin Durant was looking to reconnect with fans after switching teams. Durant and Rich Kleiman, his manager and co-founder of Thirty Five Media, sidestepped the other big platforms and met with YouTube’s top brass, including CEO Susan Wojcicki, chief business officer Robert Kyncl and chief product officer Neal Mohan. Kleiman already knew how big an audience YouTube had, but he came away from the meeting understanding how big YouTube stars had become and seeing that other athletes had not taken advantage of the platform.","“We just felt like, ‘Well, we spend all our time on YouTube consuming sports content, but none of it is original content or first-person content or docu-style content that we would normally create for another platform,” Kleiman said.","Durant’s YouTube channel launched in April 2017 — Kleiman likened it to Derek Jeter’s Player’s Tribune or LeBron James’ Uninterrupted — and after a strong reception from fans, Durant and Kleiman are trying to bring other athletes onto the platform. In January, Thirty Five Media announced a deal with YouTube to create YouTube channels for athletes, including NFL star Richard Sherman and NBA star Karl-Anthony Towns.","Safe harbor for publishers\nWhile Facebook Watch hasn’t taken off as a revenue source for publishers and the social network has deprioritized publisher content, YouTube offers something of a safe harbor for publishers that want to get into the video business. For example, publishers can direct-sell into their video on YouTube, said Kai Hsing, svp of marketing and operations at Bustle, which recently rekindled its interest in YouTube. YouTube was the most lucrative platform for publishers after Facebook, according to a Digital Content Next report.","Publishers also recognize that people are going to YouTube specifically to watch videos. That’s a reason parenting publication Fatherly recently resurrected its YouTube channel. In January, Fatherly hired Adam Banicki, a former video producer at Vice, as its first vp of video. In February, it began uploading videos to its YouTube channel for the first time since June 2017.","“We all had the sense that the gross tonnage of views on Facebook was hitting a certain peak, and also, as a platform, Facebook didn’t have the same degree of intentional viewership that a platform like YouTube did,” said Fatherly CEO Mike Rothman.","Intentional viewing\nProducing serialized shows for YouTube also gives publishers a way to try out programs that TV networks or streaming services may want to develop into long-form programming. Both Comedy Central’s “Broad City” and HBO’s “Insecure” originated as YouTube channels. Publishers that are new to YouTube are looking hopefully to this opportunity.","“Because we’re dealing with more intentional viewers, [YouTube] serves as a better test bed than Facebook for launching teasers for longer-form programming, where the monetization strategy can be taking a pilot concept that’s worked over a couple episodes on YouTube and then pitch to OTT or some other off-platform partner that can help us monetize through production financing and some kind of revenue split beyond that,” said Rothman.","House of Highlights’ YouTube channel has only been up for a little more than a month, but the publisher is already exploring original, scripted shows as an alternative to the highlight reels it has primarily been uploading.","“YouTube is a place that favors long-form viewing,” Bernstein said. “It’s also more appointment viewing. On Facebook or other platforms, you scroll by, and it’s the surprise element.”","Thirty Five Media has also been producing shows for Durant’s YouTube channel, including “Parking Lot Chronicles” starring Durant’s teammate JaVale McGee and a comedy series featuring actor Michael Rapaport. And Kleiman has been meeting with YouTube about producing episodic shows for YouTube Red, the platform’s subscription service.","“Instead of always having to sell a project, we can put something out on our YouTube channel and start to build a fan base and almost upstream it to YouTube Red or anywhere else on YouTube if the show takes off, or it could get picked up by major networks,” said Kleiman.","But for all the value that media companies are seeing in YouTube, they have to be wary of overinvesting in it, as with any one platform, or expecting the money to come overnight.","Refinery29 began putting a bigger focus on YouTube a year and a half ago, and in the second half of 2017, the publisher began focusing more on series to cultivate regular viewership.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone – including the Trump campaign – who might potentially use this data from Facebook’s platform."],"isopubdate":""}

He alleges that because 270,000 people took the quiz, more data was harvested - mostly from the US - via their friend networks. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have disputed those numbers.","Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people to help the company with their work on Donald Trump's presidential election campaign. The data company said none of the data was used for their work with President Trump's campaign.","Facebook sources claim that Zuckerberg has come to terms with the fact that escalating pressure from the media, politicians and the public means he will have to testify before Congress within a matter of weeks, according to CNN Money.","It would appear that the CEO has decided that Washington, not London will be the place where he will face questions, with Facebook currently planning the strategy for his testimony.

Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn't disclosed it until now.","The developments are the latest to show how people try to exploit Facebook in ways that could sway elections, and in the worst cases even undermine democracy. Before the Cambridge imbroglio, there were Russian agents running election-related propaganda campaigns through targeted ads and fake political events.","Wylie claimed Cambridge Analytica used the data it had while speaking with Russian businesses. He also said that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, what's different here is that people wouldn't know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.","Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing and said it deleted all data it received from a contractor after learning the data had been obtained in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of that data was used in its 2016 election work for the \"avoidance of doubt.\" President Donald Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","Wylie left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and it's not clear how the firm targeted people with misinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign. What is clear is that two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according on Pew Research Center, and about 20 percent do so \"often.\" While people don't exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the \"rabbit hole\" of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described.","While Wylie said he doesn't know whether Trump's campaign used the techniques, he said Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was meeting with Cambridge Analytica in 2015, before Trump even announced his run for office.","Never miss a story","Choose the plan that's right for you.\nDigital access or digital and print delivery."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

But this may be just the beginning of a wider public backlash against Facebook and many other big tech firms.","Opinion","In coming months, you will probably hear growing public complaints about what Facebook and other social media and streaming companies could be doing to your health, aside from criticism of their violations of people’s privacy rights and their failure to stop Russian disinformation campaigns.","Facebook’s stock fell more than 10 percent in recent days after the company admitted that Cambridge Analytica used private information from Facebook users to help Donald Trump win the presidential election. More than a half dozen congressional committees, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Union are looking into the matter.","Be the first to know.","No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.","Last year, under intense public criticism, Facebook conceded that up to 126 million Americans may have seen posts by a Russian troll farm that used bogus Facebook identities to exacerbate political tensions and spread pro-Trump propaganda.","Now, on top of all of that, we are likely to see more of an uproar over the alleged efforts of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Netflix and other big technology firms to turn us into “tech addicts.”","Former employees of Silicon Valley tech firms have launched a campaign, titled “The Truth about Tech,” to educate people about the dangers of “tech addiction.” They cite studies asserting that constant connectivity to smart phones and tablets may cause depression, attention deficit disorder and other psychological problems in many people, especially youngsters.","The $57 million campaign – its founders say they have $7 million in cash and $50 million in donated media advertising time – will be aimed mostly at students in 55,000 U.S. public schools and their parents. It also will lobby for legislation to commission research on technology’s impact on children.","What makes this campaign different is that its founders are accusing Facebook, Twitter and other tech companies of intentionally creating applications aimed at making us tech addicts. Tech addiction is not an unwanted by-product of technology, but a deliberate result of what these companies do, they say.","Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google and co-founder of the campaign, told me in a recent interview that the stock value of social media and streaming companies does not depend on their number of followers, but on their users’ “engagement time.”","In other words, investors are mostly interested in how much time we spend on a social media or streaming platform. That’s why computer engineers at big tech companies are paid to find ways to keep our eyeballs constantly fixed on their platforms, Harris says.","Tech companies have borrowed many ideas from gambling, he says. For instance, much like when we play with slot machines, our smart phones are designed to make us scroll down our emails or pull down constantly to refresh our Twitter messages.","“Every time you check your phone, you’re playing a slot machine to see what you got,” Harris told me. “It’s a variable reward, because sometimes you have new tweets or sometimes you have new messages, and sometimes you don’t. And that makes it intrinsically addictive.”","Netflix and other streaming platforms use similar techniques to keep us hooked, he says. Whereas in the past Netflix asked you to press a “yes” button if you wanted to watch the next episode of a TV series, now it automatically starts the next episode unless you take an active step to stop it.","As a result, many people are sleeping fewer hours – which is bad for their health – because they watch TV series late into the night, he says.","Harris says he’s not advocating that people stop using social media. Instead, he suggests taking steps such as turning off notification applications designed to keep us constantly hooked to our smartphones.","As a semi-tech addict who spends considerable time on Twitter and Facebook, I welcome the growing public demand to hold tech companies accountable for privacy violations, fake news distribution and tech addiction. Technology is great, and makes our lives more enjoyable, but we must control it, rather than letting it control us."],"isopubdate":""}

Because I know that they could have prevented it.’\nPhotograph: Robert Gumpert","Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.","Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.","Where's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds","Read more","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.","Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

When someone or a corporation gives something of value to a campaign for free, the amount of it’s value must be under the legal limits of the law and must be recorded as an “in kind” payment by the campaign and the giver. Election law says you cannot accept free gifts such as office space. You must pay the fair market rate. Bobby Rush just had to pay back rent from space he got for free. It cost him $14,600.","The Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica to gather data but the campaign paid them and the payments are recorded in the campaign filings. The Trump campaign is not responsible if Cambridge Analytica did anything unethical or illegal. Say you hire a contractor to put a new roof on your house. You are not responsible if the contractor stole the shingles from a lumber yard.","However, the Obama campaign was well aware of what they were getting and it’s market value. And of course Facebook was giving Obama for free something they normally sold for a lot of money. Hence, both knew what they were doing was illegal.","According to Carol Davidsen, the former media director for Obama for America, Facebook gave the 2012 Obama campaign direct access to the personal data of Facebook users in violation of its internal rules, making a special exception for the campaign. The Daily Mail, a British newspaper, reported that Davidsen saidon Twitter March 18 that Facebook employees came to the campaign office and “were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.”","The type of data that the Obama campaign was mining from Facebook is a more sophisticated version of the type of data that has long been provided by professional direct mail marketers – something pioneered by Richard Viguerie. Viguerie, for example, has detailed personal data on “12 million conservative donors and activists” to whom his company sends letters and emails on behalf of his clients. He provides information to campaigns looking for votes and money, and to nonprofit and advocacy organizations raising funds.","But you can bet your last dollar the lamestream press will only make Trump’s legal transaction the focus of their stories and will leave out the facts behind what Obama did,","Join The Conversation!","We have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, vulgarity, profanity, all caps, or discourteous behavior.

Now it turns out that much of that data was obtained fraudulently.","The firm “harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission,” according to a major New York Times investigation published Saturday, “making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.”","Cambridge Analytica, which is backed by billionaire conservative donor Robert Mercer and has former Trump strategist Steve Bannon on its board, is already under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible connections to Russian interference in the election. It’s also under investigation by the UK Parliament for potential violations of data privacy and claims it did illegal work for the pro-Brexit campaign.","Now Facebook VP and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal has accused the firm of running “a scam and a fraud,” as he described it to the New York Times.","Advertisement","“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica,” Grewal, a former federal judge, explained in his statement.","Moreover, when Facebook learned in 2015 that Kogan, a Russian-American academic, had broken their rules, “we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","But that certification appears to have been a lie. The Times reported Saturday: “Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.” It added that “copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control,” but the paper was able to view “a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.”","The bottom line of the Times investigation, which it conducted with The Observer of London, is chilling: The data theft “allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate” for the purposes of electing the Trump campaign, which paid the firm millions of dollars in the last several months of the 2016 campaign.","Not only was that data used for microtargeting voters, but by tracking the response to those messages in real time on social media, the firm could advise the campaign where Trump should visit and what words would resonate most with voters in the region.","Advertisement","In fact, Breitbart executive board chair Steve Bannon, who became CEO of the Trump campaign in mid-August 2016, told Bloomberg in late October of that year, “I wouldn’t have come aboard, even for Trump, if I hadn’t known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine. Facebook is what propelled Breitbart to a massive audience. We know its power.”","The Facebook statement and New York Times investigations add important new information in our understanding of the shady role Cambridge Analytica played in the campaign. We also know that disgraced former national security advisor Michael Flynn had been an advisor to the firm, and as the Wall Street Journal reported in October, its CEO Alexander Nix had “reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to offer help organizing the Hillary Clinton-related emails the website was releasing,”","The full story of Cambridge’s role is unlikely to be known until Robert Mueller finishes his investigation."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Now we know.","The Cambridge Analytica outrage is now a major scandal — both financially and morally — for the multibillion-dollar business.","Surprisingly, and disappointingly for some, the scandal is not about politics or elections. Instead it’s the massive internal breach of data; the attempted cover-up; the failure in duty of care by the tech giant and a cratering of trust. This despite Facebook spin and the ready co-operation of the anti-Trump sections of the media.","Make no mistake, this is a Facebook data breach that was sanctioned “in-house”. The profit was enormous. The surging Cambridge Analytica humiliation is about personal data and its misuse for financial gain. No matter how Team Zuckerberg attempts to duck this perfidy. No matter how the hooded bots attempt to abrogate blame. No matter how deftly they dodge criticism or responsibility in Menlo Park, the fact remains – this is a data breach, and Facebook is complicit.","“We have rules” sputtered a spokesperson. Facebook denies there has been any kind of breach by parsing words via twitter… “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked,” tweeted one Facebook executive. At best the deflection is a startlingly feeble, unsophisticated attempt to obfuscate. At worst, it is simply untrue. The Guardian, the newspaper that broke the story referred to the data misuse as a “breach,”.","Let’s assume for a moment that Facebook is the victim. Close your eyes and really concentrate. Facebook says it learned of Cambridge Analytica’sprivate database in 2015. One must then assume they moved immediately to protect users and disclose the breach? Well, no actually, they didn’t. Facebook admitted the breach only after the British media revealed that more than 50 million Facebook users had been compromised….in March 2018.","Over the last decade how many developers have simply worked around Facebook’s rules – which permitted caching data – and made their own databases? Where is that information now? Is the private user data as powerful as Cambridge Analytica claims? If so what has it been used for? Is there another, larger CA style balloon about to drop?","Given this debacle has cost Facebook $60 Billion (yes that is a “B”) and betrayed the trust of tens of millions, what is Facebook doing to make amends? As it turns out, very little. Seems the big kahunas are cowering behind the Frappuccino machine. As the bombshell hit, Facebook employees were summonsed, steaming mocha in hand, to an “all hands” meeting. Mark Zuckerberg the CEO and COO Sheryl Sandberg, both stated champions of transparency, were reportedly AWOL. As a consolation prize they sent the company’s second-string lawyer. To add insult to injury, he was in a suit and tie.","To date, government bureaucracies have proven inept at keeping pace with the media ecosystem. This is not politically driven, it is technological and cultural. Television broadcasters, for instance have Federal Communications Commission rules that require public disclosure of campaign ad buys. Facebook, Twitter et al do not. Perhaps a simple solution is to require campaigns to disclose their online advertising buys? Seems modest enough.","Fundamentally, the issue is about privacy, trust and corporate responsibility — not politics. Since 2016, I would argue, Facebook has progressively contributed to the dislocation and decay of America’s political system. Sure, overpaid political consultants, Vlad Putin’s henchmen and snake oil salesmen have all embraced Facebook’s tools. They are selling us goods, services and Senators, via Zuckerberg’s platform – created and unleashed with few safeguards. Call it campaign meddling, psychological warfare or simply business as usual. Just remember, if your data is misused and privacy is compromised, it’s a data breach, brought to you by your friends at Facebook. Can we “unlike” yet?","Gregory Keeley is a retired Lt Commander with service in both the United States Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. He is a veteran of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pacific. He also served as senior adviser to the Vice Chairman of the House Armed Service Committee (Rep. Jim Saxton) and the Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee (Rep.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo","Facebook disclosed the issue in a blog post on Friday, hours before media reports that conservative-leaning Cambridge Analytica, a data company known for its work on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was given access to the data and may not have deleted it.","The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which was already under attack over Russians’ alleged use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U.S. elections.","Facebook said the root of the problem was that researchers and Cambridge Analytica lied to it and abused its policies, but critics on Saturday threw blame at Facebook as well, demanding answers on behalf of users and calling for new regulation.","Facebook insisted the data was misused but not stolen, because users gave permission, sparking a debate about what constitutes a hack that must be disclosed to customers.","“The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley’s use of data.","Pasquale said Facebook’s response that data had not technically been stolen seemed to obfuscate the central issue that data was apparently used in a way contrary to the expectations of users.","“It amazes me that they are trying to make this about nomenclature. I guess that’s all they have left,” he said.","Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the “Wild West.”","“Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","With Republicans controlling the Senate’s majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail.","The New York Times and London’s Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted despite Facebook’s demands beginning in 2015.","Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015.

According to the Financial Times, reporters posed as prospective clients and secretly filmed a series of meetings, including one with the chief executive. The report is due to air this week.","Collins, the chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be recalling Nix to give further testimony to explain why he had told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook.","“We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments,” he said.","Collins will also call on Zuckerberg to testify. He said the company appeared to have previously sent executives who were able to avoid difficult questions and who “claimed not to know the answers”.","The two men may also face a summons from US lawmakers. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Cambridge Analytica to be “thoroughly investigated” and said Facebook must answer questions about how it came to provide private user information to an academic with links to Russia.","The Republican majority on the House intelligence committee announced this week they were winding up their investigation into Russia’s election interference, concluding there was no collusion with Trump’s campaign and, even more controversially, that Moscow did not seek to assist him. Schiff fiercely condemned that decision and said the Democratic minority would continue working on prescriptions for protecting the country in the future.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users, whether it acquired that information illegally and whether it sought to abuse that information in support of President Trump’s political campaign in the United States or Brexit in the United Kingdom,” he told the Guardian.","“The company has repeatedly touted its ability to influence voters through ‘psychographic’ targeting and has claimed it was the fundamental reason that Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Indeed, it may be that through Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign made use of illegitimately acquired data on millions of Americans in order to help sway the election.”","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2m, according to Federal Election Commission records. It denies using any Facebook data in the campaign.","Shortly before the story broke, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer that it was making “false and defamatory” allegations and reserved Facebook’s legal position. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by Cambridge Analytica, working with Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), was a data breach.","It also suspended the whistleblower Chris Wylie from the platform “pending further information” over misuse of data, along with his former employer Cambridge Analytica and its affiliates, and the academic they worked with, Kogan.","The public attack on Wylie came after he had approached the tech company about the data breach, offering to help investigate. He described it as a chilling attack on someone acting in the public interest.","“They acknowledged my offer but then turned around and shot the messenger. I’m trying to make amends for my mistakes and so should Facebook,” he told the Guardian. “Facebook has known about this for at least two years and did almost nothing to fix it. This is not new.

Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”","“We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,” Collins said. “Someone has to take responsibility for this.

Kogan had also passed information on to Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communications Laboratories, as well as Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who helped found Analytica.","Facebook learned of the violation in 2015 and \"demanded certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information has been destroyed.\" However, Facebook recently received reports that the information hadn't actually been deleted, leading to the account's suspension.","A Cambridge Analytica representative told CNN \"we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service,\" and stated the company had a signed statement confirming the data in question had been deleted.

Here's their conversation.","Patterson: Your office issued a statement (on March 20) that said, \"Consumers have a right to know their information is used, and companies like Facebook, have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users' personal information regarding Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\" The statement went on to say New Yorkers deserve answers, and if any company or individual violated the law, we will hold them accountable. So, let's start at the beginning here. Did Facebook and Cambridge Analytica violate the law?","Schneiderman: Well, we're conducting an investigation to determine what laws, if any, they violated and we're at the early stages of the investigation, but my counterpart in Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healy, and I have sent them a detailed letter demanding documents. They've already begun production. We also sent a document whole letter requiring preservation of files to Cambridge Analytica, so we'll see what laws were violated.","Different states have different data breach laws, different unfair and deceptive trade-practices laws. There is a law in New York against persistent illegal conduct and operating a business, so we're not sure what laws were violated, but we're going to conduct a very thorough investigation and find that out.","Patterson: Earlier this week, Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook issued a statement that enumerated a few bullets on how they will rectify the situation and how, in the future, they plan on protecting users' data. Did this statement go far enough?","Schneiderman: Well, it was a pretty general statement. I appreciate the fact that he took responsibility and has admitted they'd done something wrong, but I think at this point it's fair to say no one is just gonna take Facebook's word on this. They've lost a lot of public trust. And look, we've had good experiences. I have had good experiences working with Facebook in the past. We made a deal with them to take down all the pages that said, \"Gun for sale, no background check.\" We set up a system to get Amber alerts to Facebook users in a community where a child went missing, so our hope is that they'll want to work with us on developing solutions going forward but that's only going to happen if they're transparent, if we get all the documents we need and talk to all the witnesses we need to talk to to find out exactly what happened.","I mean, keep in mind, Facebook knew all of this customer data was compromised back in 2015, and they didn't do what they should've done then, so I think that they're going to have to do some work to credibly assert that now in 2018, all of a sudden, they're going to do everything right.","That having been said, we think, at the end of the day, the right solution is for us to determine what laws are violated, get the facts out to the public, and hopefully Facebook will then see it's in their interest to work with us on solutions going forward that state attorneys general, being the most important law enforcement officers, are going to be looking at this given the circumstances in Washington, are able to attest to the fact that they have, in fact, made these changes.","Patterson: That's so incredibly important. Often in the news cycle, we look at Washington and we think about national politics and our national representatives, but it's really the state's attorney general, in this case, that are enforcing some of the privacy regulations or at least the privacy concerns that consumers might have. What role do all state's attorney general, or at least in your case, have in protecting consumers?","Schneiderman: We have a tremendously important role and since this new administration came into power in January of 2017, the state's attorney general have been the leading edge of the legal resistance to bad public policies coming out of Washington. Congress, I don't think anyone should expect them to take meaningful action on this, if you look at what's happened over the last year or so. But we have beaten the federal government on all versions of the anti-Muslim travel ban, we've kept the DACA program going for the Dreamers through getting injunctions, both in New York and California, and on a host of environmental issues, health care issues, civil rights issues.","The genius of the United States is the founders left a lot of power at the state level because they were concerned about this new federal government they were creating maybe getting in the hands of the wrong people. This is something they talked about.","So it is true that a lot of folks that write about this particular people in the tech industry, you don't really focus that much on states, tend to think only of Washington. But I assure you, in this case, the most aggressive law enforcement is going to be coming from state AGs. We are hopeful that the Federal Trade Commission will also be looking at this. They said they will. Facebook entered into a consent decree with the FTC in 2011 that could have been, very well may have been violated in the Cambridge Analytica situation, so we welcome support from the federal government, but we're not going to wait for it. We're going to pursue this.","Patterson: Do you have all the tools you need, the legal tools you need, to properly pursue not just this case but similar cases?","Schneiderman: Yeah, we do. We can conduct full law enforcement investigations, civil or criminal, and we have a broad array of tools. We can subpoena documents, we can compel witnesses to testify, so our powers are similar to the powers of federal agencies, but I don't think you should look for Jeff Sessions in the US Justice Department to be aggressively be going after corporate malfeasance these days. So given that weakness in enforcement in federal laws and them essentially shutting down, work with the Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau), but they're not going to be aggressive protectors of consumers and that's where the states can fill in.","Patterson: Would you like to or would it be necessary at any point to speak to Mr. Zuckerberg?","Schneiderman: It may be. We're starting out by getting documents and we're also encouraging whistle-blowers to come forward, contact my office. We want to get to the facts. We want to get all the facts out, and we're interested in hearing what Facebook has to say. We're interested in talking to anyone else who's a witness who may have interesting information to convey to us. Again, I do think in the long run this may be a little bit challenging for them and in the long run it's in Facebook's interest to get the facts out there and regain the public trust and that's something that we hope they will see as we go forward.","Patterson: Are there lessons that other companies or other entities could learn from the way that Facebook and Cambridge Analytica handled data storage and disclosure to the public?","Schneiderman: Oh, sure. I think one of the shocking things about the facts of this report, and again, we're going to find out what the facts were, but one of the shocking things is really how inadequate Facebook's response was when in 2015 they learned that millions of Facebook users' data had been compromised and requiring not doing an audit, not checking what Cambridge Analytica was doing, they made it way to0 easy for them to get the data and then they made it way too easy for them to avoid any consequences. Asking them to certify that they destroyed the data, which Mr. Wiley, who's obviously an important witness here, said that just involved checking a box on his computer screen. That's not an adequate way to protect consumers.","So I think a lot of companies are gonna look at this and say, \"Okay, we have to get our act together. We can't allow data to be compromised.\" Facebook's argument so far has been somewhat technical. They're saying, \"Oh, well. It wasn't technically a breach. We don't like the use of the word breach because no one hacked into our system.\" Well, I don't think the public views it as much of a defense to say, \"No, they didn't hack into us. We just let them in and let them have all the data.\" And then when we discovered they had it we said, \"Will you promise us to destroy it?\" That's like, they didn't break into the warehouse where we were storing your stuff. We just left the door open and went shopping. That's not a very good defense.","Patterson: There is a regulation coming up very soon in Europe called the GDPR, that's the (General) Data Privacy Regulation, and that will change how companies manage and store data in the cloud and as almost every company is undergoing digital transformation or becoming more a cloud base, we'll see other instances of data protection and the lack of data protection. Is this a policy or regulation than would make sense in the United States as well?","Schneiderman: I think one of the things that has become apparent already to those of us who are focused on it, but will become even more clear in the months ahead, is the incredible gap between law enforcement and data protection, privacy protection in Europe and in the United States. We are just way behind. And again, I think it's in the interest of Facebook and others in the industry to really try and ensure that we steer towards smart, effective regulation. The notion that there will be no further regulation is misguided, they may put it off for a little while but the public's just going to demand it.","As you can see, this data breach has gotten a different response from the public. This is something that I think reflects a significant change in public awareness and the determination to ensure that something better is done, is very strong. Again, I appreciate Mr. Zuckerberg's statement that he took responsibility. We're looking forward to them working with us and others to ensure that they actually do take the steps necessary to regain the trust of their consumers.","Patterson: It is reassuring to learn that they have worked with your office in the past, but also in the past Facebook has had privacy challenges that have been controversial and when the controversy dies down they kind of go back to the old way of doing business or at least an incremental version of the old way of doing business.","If this blows over as well, at least in terms of public outcry, what are the consequences if Facebook doesn't do what they said they would do?","Schneiderman: Oh, I would be very surprised if this blows over. I think that, if anything, I think you're going to have more questions being raised. I mean, keep in mind, it was so easy for Cambridge Anaylytica to get access to the private information of millions of Facebook users. That raises the question, who else got access? Since the door was virtually wide open, this raises more question and some of the statements they've made in the last week or so, have raised more questions than they've answered, so I don't think this is going to go away and I think there will be ... they're going to have to address this in a more comprehensive way.","But our goal, first and foremost is to protect New Yorkers and others who may have had their private information compromised improperly, and find out what representations are made, what their policies were, what their interaction and what their contracts were with Aleksandr Kogan, who was the academic who worked with Cambridge Analytica and the facilitator of them getting the data. We've got to examine all the facts and our first and foremost goal is to protect consumers and, in addition to Attorney General Healy and myself, there are other states that have sent letters or subpoenas to Facebook, and I think there will be a strong law-enforcement effort here and Facebook should work with us, rather than against us. We're looking forward to getting out the facts and I think they should be also.","Patterson: Mr. Attorney General, thank you for your time today. One last question. America has been divided for almost ten years on this. Are you an Android person or an iPhone person?","Schneiderman: This is one of the big fissures. I am an iPhone person.","Keep up with other important security issues by subscribing to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter."],"isopubdate":""}

It had suspended Strategic Communication Laboratories and Cambridge Analytica, its data lab, for illegitimately obtaining user data and holding on to it when instructed otherwise. Cambridge Analytica, depending on whom you ask, was either just one of many players in the 2016 election or one of few key players who landed Trump’s victory. The data-accessing — back in 2015, Facebook had no rules to keep third-party apps from accessing your friends’ data when you gave said app access to your data — should concern you if you fall into either camp, though the “Cambridge Analytica scores landmark victory for Trump” camp might want to be more concerned. This was all on Friday night.","By Monday, the plot had only thickened. Over the weekend, Cambridge Analytica co-founder Christopher Wylie tweeted that his Facebook account had been suspended. Wylie is the whistle-blower whose revelations to major news outlets prompted Facebook’s late-night press release in the first place.","Meanwhile, Facebook announced that it will conduct its own audit of C.A. “We have hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica,” the company said in a statement on its blog on Monday. “Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford the firm complete access to their servers and systems.” Facebook will be trying to figure out if user data that Cambridge Analytica claimed it destroyed was actually, in fact, destroyed. Aleksandr Kogan, a University of Cambridge professor whom C.A. brought in to build a psychometric profile database via an app-based survey, has also agreed to the audit. Facebook says that Christopher Wylie has, thus far, declined."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

He hired a pollster, visited a Detroit auto plant and other swing-state locations, and gave a high-profile commencement speech.","Meanwhile, Facebook has been under intense criticism for its role as a vector of misinformation in recent elections. This week, Facebook admitted that Russian accounts purchased $100,000 in political ads in 2015 and 2016. This disclosure comes only two months after the platform refused to disclose who is paying for advertising on the platform and where they’re running.","This confluence of events demonstrates the urgent need for greater transparency about how Facebook is already being used for electoral influence, particularly its algorithms and advertising features. Facebook must be regulated like the broadcast medium that it has become. And if Zuckerberg wants to run for office, he should be leading the charge for meaningful transparency.","The Facebook platform already has the ability to shift the outcome election if it so chooses. Setting aside the issue of so-called ‘fake news’ and its spread on the platform during 2016, Facebook itself is a powerful tool of voter mobilization and information.","My own research demonstrates that seeing one’s Facebook friends praise others for voting increases turnout; other work finds that exposure to voting-related posts on Facebook increases turnout.","Meanwhile, Facebook’s internal research shows that exposing users to voting reminders that include pictures or names of friends also makes them more likely to vote. Algorithmic shifts that prioritize showing these kinds of messages to certain groups of voters and suppressing them from others could theoretically be used to help a particular candidate.","Currently, however, candidates can’t manipulate the algorithm – they only have access to Facebook’s public organizing and advertising tools. They can create fan pages, pay to promote posts, use Facebook ads to recruit fans, recruit members for their email lists, and deploy apps that supporters can use to engage their friends.","And while shifts in Facebook’s algorithms can hurt the organic reach of posts by candidate pages, theoretically these changes are deployed without the intent to harm or benefit specific campaigns.","The algorithm makes Facebook different from other media – we don’t see a customized TV feed or hear different radio songs based on what we’ve liked before. This algorithm has long been a black box for people outside of the company. Now, it’s time for the platform to explain how it influences what political content gets spread on the network.","Advertising is another area where Facebook needs to radically increase transparency. While candidates must disclose their spending on required campaign finance filings, they can avoid reporting their exact Facebook spending amounts by hiring a firm to run the ads and paying for them as part of their overall consulting fee.","Other entities don’t have to disclose their Facebook spending at all, such as business entities, social welfare organizations, or so-called “dark money” groups. Furthermore, there’s nothing to stop the administrator of a Facebook page from paying to promote misleading or false content into millions of newsfeeds – and it’s not clear that they would have to disclose it to anyone.","That’s why Facebook needs to pro-actively disclose the political advertisements made on its platform: the amount, spender, content, and targeting. There is precedent for this kind of disclosure: TV and radio stations have been providing so-called public inspection files.","This reform would also result in the disclosure of spending by any autocratic states or regimes in weak democracies that want to promote propaganda on Facebook. Facebook should also block the use of their paid features to promote links to websites and pages that knowingly publish political misinformation.","That would limit the spread of fake news on the platform going forward. And while Facebook claims to have blocked ads from running on fake news sites, they have not yet taken the step to block ads on Facebook by fake news sites – or haven’t disclosed it, if they have.","Disclosure of the algorithm and ad spending are big steps – and would generate an equally large increase in transparency regarding Facebook’s role and use in spreading political content. While these disclosures would not necessarily stop outside interference or bad actors, at the very least voters would have the chance to know how the platform was being used to influence them.","Facebook’s report on “information operations” in the 2016 election was a good first step in identifying organized efforts to use Facebook to influence political opinion. However, their analysis is primarily focused on fake accounts and coordinated efforts to boost the organic spread of misinformation. Facebook’s paid features and algorithm are arguably much more powerful.","With two billion global users, Facebook has been adopted faster than any technology or service in human history, and due to its widespread use, people deserve more information regarding its influence in elections. We need to know who is paying to put political content in our newsfeeds, and how the Facebook platform itself determines who sees what.","It’s in the best interests of democratic society to do so. And if this appeal to virtue isn’t convincing enough, Zuckerberg should do so out of self-interest. All of these concerns will reach a fever pitch if Facebook’s CEO runs for office, given the unique ability of the platform to mobilize voters for the boss. Rather than wait for the next crisis, Facebook needs to increase its transparency now.","Katherine Haenschen is Assistant Professor, Department of Communication at Virginia Tech University"],"isopubdate":"2017-09-09"}

In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.”","Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.”","Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information.","Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica either played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential election or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to help disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","…We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","“There’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.”","Responding to the allegations, Cambridge Analytica sent the following statement.","In 2014, SCL Elections contracted Dr. Kogan via his company Global Science Research (GSR) to undertake a large scale research project in the US. GSR was contractually committed to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR were also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. The language in the SCL Elections contract with GSR is explicit on these points. GSR subsequently obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, SCL Elections deleted all data it had received from GSR. For the avoidance of doubt, no data from GSR was used in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election.","Under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act (Unlawful obtaining etc. of personal data), a criminal offense has not been committed if a person has acted in the reasonable belief that he had in law the right to obtain data. GSR was a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding the its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections. It would be entirely incorrect to attempt to claim that SCL Elections","illegally acquired Facebook data. Indeed SCL Elections worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that SCL Elections had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s Terms of Service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-16"}

So, in June 2011, when Google launched Google Plus, Zuckerberg put his company into lockdown. In an adaption from his new book on Silicon Valley, former Facebook employee Antonio García Martínez describes the war that followed.","Not in the Asperger’s, autistic way depicted in the very fictional movie The Social Network, the cognitive genius of exceptional ability. That’s a modern definition that reduces the original meaning.","Nor would I say he was the Steve Jobsian product genius, either. Anyone claiming as much will have to explain the crowded graveyard of forgotten Facebook product failures. Remember “Home,” the Facebook-enabled home screen for Android phones, launched with much fanfare at a Facebook press event in 2013, Zuck appearing alongside the C.E.O. of the soon-to-be-disappointed smartphone-maker HTC? Or Facebook’s misguided bet on HTML5 in 2012, which slowed the mobile app to a frustrating crawl? How about Facebook’s first version of Search, available in English only, mostly useful for checking out your friends’ single female friends, and since discontinued? The stand-alone mobile app Paper, which was a shameless rip-off of Flipboard? Some unlaunched products I can’t name consumed massive resources, dying internally after Zuck changed his mind and shut them down.","If he’s a product genius, then there’s lots of serendipity counterbalancing his divine madness.","No. I submit he is an old-school genius, the fiery force of nature possessed by a tutelary spirit of seemingly supernatural provenance that fuels and guides him, intoxicates his circle, and compels his retinue to be great as well. The Jefferson, the Napoléon, the Alexander... the Jim Jones, the L. Ron Hubbard, the Joseph Smith. Keeper of a messianic vision that, though mercurial and stinting on specifics, presents an overwhelming and all-consuming picture of a new and different world. Have a mad vision and you’re a kook. Get a crowd to believe in it as well and you’re a leader. By imprinting this vision on his disciples, Zuckerberg founded the church of a new religion. All the early Facebook employees have their story of the moment when they saw the light and realized that Facebook wasn’t some measly social network like MySpace but a dream of a different human experience. With all the fervor of recent converts, newly recruited followers attracted other committed, smart, and daring engineers and designers, themselves seduced by the echoes of the Zuckian vision in others.","Down in the Valley","Then there was the culture he created.","Many cool Valley companies have engineering-first cultures, but Facebook took it to a different level. The engineers ran the place, and so as long as you shipped code and didn’t break anything (too often), you were golden. The spirit of subversive hackery guided everything. In the early days, a Georgia college kid named Chris Putnam created a virus that made your Facebook profile resemble MySpace, then the social-media incumbent. It went rampant and started deleting user data as well. Instead of siccing the F.B.I. dogs on Putnam, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz invited him for an interview and offered him a job. He went on to become one of Facebook’s more famous and rage-filled engineers. That was the uniquely piratical attitude: if you could get shit done and quickly, nobody cared much about credentials or traditional legalistic morality. The hacker ethos prevailed above all.","This culture is what kept 23-year-old kids who were making half a million a year, in a city where there was lots of fun on offer if you had the cash, tethered to a corporate campus for 14-hour days. They ate three meals a day there, sometimes slept there, and did nothing but write code, review code, or comment on new features in internal Facebook groups. On the day of the I.P.O.—Facebook’s victory rally—the Ads area was full of busily working engineers at eight P.M. on a Friday. All were at that point worth real money—even fuck-you money for some—and all were writing code on the very day their paper turned to hard cash.","At Facebook, your start date was celebrated by the company the way evangelicals celebrate the day they were baptized and found Jesus, or the way new American citizens celebrate the day they took their oath in front of the flag. This event was called (really) your Faceversary, and every colleague would rush to congratulate you on Facebook (of course), just as normal people did for one another on their birthdays. Often the company or your colleagues would order you a garish surprise bouquet for your desk, with one of those huge Mylar balloons in the shape of a 2 or whatever. When someone left Facebook (usually around when the balloons said 4 or 5), everyone would treat it as a death, as if you were leaving the current plane of existence and going to another one (though it wasn’t assumed this next plane would be better than the current one). The tombstone of your Facebook death was a photo posted on Facebook of your weathered and worn corporate ID. It was customary to include a weepy suicide note/self-written epitaph, and the post would garner hundreds of likes and comments inside a minute.","To the deceased, it felt like a passing, too. When you left Facebook, you left the employee-only Facebook network, which meant that all the posts from internal groups (with secret company stuff) were gone, your posts got less distribution among other Facebook employees (who were on it 24/7, of course), and your Facebook feed, which had become your only social view of the world, suddenly slowed to a near-empty crawl. Almost instantly, someone would add you to the ex-Facebook secret groups, which served as a sort of post-employment purgatory where former employees discussed the company.","Pause and consider all this for a lingering moment: the militant engineering culture, the all-consuming work identity, the apostolic sense of devotion to a great cause. The cynics will read statements from Zuckerberg or some other senior exec about creating “a more open and connected world” and think, “Oh, what sentimental drivel.” The critics will read of a new product tweak or partnership and think Facebook is doing it only to make more money.","They’re wrong.","Facebook is full of true believers who really, really, really are not doing it for the money, and really, really will not stop until every man, woman, and child on earth is staring into a blue-bannered window with a Facebook logo. Which, if you think about it, is much scarier than simple greed. The greedy man can always be bought at some price, and his behavior is predictable. But the true zealot? He can’t be had at any price, and there’s no telling what his mad visions will have him and his followers do.","That’s what we’re talking about with Mark Elliot Zuckerberg and the company he created.","In June 2011, Google launched an obvious Facebook copy called Google Plus. Obnoxiously wired in to other Google products like Gmail and YouTube, it was meant to join all users of Google services into one online identity, much as Facebook did for the Internet as a whole. Given you had a Google Plus sign-up button practically everywhere in your Google user experience, the possibility of its network growing exponentially was very real indeed. Also, the product itself was pretty good, in some ways better than Facebook. The photo sharing was better and more geared to serious photographers, and much of the design cleaner and more minimalist. An additional plus for Google Plus: it had no ads, as Google could subsidize it with AdWords, its paid-search gold mine. This was the classic one-hand-washing-the-other tactic of the ruthless monopolist, like Microsoft using the revenue from Windows to crush Netscape Navigator with Explorer back in the 90s. By owning search, Google would bankroll taking over social media as well.","This sudden move was somewhat surprising. For years Google had been famously dismissive of Facebook, the rarefied heights of its search monopoly making it feel untouchable. But as the one-way parade of expensive talent from Google to Facebook continued with no end in sight, Google got nervous. Companies are like countries: the populations really vote only with their feet, either coming or going. Google instituted a policy whereby any desirable Googler who got a Facebook offer would have it beaten instantly by a heaping Google counter-offer. This, of course, caused a rush of Googlers to interview at Facebook, only to use the resulting offer as a bargaining chip to improve their Google pay. But many were legitimately leaving. The Googlers at Facebook were a bit like the Greeks during the rise of the Roman Empire: they brought lots of civilization and tech culture with them, but it was clear who was going to run the world in the near future.","Google Plus was Google finally taking note of Facebook and confronting the company head-on, rather than via cloak-and-dagger recruitment shenanigans and catty disses at tech conferences. It hit Facebook like a bomb. Zuck took it as an existential threat comparable to the Soviets’ placing nukes in Cuba in 1962. Google Plus was the great enemy’s sally into our own hemisphere, and it gripped Zuck like nothing else. He declared “Lockdown,” the first and only one during my time there. As was duly explained to the more recent employees, Lockdown was a state of war that dated to Facebook’s earliest days, when no one could leave the building while the company confronted some threat, either competitive or technical.","How, might you ask, was Lockdown officially announced? We received an e-mail at 1:45 P.M. the day Google Plus launched, instructing us to gather around the Aquarium, the glass-walled cube that was Zuck’s throne room. Actually, it technically instructed us to gather around the Lockdown sign. This was a neon sign bolted to the upper reaches of the Aquarium, above the cube of glass, almost like the NO VACANCY sign on a highway motel. By the time the company had gathered itself around, that sign was illuminated, tipping us off to what was coming.","Zuckerberg was usually a poor speaker. His speech came at the rapid clip of someone accustomed to analyzing language for content only, and at the speed of a very agile mind that didn’t have time for rhetorical flourishes. It was geek-speak, basically, the English language as spoken by people who have four screens of computer code open at once. His bearing was aloof and disconnected from his audience, and yet he maintained that intense stare that bordered on the psychopathic. It was an unnerving look that had irrevocably rattled more than one interlocutor, typically some poor employee undergoing a withering\nproduct review, and it stared out from every Fortune or Time cover he graced. It was easy to project a creepy persona onto that gaze. That unfortunate first impression, plus the mischaracterization in the film The Social Network, was probably responsible for half of the ever present suspicion and paranoia surrounding Facebook’s motives. But occasionally Zuck would have a charismatic moment of lucid greatness, and it would be stunning.","From top, the LOCKDOWN sign; a Facebook workspace.","From top, by Jason Kincaid, Kim Kulish/Corbis/Getty Images.","The 2011 Lockdown speech didn’t promise to be one of those moments. It was delivered completely impromptu from the open space next to the stretch of desks where the executive staff sat. All of Facebook’s engineers, designers, and product managers gathered around him in a rapt throng; the scene brought to mind a general addressing his troops in the field.","The contest for users, he told us, would now be direct and zero-sum. Google had launched a competing product; whatever was gained by one side would be lost by the other. It was up to all of us to up our game while the world conducted live tests of Facebook versus Google’s version of Facebook and decided which it liked more. He hinted vaguely at product changes we would consider in light of this new competitor. The real point, however, was to have everyone aspire to a higher bar of reliability, user experience, and site performance.","In a company whose overarching mantras were DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT and PERFECT IS THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD, this represented a course correction, a shift to the concern for quality that typically lost out to the drive to ship. It was the sort of nagging paternal reminder to keep your room clean that Zuck occasionally dished out after Facebook had suffered some embarrassing bug or outage.","Rounding off another beaded string of platitudes, he changed gears and erupted with a burst of rhetoric referencing one of the ancient classics he had studied at Harvard and before. “You know, one of my favorite Roman orators ended every speech with the phrase Carthago delenda est. ‘Carthage must be destroyed.’ For some reason I think of that now.” He paused as a wave of laughter tore through the crowd.","The aforementioned orator was Cato the Elder, a noted Roman senator and inveigher against the Carthaginians, who clamored for the destruction of Rome’s great challenger in what became the Third Punic War. Reputedly, he ended every speech with that phrase, no matter the topic.","Carthago delenda est. Carthage must be destroyed!","Zuckerberg’s tone went from paternal lecture to martial exhortation, the drama mounting with every mention of the threat Google represented. The speech ended to a roar of cheering and applause. Everyone walked out of there ready to invade Poland if need be. It was a rousing performance. Carthage must be destroyed!","In the Trenches","The Facebook Analog Research Laboratory jumped into action and produced a poster with CARTHAGO DELENDA EST splashed in imperative bold type beneath a stylized Roman centurion’s helmet. This improvised printshop made all manner of posters and ephemera, often distributed semi-furtively at nights and on weekends, in a fashion reminiscent of Soviet samizdat. The art itself was always exceptional, evoking both the mechanical typography of W.W. II-era propaganda posters and contemporary Internet design, complete with faux vintage logos. This was Facebook’s ministry of propaganda, and it was originally started with no official permission or budget, in an unused warehouse space. In many ways, it was the finest exemplar of Facebook values: irreverent yet bracing in its martial qualities.","The Carthago posters went up immediately all over the campus and were stolen almost as fast. It was announced that the cafés would be open over the weekends, and a proposal was seriously floated to have the shuttles from Palo Alto and San Francisco run on the weekends, too. This would make Facebook a fully seven-days-a-week company; by whatever means, employees were expected to be in and on duty. In what was perceived as a kindly concession to the few employees with families, it was also announced that families were welcome to visit on weekends and eat in the cafés, allowing the children to at least see Daddy (and, yes, it was mostly Daddy) on weekend afternoons. My girlfriend and our one-year-old daughter, Zoë, came by, and we weren’t the only family there, by any stretch. Common was the scene of the swamped Facebook employee with logo’d hoodie spending an hour of quality time with his wife and two kids before going back to his desk.","And what was everyone working on?","For those in the user-facing side of Facebook, it meant thinking twice on a code change amid the constant, hell-for-leather dash to ship some new product bell or whistle, so we wouldn’t look like the half-assed, thrown-together, social-media Frankenstein we occasionally were.","For us in the Ads team, it was mostly corporate solidarity that made us join the weekend-working mob. At Facebook, even then and certainly later, you got along by going along, and everyone sacrificing his or her entire life for the cause was as much about self-sacrifice and team building as it was an actual measure of your productivity. This was a user battle, not a revenue one, and there was little we could do to help wage the Google Plus Punic War, other than not totally horrifying users with some aggressive new Ads product—something nobody had the nerve to do in those pre-I.P.O. days.","Internal Facebook groups sprang up to dissect every element of the Google Plus product. On the day Plus launched, I noted an Ads product manager named Paul Adams in close conversation with Zuckerberg and a couple members of the high command inside a small conference room. As was well known, before he defected to Facebook, Paul had been one of the product designers for Google Plus. Now that the product had launched, presumably he was no longer restrained by a non-disclosure agreement with Google, and Facebook was having him walk the leadership through the public aspects of Google Plus.","Facebook was not fucking around. This was total war.","I decided to do some reconnaissance. En route to work one Sunday morning, I skipped the Palo Alto exit on the 101 and got off in Mountain View instead. Down Shoreline I went and into the sprawling Google campus. The multicolored Google logo was everywhere, and clunky Google-colored bikes littered the courtyards. I had visited friends here before and knew where to find the engineering buildings. I made my way there and contemplated the parking lot.","It was empty. Completely empty.","Interesting.","I got back on the 101 North and drove to Facebook.","At the California Avenue building, I had to hunt for a parking spot. The\nlot was full.","It was clear which company was fighting to the death.","Carthage must be destroyed!","Left, a Facebook mantra abandoned in light of the challenge from Google; Right, employees at work.","While Zuck wouldn’t burn Google to the ground, take the wives and children of Google employees as slaves, and salt the grounds of the former Google offices so nothing would grow there for generations, as some say Rome did to Carthage, it was still about as ignominious a defeat as one got in the tech world.","Not that this was clear from the first skirmishes, mind you.","In fact, the initial signs were more than alarming. Google Plus wasn’t some halfhearted effort by Google to knock off a pesky upstart. The news coming out of Google, leaked via the press, or via current Google employees (former colleagues to many Facebookers, who’d come from their current mortal rival), was that all of Google’s internal product teams were being re-oriented in favor of Google Plus. Even Search, then and now the most frequented destination on the Web, was being dragged into the fray and would supposedly sport social features. Search results would now vary based on your connections via Google Plus, and anything you shared—photos, posts, even chats with friends—would now be used as part of Google’s ever powerful and mysterious search algorithm.","This was shocking news, even more so to Googlers. Search was the company’s tabernacular product, the holy of holies, the on-line oracle of human knowledge that had replaced libraries and encyclopedias.","By all accounts (and Google information security was clearly not as good as Facebook’s), this caused a considerable stir internally. In January 2012, Google co-founder Larry Page, at the companywide Q&A session known as “TGIF,” addressed this new direction forcefully, quelling the internal dissent and reportedly vowing: “This is the path we’re headed down—a single, unified, ‘beautiful’ product across everything. If you don’t get that, then you should probably work somewhere else.”","Gauntlet thrown down, Google products were soon ranked via one unique metric—how much did they contribute to Google’s social vision?—and were either consolidated or discarded appropriately.","Ne Plus Ultra?","As part of the budding media seduction around this new product, Google posted eye-popping usage numbers. In September 2012, it announced that the service had 400 million registered users and 100 million active ones. Facebook hadn’t even quite reached a billion users yet, and it had taken the company four years to reach the milestone—100 million users—that Google had reached in one. This caused something close to panic inside Facebook, but as we’d soon learn, the reality on the battlefield was somewhat different than what Google was letting on.","This contest had so rattled the search giant, intoxicated as they were with unfamiliar existential anxiety about the threat that Facebook posed, that they abandoned their usual sober objectivity around engineering staples like data and began faking their usage numbers to impress the outside world, and (no doubt) intimidate Facebook.","This was the classic new-product sham, the “Fake it till you make it” of the unscrupulous startupista, meant to flatter the ego and augment chances of future (real) success by projecting an image of current (imagined) success.","The numbers were originally taken seriously—after all, it wasn’t absurd to think Google could drive usage quickly—but after a while even the paranoid likes of Facebook insiders (not to mention the outside world) realized Google was juicing the numbers, the way an Enron accountant would a revenue report. Usage is always somewhat in the eye of the beholder, and Google was considering anyone who had ever so much as clicked on a Google Plus button anywhere as part of their usual Google experience a “user.” Given the overnight proliferation of Google Plus buttons all over Google, like mushrooms on a shady knoll, one could claim “usage” when a Google user so much as checked e-mail or uploaded a private photo. The reality was Google Plus users were rarely posting or engaging with posted content, and they certainly weren’t returning repeatedly like the proverbial lab rat in the drug experiment hitting the lever for another drop of cocaine water (as they did on Facebook). When self-delusion and self-flattery enter the mind-set of a product team, and the metrics they judge themselves by, like the first plague rat coming onto a ship, the end is practically preordained.","The face of Google Plus could not have been more perfect: Vic Gundotra was a former Microsoft exec who’d climbed the treacherous corporate ladder there before jumping to Google. It was he who had whispered a litany of fear into the ear of Google co-founder Larry Page, who had green-lit the project, and it was he who headed the rushed and top-down effort (unusual for Google) to ship a product within an ambitious 100 days.","A certain resinous smarminess coated Gundotra, like a thin layer of annoying motor oil on a socket wrench, never letting you get a real grip on it. And toolish he was, stumping loudly for Google Plus in countless media interviews and at Google-sponsored events. What was most insulting to a Facebooker was his studiously avoiding mentioning the social-media behemoth in public statements, as if the very raison d’être for his now towering presence at Google didn’t even exist. Like some Orwellian copywriter, engineering language and perception to suit a fictional reality, Google would rarely mention the Facebook elephant in the room in any public statement, insulting any viewer by suggesting they had practically invented the notion of Internet-mediated social interaction. “Networks are for networking,” intoned Gundotra, any reference to Facebook always oblique and dismissive. “Circles are for the right people,” he continued, referring to Google Circles, a way of organizing social contacts, shamelessly copied from Facebook’s long-ignored Lists\nfeature.","Vic’s mere visage had an almost Emmanuel Goldstein-esque quality, and many were the rips and the gibes that he suffered in internal groups, a socially mediated Two-Minute Hate, whenever someone posted a link to some pro-Google bloviation of his. This had gone beyond mere corporate rivalry to become a personal struggle to Facebookers, many of whom saw their identities wrapped up in the company, Facebook as an expression of themselves (or was it vice versa?).","In April of 2014, after the Google-Facebook war had mostly run its course, Vic suddenly announced he was leaving Google. There was a “Ding Dong the Witch is Dead” note of triumph inside Facebook, as everyone breathed a sigh of relief at the passing threat.","Like a general’s fall marking the rout of his army, Vic’s departure was as clear a sign as any that Google had given up on social, sucking up a defeat at the hands of a company it had previously ignored, if not held in outright contempt. This was only confirmed when it was simultaneously revealed that many Google Plus product teams, such as the chat app Hangouts and the photo-sharing app Photos, would be rolled into the Android team, the mobile operating system Google owned. Google spun it as Google Plus becoming not a “product” but a “platform,” a sort of general-use tool that would enhance the user experience across Google’s wide array of products.","It was like a government announcing their army was not in retreat but rather advancing in reverse, and everyone at Facebook saw through the face-saving P.R. wordplay. Google Plus was over; Facebook had won. The Lockdown circling of the wagons had triumphed.","Left, a poster with a charge from Zuckerberg targeting Google (a quotation from Cato the Elder that translates as “Carthage must be destroyed”); Right, an exhortation to all.","The long-term conclusion was this: Facebook lived inside an unassailable redoubt of its own social network, a fortress that was completely impregnable, at least to conventional assaults via lots of money and smart people, as Google had attempted. Once everyone and his mother was on Facebook, they weren’t leaving it, even when the Internet’s most used site (i.e., Google Search itself) was used as inducement to join.","While Facebook clearly outpaced Google in focus and esprit de corps, the plucky upstart against the complacent incumbent, there was still the issue of revenue. Google’s was still more than five times Facebook’s, and the social-media giant, for however many hours of user time it managed to ingest via its blue-bannered maw, still wasn’t monetizing users very well. If Facebook was ever to really hold its own against Google (not to mention revenue geysers like Apple and Amazon), it would need its own revenue geyser, like Google’s AdWords or Apple’s iPhone. In pursuit of that, Facebook would embark on an ambitious and ill-conceived company-spanning project of its own. Like Google Plus, that product would consume the company entirely, only to end in the smoldering ruin of abject failure. But from those ashes, plus the anxiety of a looming I.P.O., Facebook would finally find its own gold mine: monetizing mobile usage."],"isopubdate":"2016-06-03"}

Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","News reports now suggest that contrary to prior representations, Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Jared Kushner to run Trump’s data operation, had contacts with Russians, specifically a Russian energy firm. (“Energy firm Lukoil, which is now on the US sanctions list and has been used as a vehicle of government influence, saw a presentation on the firm’s work in 2014. It began with a focus on voter suppression in Nigeria, and Cambridge Analytica also discussed ‘micro-targeting’ individuals on social media during elections.”)","Cambridge Analytica was also the subject of a Wall Street Journal report, which found that “the chief executive of a data-analytics firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s campaign reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to offer help organizing the Hillary Clinton-related emails the website was releasing, according to a person familiar with the effort. The outreach by the CEO of the firm, which is partly owned by a major Trump donor and has close ties to a Trump adviser, came as Mr. Trump was publicly cheering the leaks of his Democratic rival’s emails and some supporters were seeking to unearth further messages.” And one more nugget: None other than Michael Flynn had an “advisory role” with a firm linked to Cambridge Analytica.","Maybe this is all coincidence. Perhaps Cambridge Analytica has no role whatsoever in providing guidance or data to Russians seeking to manipulate the U.S. election. Perhaps Facebook was an entirely innocent player, hoodwinked by Cambridge Analytica (which was recently suspended from the platform), and had no idea that all this data was being sourced to aid in foreign manipulation of our election. However, at this point, Congress and the American people have considerable reason to doubt those conclusions.","Congress needs to get executives from Facebook (Zuckerberg himself) and Cambridge Analytica up to the Hill promptly to get answers from both firms. The public needs to know:","What was the extent of contacts between Cambridge Analytica and Russian officials?","Did Cambridge Analytica help guide the Russian social media operation by, for example, targeting specific users?","What information did Kushner have, if any, about Cambridge Analytica’s operation and its use of Facebook data?","What did Facebook know about Cambridge Analytica’s operation, when did it know it, and has it been candid and forthcoming in its disclosures?","Answers to these questions are critical not only to the Russia investigation but also to the future of social media platforms. The stakes are obviously high for Facebook, especially if it (intentionally or not) provided more of a boost to Trump’s victory than previously acknowledged. As intelligence analyst Malcolm Nance put it, “What happens if 100s of millions of progressives worldwide abandon Facebook because they think it’s a tool of Trump, Russia authoritarians and neo-Nazis? Facebook needs to own up and do damage control to ensure they are not 2018’s information cruise missile of choice.” Even if it never intended to bolster Trump, it’s hard to disagree that it was lax in recognizing manipulation of its platform and in disclosing the extent of the misuse of users’ data. “What’s clear is that Facebook has built up a massive intelligence tool that can be exploited by foreign actors who don’t care at all if they are violating Facebook’s user agreements,” remarks Max Bergmann, who heads the Moscow Project at the Center for American Progress. “This incident demonstrates that it is time for Washington to get serious about regulating the tech companies. They’ve been living in a libertarian fantasy world of ‘don’t be evil’ but that doesn’t work when you have a fiduciary responsibility to your shareholders to prioritize profits.”","Facebook’s conduct during and after the 2016 election may well lead to federal regulation of social media of the type Klobuchar, Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) are sponsoring, which would require archiving of political ads with detailed information regarding “a description of the audience the advertisement targets, the number of views generated, the dates and times of publication, the rates charged, and the contact information of the purchaser” and also subject online ads to the same campaign regulations that govern TV and radio ads.","At this point, it is increasingly hard to argue against such regulation, given the cavalier conduct of Facebook and the obvious opportunities for abuse by malicious foreign governments.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,\" the ads stated.","Cambridge Analytica got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million.","The Trump campaign paid the firm $6 million during the 2016 election, although it has since distanced itself from Cambridge."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}
{"originalurl":"https://www.phonearena.com/news/Facebook-settings-hide-dont-give-away-private-data-location-pictures_id103429","title":"Want to use Facebook more securely? Just follow these steps to stop unwanted data leaks","text":["How to use Facebook without giving away all of your data","OK, so the recent Cambridge Analytica – Facebook scandal has ruffled the Internet's collective feathers. Once again, we are reminded that we live in an era where it's a bit too easy to overshare. If you are still fuzzy on what all the data has been used for — political consultants use the information gathered to target different types of people with different types of ads. Based on the data, the politician is advised on where they should hold a speech, what to say, how to “brand” themselves.","Attempts to manipulate the masses are nothing new and certainly not exclusive to the post-Facebook era. But it's a good idea to try and not make it too easy. After all, does the Facebook app really need all the permissions we are giving it? Do we really need to tag every activity and every location we visit? Nope.","So, if you have decided to keep using Facebook, but would like to be a bit more mindful with what you divulge, we've compiled a bunch of tips for you to keep you from over-sharing. Let's take a look at what we can do in terms of app permissions and settings:","Contents:","iPhone Permission Settings","On your iPhone, open the Settings app and scroll down until you find Facebook. If you have ever given Facebook the permission to look for your Location, use your Camera, or Microphone — this is where you can disable those permissions. If you want to tag yourself for being at a bar — you can do so manually, by looking for the place within the app. If you want to upload or send a photo — take it with your dedicated Camera app, then send it within the Facebook app. Easy as that, no need to grant those permissions if you are feeling paranoid about them.","Settings → Facebook","If you have Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram installed, you can do the same for them. Same rules apply.","Android Permission Settings","Go into Settings → Apps → Facebook → Permissions. You can disable Location here. Now, a lot of speculation is going around that Facebook may or may not be using your phone's microphone to listen for keywords that may help with ad targeting. We won't go as far as to comment whether these are true or false, but if you are worried about this, go ahead and disable access to Microphone and Camera. From here on out, whenever you want to share a clip or photo, don't take it with the Facebook app. Instead, go into your Camera, take your photo, go back to Facebook and share them manually.","Settings → Apps → Facebook","If you have Messenger installed, and you most probably do — do the same with its permissions. Same goes for Instagram and WhatsApp. You can easily share videos and pictures that you've already taken with your Camera through those apps — no reason to give them access to your phone's resources.","Facebook Privacy Settings","Facebook Settings as they appear on iPhone and Android","Facebook Settings as they appear on iPhone and Android","Now, open up the Facebook app and access the sandwich menu, which is the rightmost tab. Scroll down to Account Settings → Privacy. In “Manage Your Profile”, you will be able to manage your profile data — the city you live in, where you went to school, your workplace, phone number, family and relatives. You know, if you delete these now, there's no guarantee they will actually be wiped from the Internet forever. But at least take a mental note of what you've shared and what you'd like to not share in the future.","Back in Privacy, the “Limit who can see past posts” option is also a great “nuke it all” option if you suddenly feel remorseful about sharing too many posts with a setting of Public or Friends of Friends. Basically, it will instantly switch all your posts that you've ever made to the “Friends” setting. This means that anyone who is marked as “acquaintance” or anyone who is not your friend at all will not be able to see them, unless they are tagged in them.","Go back to the Account Settings sub-menu and enter Location for a brief moment. Since we removed the Location permission from the phone's settings, you will be warned that the toggles in this menu won't work unless you grant that permission back. That's OK, we're not here to do that. Get rid of the prompt and turn off “Location History”.","Clear that location history","Now, let's get to the interesting bit. Go back to Account Settings and down to the Apps sub-menu. Here's a breakdown of what you can do in each tab:","1. Logged in with Facebook — this will give you a list of all the apps, polls, games, and services you've ever synced to your Facebook. Guess what, even if you uninstall the app, the service itself still has permission to access your profile. So, scan through them carefully and delete any one you no longer use.","2. Platform — this is the “nuke it all” option for the above tab. If you want to stop the Facebook platform from interacting with any website, any app, and any service you ever visit, enable this. This means that, from now on, you will have to use alternative methods to log in other apps, if such are available.","3. Apps others use — the main issue with the Cambridge Analytica scandal was not only that they siphoned profiles of people that were taking an online quiz, but also managed to collect all of the data on those people's friends lists. In fact, many apps will do this — they will ask for access to your friends list and then collect names, pictures, bios, posts, current city, activities and so on. Enter this menu and turn off everything.","4. Old versions of Facebook for mobile — this menu should only concern you if you have an ancient smartphone with a really old Facebook. Back in the day, you couldn't choose which groups of people should be able to view your posts. This option here lets you lock in a default setting for a post's audience, in case you still use an old BlackBerry from time to time.","Once more, go back to Account Settings and enter the Ads sub-menu.","This is another interesting one — here, you will see what Facebook knows about your (potential) interests and let you remove them. Now, we wouldn't say this is exactly The Devil right here — if a person loves dogs and technology, we're pretty sure that they'd be delighted to get an ad about a new app that helps you train dogs, right? But, for the sake of privacy and awareness, take a good look at those menus and choose what you want to remove:","1. Your Interests — this lists the categories that Facebook thinks you like. Tap “See all your interests” if you want to delete some or all of them","2. Advertisers you've interacted with — this is an important sub-menu. It will not only show you which advertisers' ads you've clicked on, but also which one of them actually have your contact info.","3. Ad Settings — pretty basic, this is where you choose whether or not the data that Facebook has on you can be used to target you with ads that are more relevant to you.","4. Hide Ad Topics — this sub-menu can be used if you're tired of seeing ads for specific categories like games, pets, et cetera. You can disable Ad Topics for 6 months, 12 months, or forever.","Posting tips","Now that we've gone through the settings and permissions, it's time to have a real talk about what we are actually posting, liking, and sharing.","OK, Facebook is a social media and we obviously want to use it to get in touch with our social circles. So “Don't post at all!” is a pretty counter-intuitive tip. But really, do you need to tag yourself in every business you visit? Remember, we disabled location settings, but if you make a post saying “Down in Papa John's y'all!” and tag yourself you are kind of inviting","the Facebook algorithm to go \"Hey, this guy likes pizza!\".","And, of course, a crazy selfie shared among friends can do no harm. You may want to pay careful attention to your audience settings for every post — cycle through \"Public\" and \"Friends\" regularly. “But Facebook analyzes photos and now it knows how I look!”. Yeah, so does Google and Apple. Our point is — if you want to keep your mugshots out of digital farms, be really, really careful which cloud services you upload to. And do know that whatever you've uploaded thus far is there forever.","Make sure to pick your audience for every post","Whenever you like an article, that's recorded. Whenever you share it — Facebook remembers. So, remember that your Facebook profile is just an online avatar of yourself. And we advise you to sculpt and structure that avatar in a specific way — make it a character that is detached from you but still has your interests. For example, if you are interested in smartphones — by all means like, visit, and converse in smartphone-oriented pages. The ads you see will be relevant to your interests and everything that corporations will be able to learn about you from your profile is going to be “Yeah... this is Joe. He likes phones.”","On the other hand, sharing your family tree, doing a photo-dump of the last birthday party or wedding you attended, getting into every political or religious discussion, filling out your profile data to the T... those things might be a bit too much.","I used a fake name for many years. Just to keep in touch with family abroad. Out of the blue, Facebook deleted my account and asked me to provide them MY DRIVERS LICENSE and SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER to re-activate my account. (I'm dead serious.)\nTo hell with facebook.","Galaxy Note 9 liveblog: follow the announcement live!","All content (phone reviews, news, specs, info), design and layouts are Copyright 2001-2018 phoneArena.com.

But some experts are warning that no matter what Facebook does in the wake of its data scandal, your privacy is already gone.","At a mall near Stanford University, we gave shoppers a chance to experience the kind of Facebook data mining used by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm.

The impact of these revelations has led to millions being wiped off Facebook’s share price and an ongoing investigation into the incident.","Facebook under GDPR","Many businesses have grown weary of hearing about the major impact that GDPR will have on their operations – but this is no time to be complacent. Had the Facebook incident taken place after GDPR’s implementation on 25th May, the company would have been liable for a much more sizeable fine, up to 4% of its revenue.","Regardless of how much a company makes, the fines imposed by GDPR are not something to be taken lightly. To avoid the risk of stiff penalties, businesses need to fundamentally change how they manage their data. This not only means eliminating any outdated methods of processing client information, but also adopting new techniques that are in line with the rules set out by GDPR.","Changing data concerns","Historically, businesses have had very few restrictions over how they use information provided by their customers, clients and employees. However, this will no longer be the case once GDPR comes into effect. A number of new protections will apply, such as data subject consent, new encryption processes like pseudonymization, and the introduction of officers specifically tasked with ensuring company data is regulated.","In the past, security or information breaches were the only focus when it came to data compliance, but this will also change post-GDPR. Under these new rules, ignoring issues such as user consent or data transparency will leave companies vulnerable to serious sanctions from the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). As a result, traditional approaches to data security are no longer feasible. Instead, companies will need to have an effective framework to protect their customers’ data – not only today, but also in the future.","Customer obligations","Irrespective of a punitive regime or new regulations for corporates, customers have an equal role to play in protection of their own data. They have to make informed choices on potential uses of data, and the perils of a digital footprint. To some extent, it is best to follow the old adage ‘Better to be safe than sorry’ when it comes to widespread data sharing across anonymised technology platforms.","Applying the lessons","With such a short time left until GDPR comes into effect, there are some things that every business should be doing immediately to ensure compliance. First, all of the company’s data needs to be linked up, seamlessly and securely. Fragmented information is the easiest route to non-compliance but can often be the hardest to overcome.","The primary aim of any business meeting GDPR compliance is connecting this fragmented data. While this may not have been a challenge for Facebook, it is still a hurdle that many companies struggle to overcome. However, once data can be consolidated, the business will have a much clearer picture of how compliant it is.","Technology alone won’t be enough though; businesses can employ many different solutions in their pursuit of compliance, but these won’t deliver the best results unless a clear digital strategy is in place. Facebook has shown that even the most data savvy business can fail if it doesn’t respond to issues or inconsistency with its clients’ data. Should this happen under GDPR, many businesses would struggle to rebuild.","The ongoing developments with Facebook will become increasingly important as the date for GDPR draws ever nearer. Compliance requires a careful balance between technology that can provide data transparency and a clear strategy to ensure company data is not vulnerable.

Is it too big to fail? — Quartz","text":["Facebook is too big to fail","Over the last week or so, Facebook has been embroiled in a scandal over reports that Cambridge Analytica, the data firm hired by Donald Trump’s campaign to build targeted ads during the 2016 US election, harvested data from 50 million Facebook users without their consent. Executives at Cambridge Analytica have been caught bragging on camera that they helped fix elections, and that it ran the entire Trump campaign. Reports also resurfaced the fact that Facebook and Cambridge Analytica worked side by side at a Trump campaign office in San Antonio.","Facebook has seen more than $60 billion wiped off of its valuation over fears that the revelations will result in regulations on the digital advertising industry, dragging down the stock prices of other tech giants as well. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered an anodyne non-apology, saying many things have already been fixed and more changes are on the way, amid repeated calls for him to testify before Congress. The hashtag #deletefacebook has trended on Twitter.","As the scandal and backlash escalate, we begin to wonder how badly Facebook could be hurt. Does its dominant position in so many people’s’ lives, and the sheer amount of money it makes, mean that it’s untouchable? IsFacebook too big to fail? Quartz weighs the options.","Is Facebook going to get regulated?","Facebook has been Silicon Valley’s Goliath for long enough that it doesn’t seem to think a David exists. (And if it was worried at all, it would just buy David or copy his every move.) But Bill Gates might tell Zuckerberg otherwise. In the 1990s, US antitrust regulators put Microsoft’s Windows monopoly in its crosshairs. Gates’ combative, condescending testimony to the Department of Justice, and the Seattle software giant’s dismissal of its arguments, made it public enemy number one for the US regulators who ultimately clipped its wings.","Although the order to break up Microsoft was overturned by appeal, the company was never the same. The 21-year fight meant Microsoft was forced to curb aggressive practices in new markets. Products were made interoperable. The 2002 consent decree left Microsoft in the cold during the next evolution of the web, giving oxygen to rising stars like Google and Apple. Even more importantly, its culture changed. A hard-charging, risk-taking startup became a timid and declining company that has only recently seen its fortunes revive.","Facebook would be wise not to assume that regulators will play any nicer this time around. Microsoft’s sins never rose to enabling hostile nations to meddle in US presidential election. Microsoft’s lock on corporate America was probably never as dominant as Facebook’s control of advertising on social media. In February, Gates warned Silicon Valley that its time without government oversight was probably over. “The companies need to be careful that they’re not … advocating things that would prevent government from being able to, under appropriate review, perform the type of functions that we’ve come to count on,” he said. When asked if he sees that happening now, he replied, “Oh, absolutely.”","The lessons from Microsoft are that you don’t need to win an antitrust case to destroy a company, or put it on its heels for a generation. You probably can’t “break up” Facebook, but you can turn it into a timid shadow of its former self. A few choice rules under a consent decree would be all it takes: for example, no more acquisitions of companies like Instagram and WhatsApp. (But then, it still has those companies under its belt already.)","Is Facebook going to lose users?","Following the latest revelations, many people began declaring on other social networks that they were going to take a break from Facebook or delete it entirely. It’s definitely not a tiny group of dissenters—and it may very well turn out to be the largest exodus Facebook has ever faced. People didn’t trust Facebook to begin with.","What’s more, it follows already falling user numbers in the US and Canada, the company’s most profitable markets, and slowing user growth overall. However, when you consider just how large Facebook is, even if a million people left the platform in protest (which is about how many daily users the company lost in the US and Canada in the last quarter), it would be only 0.05% of its user base.","It’s hard to leave Facebook. It’s become such an entrenched part of people’s lives—a trove of a decade’s worth of memories, a place to find everyone you’d ever met, a digital passport of sorts, and a way to connect with your community.","Will Facebook lose customers?","One thing the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica mess has made abundantly clear is that users aren’t Facebook’s customers—advertisers are. The erosion of Facebook’s user base has driven some brands away from Facebook.","But most major marketers will need to see much bigger user drop offs before turning their backs a platform with Facebook’s reach. There would need to be double-digit percentage declines, and a substantial drop in usage among those still on the platform for advertisers to leave en masse, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.","“They have such a big platform that at this stage you don’t want to bet against the business,” said Wieser, one of the only analysts to have a “sell” rating on Facebook shares. “We’d have to see substantial erosion in the user base, and I don’t mean millions of users.”","Public backlash probably won’t drive advertisers away either, as it did on YouTube when ads were featured alongside extremist videos and videos that exploited children. The unsavory data harvesting on Facebook happens behind the scenes and is hard to tie to any one advertiser. And ad targeting is a major selling point of Facebook to marketers in the first place.","“Advertisers were already doing something not that far removed from Cambridge Analytica,” said Wieser. “You can’t shame any one advertiser because all advertisers were doing this.”","A few smaller advertisers, like Mozilla and Sonos, said this week that they would suspend Facebook ads to show customers how seriously they take data privacy. But they’ll be back. Mozilla, which told Quartz its annual Facebook budget was in the “low seven-digit range,” or about 10% of its overall marketing spend, said it will return when the platform is more transparent about how its data is being collected and used, especially by third-party apps. Speaker brand Sonos is pulling advertising from Facebook’s platforms, as well as Google and Twitter, for one week.","Even if a big advertiser like Procter & Gamble or Coca-Cola was so irked by Facebook’s methods that they decided to abandon ship—and the domino effect led others to follow—big change wouldn’t come overnight. It would take a quarter or two to shift that spending. More practically, brands would start to rethink where they put their money when the big fall and holiday seasons come around.","What’s more likely is that advertisers will reassess how they’re using Facebook in light of the data privacy uproar. They’ll play closer attention to their tracking methods to make sure they don’t become the next Cambridge Analytica.","“There’s already a level of scrutiny, but brands are also under a lot of pressure,” said Michael Horn, managing director of data science at the digital agency Huge. “They don’t want to pull back from a massively abundant source of audience. … In the end, it might lead to money being spent in different places or just in different ways within the same platform.”","Will Facebook lose anything at all?","Is this the beginning of the end for Facebook? Will advertisers and users start fleeing the platform, now that they realize just how little Facebook seems to care about individuals’ privacy? When it comes to dominant companies having their position challenged, we have, in some ways, been here before.","Many US tech giants have faced what now may await Facebook. As Microsoft spent a large part of the late-1990s and 2000s fighting antitrust suits against its monopolistic position in computer software. As that happened, it missed the mobile revolution, failing to effectively pivot from desktop to smartphone software.","Around the same time, Yahoo, once a dominant search engine and email provider, failed to see the threat of Google and mobile search. At its peak, it was worth over $100 billion, but was sold for parts to Verizon in 2016 for less than $5 billion. Another US giant, IBM, ceded its dominance when it was still trying to sell mainframes to a computer market that had shifted to PCs. In all cases, users fled the platforms in search of better options. Microsoft was able to recover, thanks to smart leadership and new business lines; Yahoo could not; and IBM has spent the better part of a decade trying to figure out which direction to pivot toward while relying on legacy businesses for revenue.","But there has really never been an internet company quite like Facebook. MySpace, the original social-networking phenomenon, only had around 100 million users at its peak. That’s a twentieth of Facebook’s current size. There are around 3.8 billion internet users, and 2.1 billion are Facebook users, meaning a majority of people on the internet at some point each month check Facebook. It also controls Instagram, which has 800 million users, and WhatsApp, which has 1.3 billion users.","Facebook generated over $40 billion in revenue in 2017. Its market capitalization is currently around $460 billion, even with the massive stock sell-off that took place last week. According to its most recent earnings statement, it has about $10 billion in total liabilities, but about $84 billion in assets. That means that even if Facebook somehow lost all its advertisers and users over this debacle, it would still be able to keep the lights on for a long time.","Part of the business concern over the current scandal is that Facebook would lose its most valuable users if there’s an exodus of Western users. The global average revenue per user is around $6 per quarter, but for users based in North America, it’s nearly $27 per quarter. In the developing world, where many of Facebook’s newer users are found, Facebook generates significantly less revenue: Outside of Europe, Asia, and North America, the average revenue per user is just $2 per quarter.","It’ll be some time before we see any financial ramifications from the Cambridge Analytica fallout. Facebook, like just about every other public company, reports its earnings quarterly, so most likely, we won’t hear anything until the end of April or early May, when Facebook traditionally reports on its first quarter results. As we’ve argued, it’s unlikely that there will have been much advertiser or user exodus by then. But in the months and years ahead, will we see any change to Facebook’s business? Even if users decamp, there isn’t anywhere particularly great to leave to that isn’t Facebook-owned. And as BuzzFeed’s Alex Kantrowitz pointed out, Facebook actually went up in app-store rankings this week, so it doesn’t really seem like the #deletefacebook movement has had much of an impact yet.","Perhaps, over time, this will be the straw that breaks the camel’s back for many users, or perhaps they’ll realize that this is just how life on the internet is, and decide being connected to everyone they’ve ever known and loved is worth being exploited. Or perhaps, as some analysts believe, Facebook will become the next MySpace and we will all eventually get bored and move on. But it feels like it would take a lot to lose 2 billion people overnight."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

But internet giants have little incentive to give straight answers — even to simple questions like, “Why am I being shown this ad?”","On May 25, however, the power balance will shift towards consumers, thanks to a European privacy law that restricts how personal data is collected and handled. The rule, called General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, focuses on ensuring that users know, understand, and consent to the data collected about them. Under GDPR, pages of fine print won’t suffice. Neither will forcing users to click yes in order to sign up.","Instead, companies must be clear and concise about their collection and use of personal data like full name, home address, location data, IP address, or the identifier that tracks web and app use on smartphones. Companies have to spell out why the data is being collected and whether it will be used to create profiles of people’s actions and habits. Moreover, consumers will gain the right to access data companies store about them, the right to correct inaccurate information, and the right to limit the use of decisions made by algorithms, among others.","The law protects individuals in the 28 member countries of the European Union, even if the data is processed elsewhere. That means GDPR will apply to publishers like WIRED; banks; universities; much of the Fortune 500; the alphabet soup of ad-tech companies that track you across the web, devices, and apps; and Silicon Valley tech giants.","As an example of the law’s reach, the European Commission, the EU’s legislative arm, says on its website that a social network will have to comply with a user request to delete photos the user posted as a minor — and inform search engines and other websites that used the photos that the images should be removed. The commission also says a car-sharing service may request a user’s name, address, credit card number, and potentially whether the person has a disability, but can’t require a user to share their race. (Under GDPR, stricter conditions apply to collecting “sensitive data,” such as race, religion, political affiliation, and sexual orientation.)","GDPR has already spurred, or contributed to, changes in data-collection and -handling practices. In June, Google announced that it would stop mining emails in Gmail to personalize ads. (The company says that was unrelated to GDPR and done in order to harmonize the consumer and business versions of Gmail.) In September, Google revamped its privacy dashboard, first launched in 2009, to be more user-friendly. In January, Facebook announced its own privacy dashboard, which has yet to launch. Though the law applies only in Europe, the companies are making changes globally, because it’s simpler than creating different systems.","The law’s impact will extend well past the web giants. In March, Drawbridge, an ad-tech company that tracks users across devices, said it would wind down its advertising business in the EU because it’s unclear how the digital ad industry would ensure consumer consent. Acxiom, a data broker that provides information on more than 700 million people culled from voter records, purchasing behavior, vehicle registration, and other sources, is revising its online portals in the US and Europe where consumers can see what information Acxiom has about them. GDPR “will set the tone for data protection around the world for the next 10 years,” says Sheila Colclasure, Acxiom’s chief data ethics officer.","Beyond such moves, the law’s emphasis on consent, control, and clear explanations could prompt users to better understand and reconsider the ways they are surveilled online. Meanwhile, privacy activists plan to use GDPR as a weapon to force changes in corporate data-handling practices.","In short, the law is a chance to flip the economics of the industry. Since the dawn of the commercial web, companies have been financially incentivized to hoover up data and monetize later. Now, EU consumers will have the freedom to opt in, rather than the burden of opting out. That emphasis on consent creates a financial reward to building consumer trust.","GDPR presents “a real chance to renegotiate the terms of engagement between people, their data, and the company,” rather than mindlessly clicking away a terms-of-service agreement, says David Carroll, associate professor of media design at The New School. Carroll says data collected by activists “might be the basis for new investigations and ways to keep the companies accountable.”","The need for transparency and accountability is more vital than ever. Clicking to accept an impenetrable terms-of-service document once seemed like a no-brainer. The upside was incredible efficiency and the downside, it seemed, was just some annoying shoe ads stalking you around the web. But the past year has shown how the same personal data has been weaponized to suppress minority voters, radicalize young white men, exploit political beliefs to sow division, and possibly swing elections. In a white paper called “Corporate Surveillance in Everyday Life,” researcher Wolfie Christl diagrams how personal data is used to influence behavior and determine what products you see, what services you have access to, and what prices you pay in areas from shopping to banking. “Every time we click, these companies are trying to figure out, is this a valuable person or this is a worthless person?” Christl says.","Most of the data rights enshrined under GDPR were already established in the EU, but went unenforced. GDPR standardizes data rights across all EU countries, empowering regulators with the same big stick and sharper teeth. Violators face fines of up to 4 percent of annual global revenue. For Facebook, that would be $1.6 billion; for Google, $4.4 billion.","Of course, the law has its share of detractors, who dismiss GDPR as more protectionism from the EU, which has challenged American tech platforms on antitrust and privacy grounds with expensive consequences. Then there are concerns about cost. Colclasure from Acxiom calls the data industry the backbone of “free content and free knowledge” online. “It’s either hit a pay wall or these sites are ad-supported for the most part,” she says.","There are potential loopholes in the law. It allows businesses to process personal data without consent for limited reasons, including a business’s “legitimate interests,” which the European Commission says includes “direct marketing,” through mail, email, or online ads.","However, even then companies must take into account a consumer’s expectation of how their data will be used and can’t infringe on the other consumer rights guaranteed under GDPR. In the digital realm, EU consumers also have the added protection of a companion set of rules, called the ePrivacy Directive, that govern electronic communication. Under those rules, which are in the process of being ratified into law, consent is the only legal basis for collecting personal data.","David Martin, senior legal officer at the European Consumer Organisation, an umbrella group of 43 consumer groups, says tech company lobbyists are working to influence the guidelines to interpret GDPR and weaken the ePrivacy language.","Avoidance isn’t an option. In 2017, Facebook’s revenue per user in Europe grew 41 percent from a year earlier, to $8.86. The rate of increase was faster than any other region.","In a statement to WIRED, Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, said, “Everyone on Facebook will see improvements to their tools and privacy controls this year. In addition to GDPR, we're looking at things across the board to see how we can give people more control and do more to help them understand how their data is used.” Google directed WIRED to a 2017 blog post where the company said it “is committed to complying with the GDPR across all of the services that we provide in Europe,” including Google search, Gmail, and all of its advertising and measurement services.","Privacy activists believe the law will unlock the data they need to force other changes. It’s worked before. A lawsuit filed against Facebook in 2013 by Austrian lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems led to a ruling striking down a “Safe Harbor” agreement that companies used to transfer data between the US and Europe. Schrems’ case is pending.","Emboldened by the approach of GDPR, Schrems in November launched a nonprofit called None of Your Business that will use GDPR to “confront tech giants like Facebook, Google & Co. with a team of highly qualified and motivated lawyers and IT experts on equal footing,\" the group said in a statement.","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a mathematician and cofounder of PersonalData.IO, has used UK data protection law to help individuals access personal information processed by Cambridge Analytica, the controversial firm behind the data breach affecting more than 50 million Facebook users. Dehaye believes that GDPR could help pry out more information.","GDPR’s ultimate impact will rest on how aggressively consumers wield their new rights. Recent trends indicate a growing interest in privacy. The use of ad-blockers and VPNs is on the rise in the US and elsewhere. Corporations have responded to the demand. In August, Mozilla introduced Firefox Focus, a private mobile browser. In September, Apple added tracking prevention to its Safari browser.","Fatemeh Khatibloo, a principal analyst at Forrester, thinks the end result will be more progressive data-collection practices. Consumers would be shocked to know the number of cookies, trackers, and ad servers firing on the web pages they visit, she says.","In a survey of UK consumers Khatibloo conducted in August, 51 percent of respondents said they were at least somewhat likely to exercise their new rights under GDPR. The most common example cited was data deletion. “People felt they could ‘punish’ the companies that were invasive or aggressive by asking them to delete their information,” she says.","Still, Khatibloo is skeptical that GDPR will spook users of popular internet services. Consumers understand the value of exchanging their data for free services and don’t want their online experience interrupted, she says. GDPR “sheds very bright light on some of the data machination that people aren’t aware of, but I don’t think that there’s going to be a huge Facebook reckoning.”","Much may turn on how companies ask for consent. In September, PageFair, which helps publishers deal with ad blockers, conducted a survey in which it presented users with choices for being tracked, such as “only accept first party tracking” or “reject tracking unless it’s strictly necessary for the services requested.” Of the 300 people surveyed, only about 5 percent consented to all tracking.","Marketing firm Criteo is aiming for something much less intrusive. In January, Digiday published a sample consent interface that Criteo was testing.

The problem is federal laws may have been broken. #Tucker","Controversy continues to swirl around how the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica obtained personal data from over 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge and used it to target ads to individuals in an effort to help Donald Trump be elected president in 2016.","Continue Reading Below","But a more serious case of apparent misconduct involves Facebook data going to a different presidential campaign – this time in 2012. In this case, which is getting far less attention, Facebook reportedly voluntarily provided data on millions of its users to the re-election campaign of President Obama.","If true, such action by Facebook may constitute a major violation of federal campaign finance law as an illegal corporate campaign contribution. The matter should be investigated by the Federal Election Commission – an agency I am quite familiar with, because I served as one of its commissioners from 2006 to 2007. The commission enforces campaign finance laws for congressional and presidential elections.","A federal law bans corporations from making “direct or indirect” contributions to federal candidates. That ban extends beyond cash contributions to “any services, or anything of value.” In other words, corporations cannot provide federal candidates with free services of any kind. Under the Federal Election Commission’s regulations, “anything of value” includes any “in-kind contribution.”","Whether or not the Obama campaign and Facebook violated this ban is an open question. It should be investigated by the Federal Election Commission and potentially the U.S. Department of Justice.","For example, if a corporation decided to offer a presidential candidate free office space, that would violate federal law. Corporations can certainly offer their services, including office space, to federal campaigns. But the campaigns are required to pay the fair market value for such services or rental properties.","According to Carol Davidsen, the former media director for Obama for America, Facebook gave the 2012 Obama campaign direct access to the personal data of Facebook users in violation of its internal rules, making a special exception for the campaign. The Daily Mail, a British newspaper, reported that Davidsen saidon Twitter March 18 that Facebook employees came to the campaign office and “were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.”","Continue Reading Below","The type of data that the Obama campaign was mining from Facebook is a more sophisticated version of the type of data that has long been provided by professional direct mail marketers – something pioneered by Richard Viguerie. Viguerie, for example, has detailed personal data on “12 million conservative donors and activists” to whom his company sends letters and emails on behalf of his clients. He provides information to campaigns looking for votes and money, and to nonprofit and advocacy organizations raising funds.","Political campaigns must pay for these services. Under a Federal Election Commission regulation, giving a mailing list or something similar to a campaign is considered an “in-kind contribution.”","So if Facebook gave the Obama campaign free access to this type of data when it normally does not do so for other entities – or usually charges for such access – then Facebook would appear to have violated the federal ban on in-kind contributions by a corporation. And the Obama campaign may have violated the law by accepting such a corporate contribution.","What about the story currently in the news about Cambridge Analytica using Facebook data for the Trump campaign? The important legal distinction may be in the way the data were obtained. Fox News reported that the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica to do political research on voters and reportedly to “help the campaign target specific voters with ads and stories.”","The real controversy now involving the Trump campaign deals with exactly how Cambridge Analytica obtained the data it used for the campaign. A CNBC report says that Cambridge Analytica bought the data from Aleksandr Kogan and his company, Global Science Research, which obtained the data through an app and a psychological test taken by Facebook users.","The amounts paid by the Trump campaign to Cambridge Analytica for its services – and the use of the Facebook data – are listed in its spending reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. This proves that the Trump campaign paid for services in the same way that campaigns routinely hire and pay direct mail marketers. So the Trump campaign did not get an illegal corporate contribution from Cambridge Analytica or Facebook when it received free access to very valuable data.","Whether or not Global Science Research and Cambridge Analytica violated any Facebook rules regarding this data is not the responsibility of the Trump campaign. From the standpoint of federal campaign finance law, the Trump campaign met its obligation to pay for and report this spending and did not violate the ban on corporate contributions.","However, whether or not the Obama campaign and Facebook violated this ban is an open question. It should be investigated by the Federal Election Commission and potentially the U.S. Department of Justice. The commission handles most routine violations of the law, which are civil matters. The Justice Department is responsible for investigating knowing and intentional violations of the law, which are criminal matters.","Although the statute of limitations may have already run out on this conduct by the Obama campaign, one thing seems certain: Carol Davidsen’s admissions should provide a sufficient basis for opening a federal investigation of what may have been a serious violation of the law by the Obama campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

If you listen to the podcast, you’ll recognize some of the names as colleagues, partners and friends of Ben from Salient, any number of past lives, and the growing circle of outspoken truth-seekers in financial services and beyond.","Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, writing Thursday in the journal Science, analyzed anonymous credit-card transactions by 1.1 million people. Using a new analytic formula, they needed only four bits of secondary information—metadata such as location or timing—to identify the unique individual purchasing patterns of 90% of the people involved, even when the data were scrubbed of any names, account numbers or other obvious identifiers.","Still not sure what this means? It means that I don’t need your name and address, much less your social security number, to know who you ARE. With a trivial amount of transactional data I can figure out where you live, what you do, who you associate with, what you buy and what you sell. I don’t need to steal this data, and frankly I wouldn’t know what to do with your social security number even if I had it … it would just slow down my analysis. No, you give me everything I need just by living your very convenient life, where you’ve volunteered every bit of transactional information in the fine print of all of these wondrous services you’ve signed up for. And if there’s a bit more information I need – say, a device that records and transmits your driving habits – well, you’re only too happy to sell that to me for a few dollars off your insurance policy. After all, you’ve got nothing to hide. It’s free money!","Almost every investor I know believes that the tools of surveillance and Big Data are only used against the marginalized Other – terrorist “sympathizers” in Yemen, gang “associates” in Compton – but not us. Oh no, not us. And if those tools are trained on us, it’s only to promote “transparency” and weed out the bad guys lurking in our midst. Or maybe to suggest a movie we’d like to watch. What could possibly be wrong with that? I’ve written a lot (here, here, and here) about what’s wrong with that, about how the modern fetish with transparency, aided and abetted by technology and government, perverts the core small-l liberal institutions of markets and representative government.","It’s not that we’re complacent about our personal information. On the contrary, we are obsessed about the personal “keys” that are meaningful to humans – names, social security numbers, passwords and the like – and we spend billions of dollars and millions of hours every year to control those keys, to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands of other humans. But we willingly hand over a different set of keys to non-human hands without a second thought.","The problem is that our human brains are wired to think of data processing in human ways, and so we assume that computerized systems process data in these same human ways, albeit more quickly and more accurately. Our science fiction is filled with computer systems that are essentially god-like human brains, machines that can talk and “think” and manipulate physical objects, as if sentience in a human context is the pinnacle of data processing! This anthropomorphic bias drives me nuts, as it dampens both the sense of awe and the sense of danger we should be feeling at what already walks among us. It seems like everyone and his brother today are wringing their hands about AI and some impending “Singularity”, a moment of future doom where non-human intelligence achieves some human-esque sentience and decides in Matrix-like fashion to turn us into batteries or some such. Please. The Singularity is already here. Its name is Big Data.","Big Data is magic, in exactly the sense that Arthur C. Clarke wrote of sufficiently advanced technology. It’s magic in a way that thermonuclear bombs and television are not, because for all the complexity of these inventions they are driven by cause and effect relationships in the physical world that the human brain can process comfortably, physical world relationships that might not have existed on the African savanna 2,000,000 years ago but are understandable with the sensory and neural organs our ancestors evolved on that savanna. Big Data systems do not “see” the world as we do, with merely 3 dimensions of physical reality. Big Data systems are not social animals, evolved by nature and trained from birth to interpret all signals through a social lens. Big Data systems are sui generis, a way of perceiving the world that may have been invented by human ingenuity and can serve human interests, but are utterly non-human and profoundly not of this world.","A Big Data system couldn’t care less if it has your specific social security number or your specific account ID, because it’s not understanding who you are based on how you identify yourself to other humans. That’s the human bias here, that a Big Data system would try to predict our individual behavior based on an analysis of what we individually have done in the past, as if the computer were some super-advanced version of Sherlock Holmes. No, what a Big Data system can do is look at ALL of our behaviors, across ALL dimensions of that behavior, and infer what ANY of us would do under similar circumstances. It’s a simple concept, really, but what the human brain can’t easily comprehend is the vastness of the ALL part of the equation or what it means to look at the ALL simultaneously and in parallel. I’ve been working with inference engines for almost 30 years now, and while I think that I’ve got unusually good instincts for this and I’ve been able to train my brain to kinda sorta think in multi-dimensional terms, the truth is that I only get glimpses of what’s happening inside these engines. I can channel the magic, I can appreciate the magic, and on a purely symbolic level I can describe the magic. But on a fundamental level I don’t understand the magic, and neither does any other human. What I can say to you with absolute certainty, however, is that the magic exists and there are plenty of magicians like me out there, with more graduating from MIT and Harvard and Stanford every year.","Here’s the magic trick that I’m worried about for investors.","In exactly the same way that we have given away our personal behavioral data to banks and credit card companies and wireless carriers and insurance companies and a million app providers, so are we now being tempted to give away our portfolio behavioral data to mega-banks and mega-asset managers and the technology providers who work with them. Don’t worry, they say, there’s nothing in this information that identifies you directly. It’s all anonymous. What rubbish! With enough anonymous portfolio behavioral data and a laughably small IT budget, any competent magician can design a Big Data system that can predict with 90% accuracy what you will buy and sell in your account, at what price you will buy and sell, and under what external macro conditions you will buy and sell. Every day these private data sets at the mega-market players get bigger and bigger, and every day we get closer and closer to a Citadel or a Renaissance perfecting their Inference Machine for the liquid capital markets. For all I know, they already have.","But wait, you say, can’t government regulators do something about this? I suppose they could, but it seems to me that government agencies and regulatory offices are far more concerned about their own data collection projects than oversight of private efforts to absorb our behavioral keys. For one such project, read this Jason Zweig “Intelligent Investor” column in the Wall Street Journal from last May (“Get Ready for Regulators to Peer Into Your Portfolio”). I was happy to see that Congressman Garrett, Chair of the relevant Financial Services Sub-Committee, raised his hand to delay this particular data collection project, at least temporarily, last October. But it’s only a delay. The bureaucratic imperative to collect as much data as possible – for no other reason than that they can! – is too great of an irresistible force to contain for long. And once it’s collected it never just goes away. It sits there in some database, like a vault full of plutonium, just waiting for some magician to come along. In the Golden Age of the Central Banker, where understanding and controlling market behavior is at the heart of regime survival, this data is quite literally priceless. That’s why I get so depressed about these government data collection programs. Despite everyone’s best intentions, I fear that the magic is too easy and the political pay-off is too enormous not to uncork the bottle and unleash the genie at some point.","So what’s to be done? Big Data technology cannot be un-invented, insanely powerful private entities are collecting our data at an exponential clip, government regulators are fighting the last war instead of preparing for this one, and we are hard-wired as human beings to have a blind spot to the danger. Maybe the best we can do is come to terms with our loss and prepare ourselves as best we can for the Brave New World to come. I’ve become a fan of Paul Kingsnorth, an ardent environmentalist (profiled last year in a fascinating NYT Magazine article) who reached just that conclusion about his nemesis, global industrialization and the ruin of the natural world. His conclusion: the war is already lost and we are deluding ourselves if we think that any of our oh-so-earnest conservation or sustainability or green projects make any difference whatsoever. Instead, Kingsnorth writes, better to work on your scythe technique and spend quality time with your family on a little farm in Ireland.","But I think there’s a better answer.","I started this note with a poem by Edward Thomas, who uses the imagery of the English countryside to express loss and remembrance. Like the beautiful grove of trees Thomas writes about, many of the beautiful things we take for granted in our small-l liberal world are only noticed after we see them suffer the woodsman’s axe.","Thomas was killed in action at the Battle of Arras in World War I. He was 39 years old, survived by his wife and five children. Two years earlier, he had enlisted as a private in the British Infantry, joining a regiment known as the Artists Rifles. I know it sounds really bizarre to the modern ear for a middle-aged family man, an author and literary critic no less, volunteering to fight as an infantry private in a horrific war to defend another country. But it wasn’t just Thomas. Over 15,000 men served in the Artists Rifles over the course of World War I, the majority of them men of similar position and social status as Thomas – creative professionals, doctors, lawyers, and the like. Imagine that … 15,000 highly educated and successful men, volunteering to slog it out in the trenches of an absolutely brutal war, sacrificing everything for what they understood as their duty to their families and their countrymen. And sacrifice they did: 2,003 killed, 3,250 wounded, 533 missing, 286 prisoners of war. John Nash’s masterpiece of the Great War, “Over The Top”, commemorates a December 1917 counter-attack (Thomas had died 6 months earlier) by the 1st Battalion (really a terribly under-sized sub-battalion) of The Artists Rifles. Of the 80 men in the 1st Artists Rifles, 68 were killed or wounded within minutes.","John Nash, “Over the Top” (1918)","Now this may sound really sappy, but if men like Edward Thomas – who saw clearly and experienced keenly how modernity and mass society were agents of loss in their world – could still find it within themselves to sacrifice everything to fight what they considered to be the good fight … well, how can we who are similarly positioned today not make a minute sacrifice to do the same?","What is that good fight? It’s resisting the bureaucratic urge to gather more data for more data’s sake. It’s shouting from the rooftops that anonymous data does NOT protect your identity. Most of all, it’s recognizing that powerful private interests are taking our behavioral keys away from us in plain sight and with our cooperation. Just that simple act of recognition will change your data-sharing behavior forever, and if enough of us change our behavior to protect our non-human keys with the same zeal that we protect our social security numbers and passwords, then this battle can be won.\nLike all battles, though, there’s no substitute for numbers. If you share the concerns I’ve outlined here, spread the word …"],"isopubdate":"2015-02-03"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.

If she had, police could have put her face, her full name and several digits of her ID card number on a public bulletin board for everyone to see. \"Jaywalkers have fewer rights than criminal suspects,\" she wrote, pointing out that in Chinese news reports, suspects are often not fully identified and their faces are blotted out.","Mao Yan's Shenzhen is part of one of the great social experiments of mankind - the use of massive amounts of data, combined with facial recognition technology, shaming and artificial intelligence to control a population via marriage of the state and private companies. Already on the packed highways of Shanghai, honking has decreased. That's because directional microphones coupled with high-definition cameras can identify and ticket - again, via WeChat - noisy drivers and display their names, photographs and identity card numbers on the city's many LED boards. On some streets, if drivers stop their cars by the side of the road longer than seven minutes, high-definition cameras identify the driver and, again, issue him or her an instant ticket.","In other parts of China the technology is being used by the state security apparatus to crack down on separatism. In Xinjiang, which has been the site of a separatist movement against Chinese rule, China's police have established a 21st-century police state through an infrastructure of security technology with high-definition cameras, facial-recognition technology, iris and body scanners at checkpoints, the forced collection of DNA, and the mandatory use of apps that monitor messages on smartphones. The focus of this campaign is the Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic group that is mostly Muslim.","But as Mao Yan's story makes clear, this technology is bleeding into the rest of China, where 95 percent of the population is Han Chinese. And China's authorities won't be content with traffic stops. Their goal is behavioral modification on a massive scale. Chinese planners have announced their intention to tap the vast AI and surveillance infrastructure currently under construction to generate \"social credit\" scores for all of China's 1.5 billion people. With a high score, traveling, securing a loan, buying a car and other benefits will be easy to come by. Run afoul of the authorities, and problems begin.","Some Chinese businessmen who are benefiting from this massive investment in data have argued that the Chinese are less concerned about privacy than people in the United States. Robin Li, the founder of Baidu, China's version of Google, which routinely shares its data with the Chinese Communist Party, argued over the weekend that Chinese people don't care that much about privacy.","\"The Chinese people are more open or less sensitive about the privacy issue,\" said Li, speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing. \"If they are able to trade privacy for convenience, safety and efficiency, in a lot of cases, they are willing to do that.\"","Ironically, Li's remarks were released by the Chinese magazine Caixin on the same day that Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology for releasing user data to a political consultancy.","In her article, Mao Yan didn't seem to agree with Li's optimistic interpretation of the campaign. \"Maybe,\" she wrote, \"it's intimidation to make everyone afraid.\" I think she's right. Hours after Mao Yan posted her story on China's Internet, censors took it down."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Framed the President - The New York Times","text":["Trump Hires Lawyer Who Has Pushed Theory That Justice Dept. Framed the President","Video","President Trump hired the outspoken lawyer Joseph E. diGenova on Monday. Mr. diGenova is an aggressive voice who attacks the F.B.I. and defends the president.Published OnMarch 20, 2018CreditCreditImage by C-Span","MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Trump hired the longtime Washington lawyer Joseph E. diGenova on Monday, adding an aggressive voice to his legal team who has pushed the theory on television that the F.B.I. and Justice Department framed Mr. Trump.","Mr. diGenova, a former United States attorney, is not expected to take a lead role. But he will serve as an outspoken player for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump broke over the weekend from the longstanding advice of some of his lawyers that he refrain from directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a sign of his growing unease with the investigation.","“Former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers. “I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.”","Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president. “There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”","Little evidence has emerged to support that theory.","Mr. Trump’s legal team has been in tumult in recent weeks. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at the time that he was speaking for the president but later backtracked. According to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging to call for an end to the inquiry.","Earlier this month, Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers that he was in discussions with another Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, about representing him. Mr. Flood represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.","Mr. diGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. Ms. Toensing has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.","Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who supposedly had damaging information on Hillary Clinton.","Mr. diGenova has worked in Washington legal circles for decades. He is a former Republican-appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia. And he has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George H.W. Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton.","Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role of the independent counsel — as defined in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal — ought to be narrowed.","Drawing on his own experience, Mr. diGenova said in 1998 that the law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, should not be renewed. He argued that once the independent counsel law was invoked, the prosecutors were forced into bringing “an unnatural degree of targeted attention” to the case. In 1999, the United States Congress let the independent counsel portions of the law expire."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}
{"originalurl":"https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-trust-in-facebook/","title":"Mark Zuckerberg's Silence on Cambridge Analytica Has Done Irreversible Damage | WIRED","text":["The Irreversible Damage of Mark Zuckerberg’s Silence","Share","The Irreversible Damage of Mark Zuckerberg’s Silence","David Ramos/Getty Images","“I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform,” wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement that addressed a series of news stories reporting Facebook’s data had been misused. In the 937-word statement, posted on his Facebook profile Wednesday afternoon, Zuckerberg outlined all that Facebook has done and plans to do to keep our data safe.","But while he has addressed the news issue he hasn’t addressed the underlying problem. By the time Mark Zuckerberg made his amends it was already too late.","What has happened in the last five days has been the biggest crisis of Facebook’s existence. But Zuckerberg’s five-day silent treatment may prove more damning for Facebook than any of the news that precipitated it. This wouldn’t be nearly as extreme crisis for most companies. When bad things happen at other Fortune 500 companies, there is a script they follow—call it good crisis PR. The head of communications promises to look into an issue. A CEO makes a statement, well-reviewed by the legal team beforehand. If the crisis is really bad, someone resigns or gets fired. Once the perceived villain has been held accountable, everyone returns to normal unscathed. These corporate theatrics have come to embody the acceptable approach to business accountability.","But Facebook has always been a different kind of company—billing itself as a more intimate, personal service than, say, a car manufacturer (like Volkswagen) or an oil distributor (like BP). After all, what Facebook is selling is intimacy: a place to house your thoughts and opinions, and connect to friends and family. You can trust Facebook—you have to! You friends are here! And your number one friend, Mark Zuckerberg, is always at the ready to tell you what Facebook is doing and why.","But Facebook has always been a different kind of company—billing\nitself as an more intimate, personal service","Until the past year, this approach to building Facebook has been Zuckerberg’s chief asset. He intuited earlier than most that a decade after the internet’s introduction, people had begun to trust individuals over companies, and the best way to build a 21st century business was to build it in the guise of a person. As he told Bloomberg BusinessWeek last fall, “People trust people, not institutions.”","The service he built has only accelerated this shift. By its nature, Facebook elevates individuals while deprecating institutions. Individuals are the atoms, connecting to one another to spread information. Institutions get “pages,” which can be liked and shared—or ignored—by those people. Facebook’s role in society has been to transfer to individuals many of the activities, like recommending news articles, sourcing vacation destinations, and figuring out the best twin stroller for city dwellers, that used to reside with institutions.","But for Facebook to succeed in the midst of this shift in authority, Zuckerberg knew it needed a relatable individual to be a stand-in for the company—a recognizable, authentic voice who users felt they knew. That proxy would be Zuckerberg. So, as the service has grown from a place for college kids’ to poke each other to a global communications utility, he has repositioned himself into a pseudo-statesman. He has spoken at the United Nations General Assembly. He has started a hybrid philanthropy and investment outfit to put his billiions of dollars to work in service of solving intractable social problems. Last year he traveled to all fifty states, photographer in tow. All of this has been documented on his Facebook profile, along with photos in which he’s baking with his wife for the Jewish holidays or celebrating the Chinese New Year with his children. Inside Facebook, there are communications professionals dedicated to reviewing and ghostwriting his posts, and helping him craft and maintain this profile, which has more than 105 million followers. (For context, that’s just less than the total subscriber base of Netflix.)","Zuckerberg intuited that a decade after the internet’s\nintroduction, people had begun to trust individuals over\ncompanies","Early on, this strategy worked. Facebook’s users were, like Zuckerberg, American Ivy Leaguers interested in using his network for similar things—dating, posting drunk selfies, dating. Facebook’s problems were comparably narrow, and when the company clashed with users—usually by overstepping in the way it introduced new services, causing users to fear they were ceding too much control of personal information—Zuckerberg could speak to them directly. The first such letter I remember arrived in September 2006, just after Facebook launched the News Feed. “We really messed this one up,” it began. He explained himself, asked for patience, and suggested a fix. This approach became Zuckerberg’s playbook for addressing problems. It mostly worked. Facebookers forgave Zuckerberg, er, Facebook—or at least continued to use its service.","But over this past year, this approach has frayed. Increasingly, it has become obvious there are things our friend Zuckerberg isn’t telling us. In February, this magazine put a battered image of Zuckerberg on the cover, detailing the company’s desperate efforts to address news and information. Now comes the revelation that for several years, Facebook allowed third parties to access vast amounts of our personal information, and the company was both lax in monitoring how those groups used that data, and slow to address abuse when it was discovered. These facts reveal Facebook’s struggles over how to address the challenges that the openness it has always prized has wrought. They raise questions about the degree to which Facebook has acted and is acting in the best interest of its users, and suggest the possibility that Facebook has, at times, covered up information. And they force us all to ask: Can Mark Zuckerberg be trusted?","This is an existential question for the company. Because there’s one great challenge with empowering trust in people over institutions: People are fickle. They change. They disappoint. Sometimes, in moments of crisis, they ghost us. Individuals are easily taken down by a moment that shifts our perception of their character. Which leaves Facebook’s leader with an unenviable task: If Zuckerberg wants us to believe now that his company is not vulnerable, he must shore up trust in himself as an individual. It’s his only way forward.","For the past five days, government officials have summoned Zuckerberg to speak. Journalists have demanded to hear from him. His own employees have used Twitter and even Facebook to try to stand up for the company he started, but he’s been absent. He didn’t show up at the company’s own internal staff meeting on Tuesday afternoon. Finally, he has weighed in, with, of course, a Facebook post and the promise of a television interview. Less than a half hour later, the post had 3,100 comments. “So basically you knew this shit was going on years ago and NOW since you've been caught with your pants down, this is your response?” one commenter wrote, summarizing a particularly common response. “Pathetic. I really do hope Congress makes you testify.”","It will take more than charming posts showing Zuckerberg baking in his kitchen to appease the regulators who are now stepping up, and countless displays of intimacy to win back the trust of his users.","Trust in Zuckerberg","Facebook is inextricably linked to Mark Zuckerberg. That’s been his greatest advantage, but now could be his undoing.","Facebook doesn’t share much of its data with researchers and their lack of access limits their work and our knowledge of social networks."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board.","The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","Tony Romm contributed to this report.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

While the company ultimately plans to expand into an array of businesses, its initial focus is on hydroponic farming, using software and sensors to monitor growing conditions. (Its first farm is on Lanai, the Hawaiian island of which Mr. Ellison owns roughly 98 percent.)","Sensei’s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.","“So far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,” Dr. Agus said in a statement. “To properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.”","Its first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.","But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.","“For so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,” Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei’s president, said in a statement. “Now, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.”","Facebook’s slide drags down FANG stocks.","Facebook’s stock had its worst day in about four years.","Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.","The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world’s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry’s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.","Facebook’s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.","“We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group.","Facebook’s woes showed signs of spreading, too.","The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index’s 11 sectors.","Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.","In all, Monday’s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.","Fund flows added fuel to the selloff. MoneyBeat’s Akane Otani reports that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds tracking U.S. technology stocks posted a record $2.6 billion in net inflows last week, according to data from fund tracker EPFR Global. That put year-to-date inflows at $47.5 billion.","Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.","The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 336 points, or 1.35 percent, while the S.&P. 500, was off nearly 39 points, or 1.42 percent.","Photo","A senator demanded that Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a British lawmaker has called for him to testify in an inquiry into the “Brexit” referendum.Credit\nJim Wilson/The New York Times","The latest test to Zuckerberg’s leadership.","Is Mark Zuckerberg’s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?","The giant social media company is under the spotlight because a political data firm apparently misused information about more than 50 million Facebook users. Facebook is still facing questions about Russia-linked accounts that had significant reach within the United States through the social network. In both cases, Facebook has struggled to show the public that it can get in front of its problems. Information about the Russia-linked accounts came out piecemeal, and Facebook knew as early as 2015 that the political data firm had violated its data policies.","Mr. Zuckerberg at first downplayed concerns about Facebook’s role in the 2016 presidential election (something he later said he regretted). His recent communications contain more high-minded deliberation than hard discussion of the company’s problems and how to deal with them.","These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.","Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company’s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook’s profitability. Indeed, there’s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg’s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.","In the near term, though, it’s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook’s extraordinary profitability – its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue – will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.","If governments propose restrictions on using members’ data, Facebook’s business model would be tested. The company’s board, in theory, should press Mr. Zuckerberg for details on how he will deal with such shackles. But prominent board members like Marc L. Andreessen and Peter A. Thiel are skeptical of regulation. Facebook might be tempted to fight back.","Lawmakers may hold the line, however, sensing that the public has real concerns about the company. And if Facebook’s responses look tardy and inadequate, the consequences could be harsh, as the fate of Wells Fargo shows. Mr. Zuckerberg, in his uniquely dominant position, is the one person who can make sure this doesn’t happen.","— Peter Eavis","Lawmakers want answers on Facebook’s latest controversy","Lawmakers in the U.S. and Britain want Mark Zuckerberg to explain how Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm founded by Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer, harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.","What happened:The NYT and The Observer of London reported how Cambridge had collected data from an outside researcher to better target Facebook users. Christopher Wylie, who oversaw Cambridge’s data collection until 2014, told the NYT of his former company, “For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","Facebook argued that the incident wasn’t a data breach and that Cambridge had committed a violation. But former Federal Trade Commission officials told the WaPo that Facebook may have violated a privacy pact reached with the regulator. (The tech giant is reviewing whether one of its employees had been aware of the data leak.)","More on Cambridge Analytica: Alexander Nix, the company’s chief, is facing scrutiny over business dealings with Russian interests. Mr. Wylie said that one Russian company, the oil giant Lukoil, appeared more interested in political message targeting than commercial uses. And Cambridge is reportedly trying to block the airing of a report by Channel 4, a British television channel, in which reporters went undercover at the firm.","“Facebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn’t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.”","Photo","A fleet of self-driving Uber cars in 2016.

In an instant, the campaign had a way to see the hidden young voters. Roughly 85% of those without a listed phone number could be found in the uploaded friend lists. What’s more, Facebook offered an ideal way to reach them. ‘People don’t trust campaigns. They don’t even trust media organizations,’ says Goff [Teddy Goff, the Obama campaign’s former digital director]. ‘Who do they trust? Their friends.’”","Davidsen also shared a link to a talk from 2015, in which she recalled how Facebook’s privacy policies in 2012 helped the Obama team win an army of supporters.","“The privacy policies at that time on Facebook were – if they opted in, they could tell us who all their friends were. So, they told us who all their friends were. We were actually able to ingest the entire social network of the US that’s on Facebook, which is most people.”","But that was back then. Now, the more privacy-concerned public have sent the shares of Facebook tumbling following reports in the New York Times and the Observer that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Donald Trump’s 2016 election team, harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook users.","Facebook said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica after finding data privacy policies had been violated.","“Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as ‘surveillance companies,’” the former National Security Agency contractor wrote. “Their rebranding as ‘social media’ is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense,” he added."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

In the wake of the scandal over Facebook's privacy practices, users have become newly interested in the data that Facebook collects and retains about them. But while the social network makes it fairly simple to download everything it knows about you, it doesn't provide a roadmap for how to parse that data or figure out what it means.","Facebook announced Wednesday, however, that in the coming weeks, it will expand the data it allows you to download to include likes, reactions, search history, and location history. The social network also plans to add an option for users to transfer the data to another service if they want. Part of the rollout includes a new tool called Access Your Information, which allows users to more easily view and delete old posts, reactions, comments, and search history.","For now though, your Facebook data is still likely filled of surprises. Over the weekend, some Android users were shocked to learn that Facebook retained metadata about their call and SMS history. That's far from the only interesting piece of information you might find by sorting through your Facebook file. Here's what I found looking through mine, and tips for how to find the most interesting information in yours.","Get the Goods","First, you'll need to download the file of data that Facebook has on you. To do so, go to your Facebook settings. At the bottom of the General tab, you should see an option to Download a copy of your Facebook data_. After opting in, you'll receive two emails, one acknowledging that Facebook received your request, and another that includes the file when it's ready. Depending on how much content you've posted to Facebook—including photos, videos, text posts, and other forms of media—it might take some time for the file to be prepared.","I've been on Facebook for over a decade, and my 277.2 MB file was ready within a half hour. But I also haven't uploaded many photos or videos to the site. Once you have the file, you can download it as a folder to your desktop. Mine was labeled \"facebook-louisematsakis.\"","The first piece of information you will want to look at is a file labeled index.htm. Clicking on this file will open a tab within your browser, with a menu of options on the left-hand side. Under Profile, you'll find a list of basic information the site has about you, like the exact time you signed up for Facebook, the contact information you've provided, as well as any work or education history.","One surprising piece of information on this screen: Facebook keeps a list of everyone you've previously said you were in a relationship with. For me, this includes a bunch of my friends, because back in middle and high school, it was cool to declare you were in a relationship with a close friend. The list only includes three people I've actually dated. The very first person on the list is, inexplicably, my own cousin (being 13 was weird, OK?).","Photos, Videos, and Friends","The Photos tab contains every photo you've ever uploaded to the site, as well as related metadata, like the IP address from which each photo was uploaded. Scroll down, and you'll find a link to the facial recognition data that Facebook retains. If you click it, you can see your Example Count, which could be the number of photos Facebook used to train a machine learning algorithm to recognize your face. My Example Count is 214. Facebook says this figure is \"a unique number based on a comparison of the photos you're tagged in. We use this data to help others tag you in photos.\"","If you want to opt-out of Facebook's facial recognition features, here’s how to do that.","One interesting note about photos: My Facebook data didn’t appear to included tagged photos of me, just photos I had uploaded myself.","The Videos tab contained dozens of clips I posted to my friends' timelines when I was a teenager. It's impressive how much you can forget what you shared over the years; I was horrified to realize that Facebook had so many grainy videos of my face at 13, 14, and 15 years old. Also fun? If you recorded a video on Facebook but never actually posted it, Facebook still has it.","In the Friends tab you'll find every single one of your Facebook friends, as well as the date that you added each other. If you unfriended someone, and then re-added them later, they'll show up on this list twice. The list also includes all of the friend requests that you have declined.","Pay special attention to the very bottom of the page, where you can see what \"Friend Peer Group\" Facebook thinks you're in. Mine says \"Starting Adult Life.\"","Advertising & Other Weird Info","The most interesting part of your index is the Ads tab. There, Facebook will show you a list of ad categories it has associated with your account. Mine include dozens of publications like Harper's and Buzzfeed, as well as vexing ones like \"Goth subculture\" and \"Middle Class.\"","I have certainly poked people on Facebook more times than this.","Below this list you'll find advertisements you've supposedly clicked on; mine has 40, dating back to January. And below that is a distressing list of advertisers Facebook says \"have your contact information.\" (Former Facebook ad executive Antonio García Martínez suggests that this means the advertisers came to Facebook with your information, not the other way around.) They may have brought this information to the social network using Facebook's custom audience tool, according to a Facebook representative. For me, this includes major corporations like Walmart, ASOS, Airbnb, and Marriott Rewards. It also includes a number of bands, the dating app Happn, which I don't recall ever using, and \"House of Blues Dallas.\" I have never been to Dallas.","One data set seems surprisingly incomplete; under Pokes I was inexplicably greeted by only two pokes, one from 2013 and another from last year. I have certainly poked people on Facebook more times than this. It's unclear why Facebook has only chosen to retain these two poking instances, though other users appear to have experienced the same oversight. Facebook didn't answer a request for comment about why it has only kept track of a select list of pokes.","The last thing to check in your index is the Applications tab, which is a list of apps you've used to sign up with using your Facebook profile.","Messages","Aside from the index, your Facebook data file should also include several other folders, labeled html, messages, photos, and videos. Mostly they repeat information that’s also included in the index. Don't skip them altogether though. In Messages > files, for instance, are all the files you've sent over Facebook Messenger, and Messages > photos contains all the images you’ve sent. Mine only appear to date back several years, likely because I used to regularly delete my Facebook messages.","Call & SMS Records","If you have an Android device, you may have given Facebook or Facebook Lite permission to access your call and text history years ago. Specifically, before Google changed how permissions worked in Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, simply allowing Facebook to access your contacts also let it grab your call and message logs.","Find out for sure by clicking the Contact Info tab. Because I've only ever used an iPhone—Apple doesn't allow apps to scrape call and text history—this tab only contained a list of my phone's contacts. If you have granted permission, this screen will also include a certified creepy list of your call and SMS history.","Get Rid of It","Now that you’ve looked through your Facebook data, here’s how to delete some of it. Keep in mind that Facebook says it plans to soon make it easier to delete data, but for now, the process is fairly cumbersome.","The first place to start is your contacts. First, head over to Facebook’s “Manage Invites and Imported Contacts” page. At the bottom of the screen, there’s an option to “Remove all contacts,” though you can also choose to manually remove specific ones. You’ll need to repeat this step for contacts you’ve uploaded through Facebook Messenger, which you can do here. Lastly, you’ll need to prevent Facebook from continuously re-uploading your contacts. You can learn how to turn off that settings here. Again, you’ll need to do it twice, once on the Facebook App and again on Messenger.","Lastly, here’s how to delete individual posts you’ve made to Facebook. Click the top right-hand options tab on desktop, and then click Activity Log. There, you’ll be able to delete any post from your history, and you can jump to specific years if you’d like to delete the oldest stuff first. If you’re interested in bulk deleting, you can use a Chrome extension like Social Book Post Manager.","If you’re not quite ready mass-remove your old posts, but want to limit who can see them, here’s a full guide to updating your Facebook’s privacy settings. Remember, though, that Facebook says it's going to re-vamp its privacy features in coming weeks—which means you get to do this all over again."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Facebook announced it was suspending the company late Friday, saying the measure was in response to the data firm improperly storing the user data of 270,000 people for years after promising to delete it. On Saturday, however, sources cited by The New York Times said the suspension went far beyond simple policy violations, with the data firm accused of stealing the personal information of at least 50 million Facebook users with the goal of influencing elections. The personal data was reportedly obtained under the guise of a personality-prediction app by Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan, who is accused of conspiring with Cambridge Analytica to unlawfully glean users' information and build psychological profiles. The data analysis company has faced increasing scrutiny in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe for its work with President Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","Facebook has also come under fire for its role in allowing Russian ads to flourish during the election, and some questioned why the social media giant took so long to take action against Cambridge Analytica. Sen. Mark Warner told The Daily Beast the latest accusations are “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West.” “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}
{"originalurl":"https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/17/obama-digital-data-machine-facebook-election","title":"Obama, Facebook and the power of friendship: the 2012 data election | US news | The Guardian","text":["Barack Obama's re-election team are building a vast digital data operation that for the first time combines a unified database on millions of Americans with the power of Facebook to target individual voters to a degree never achieved before.","Digital analysts predict this will be the first election cycle in which Facebook could become a dominant political force. The social media giant has grown exponentially since the last presidential election, rendering it for the first time a major campaigning tool that has the potential to transform friendship into a political weapon.","Facebook is also being seen as a source of invaluable data on voters. The re-election team, Obama for America, will be inviting its supporters to log on to the campaign website via Facebook, thus allowing the campaign to access their personal data and add it to the central data store – the largest, most detailed and potentially most powerful in the history of political campaigns. If 2008 was all about social media, 2012 is destined to become the \"data election\".","\"Facebook is now ubiquitous,\" says Dan Siroker, a former Google digital analyst who joined Obama's campaign in 2008 and now runs his own San Francisco-based analytics consultancy, Optimizely. \"Whichever candidate uses Facebook the most effectively could win the war.\"","For the past nine months a crack team of some of America's top data wonks has occupied an entire floor of the Prudential building in Chicago devising a digital campaign from the bottom up. The team draws much of its style and inspiration from the corporate sector, with its driving ambition to create a vote-garnering machine that is smooth, unobtrusive and ruthlessly efficient.","Already more than 100 geeks, some recruited at top-flight university job fairs including Stanford, are assembled in the Prudential drawn from an array of disciplines: statisticians, predictive modellers, data mining experts, mathematicians, software engineers, bloggers, internet advertising experts and online organisers.","At the core is a single beating heart – a unified computer database that gathers and refines information on millions of committed and potential Obama voters. The database will allow staff and volunteers at all levels of the campaign – from the top strategists answering directly to Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina to the lowliest canvasser on the doorsteps of Ohio – to unlock knowledge about individual voters and use it to target personalised messages that they hope will mobilise voters where it counts most.","Every time an individual volunteers to help out – for instance by offering to host a fundraising party for the president – he or she will be asked to log onto the re-election website with their Facebook credentials. That in turn will engage Facebook Connect, the digital interface that shares a user's personal information with a third party.","Consciously or otherwise, the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they store publicly on their Facebook page – home location, date of birth, interests and, crucially, network of friends – directly into the central Obama database.","\"If you log in with Facebook, now the campaign has connected you with all your relationships,\" a digital campaign organiser who has worked on behalf of Obama says.","The potential benefits of the strategy can already be felt. The Obama campaign this year has attracted about 1.3 million donors, 98% of whom have contributed $250 or less – that's more than double the number at the same stage in 2008. At this rate, Obama is also well on the way towards staging the world's first billion-dollar campaign.","Under its motto \"Bigger, better, 2012\", the Chicago team intends between now and election day in November to create a campaign powerhouse which will allow fundraisers, advertisers and state and local organisers to draw from the same data source.","Joe Rospars, the campaign's chief digital strategist, told a seminar at the Guardian-sponsored Social Media Week that the aim was to create technology that encourages voters to get involved, in tune with Obama's emphasis on community organising.","Campaign insiders say that the emphasis this year will be on efficiency more than any headline-grabbing technical wizardry. But that should not obscure how significant this year's presidential cycle will be in putting to the test the first custom-made digital campaign.","Mark Sullivan, founder of Voter Activation Network, which manages the Democratic party's central database of voter information known as Vote Builder, says that \"what we will see in 2012 will make 2008 look really primitive\".","Judith Freeman of New Organizing Institute, who worked on both John Kerry's 2004 and Obama's 2008 presidential campaigns, says there is a leap forward in technology every presidential cycle, and 2012 would be no exception. \"There's a deadline – it's got to be done by election day – and that provides a huge push to make things happen.\"","In 2008 the Obama digital team was lauded around the world for its groundbreaking work on internet fundraising. Yet in fact, the separation of its data on voters into several distinct silos forced high-level staffers to spend hours manually downloading information from one database to another.","The Obama team in 2008 did a good job in beginning to tear down those walls, releasing extraordinary fundraising energy in the process that raised about $500m online.","This year the Chicago team hasn't knocked down the walls so much as dispensed with them altogether. They have built from the ground up a unified database that incorporates and connects everything the campaign knows about a voter within it.","Rospars said that in 2012 they no longer had to try to integrate data in the campaign. \"We are just one campaign now – we built it from scratch.\"","The centralised nature of the database may raise privacy issues as the election cycle progresses. Jeff Chester of the digital advertising watchdog Center for Digital Democracy, which has been calling for regulators to review the growth of digital marketing in politics, said that \"this is beyond J Edgar Hoover's dream. In its rush to exploit the power of digital data to win re-election, the Obama campaign appears to be ignoring the ethical and moral implications.\"","But from the vantage point of the campaign the benefits are evident.","\"Fusing your data into one central store is cheaper, quicker and allows you to be more targeted,\" said Jim Pugh, who was part of Obama's 2008 digital team and now works for the progressive online movement, Rebuild the Dream.","The Obama database incorporates Vote Builder, a store of essential information such as age, postal address, occupation and voting history drawn from the voter files of 190 million active voters. It lines up and matches those voter files with data gathered from online interactions with the president's supporters – notably the millions of pieces of information its army of canvassers collected across the nation during the 2008 race, a list of email addresses of supporters that it has amassed and that now stands at about 23 million, as well as the contact information of Obama's 25 million Facebook fans.","Facebook itself has been transformed as a political campaign tool since 2008, simply by dint of its exponential growth. Four years ago there were about 40 million Facebook users in the US; now there are more than 160 million – incorporating almost the entire voting public.","The significance of the fusion of Facebook and voter file data is hard to overemphasise. \"This is the Moneyball moment for politics,\" says Sam Graham-Felsen, Obama's chief blogger in 2008. \"If you can figure out how to leverage the power of friendship, that opens up incredible possibilities.\"","First among those possibilities is that the campaign can distribute customised content designed specifically for its Facebook fans to share with their much wider circle of friends. The messages can be honed to a particular demographic – age, gender, etc – as well as set of interests, and targeted on the most hotly contested parts of the most crucial battleground states.","\"Influencers\" – those people who tend to act as thought leaders among their friends on Facebook – can be identified and prioritised.","Teddy Goff, the digital director of the re-election team, told Social Media Week that as the year progresses there would be more and more \"persuasion through interaction\".","Individual voters would be given access to digital platforms from which they will be able to tell their own stories \"and that's far more powerful than anything we can say\", Goff said. \"That will be the story of this election. People's own stories really moves votes.\"","Goff said the campaign was focused on building relationships through social media. An Obama message would be crafted so that \"not only can it be passed to your friends but to those friends that we think are most in need of passing it on to\".","The bottom line is that if you are sent a message from your Facebook friend encouraging you to turn up to an event or donate to Obama, you are vastly more likely to respond than if the request comes from an anonymous campaign staffer.","The other door that data integration will further open in 2012 is personalised marketing. This has been the Holy Grail of political campaigners for decades: the idea that you can talk directly to voters and serve them customised messages.","In the old world of snail mail, that could be achieved to some degree through direct marketing – ie leaflets dropped into the letter box – but that is expensive and far too slow with today's 24-hour news cycle.","The fusion of information into a centralised database allows you to direct market online at much less cost and virtually instantaneously.","The technique has begun to spread widely among commercial businesses over the past year, and it is only a matter of time before such hyper-targeting is standard across political campaigns. Indeed, we've already started to see it this year.","The Obama campaign has already tailored a single donation request to 26 distinct segments of the voting public. The Republicans are also getting in on the act.","Michele Bachmann used customised online advertising in Iowa to reach Republican voters only, sending to their computers messages with a local spin for each of the state's 99 counties. That helped her win Iowa's vaunted straw poll in August 2011 (though that didn't help her in the long run). Rick Perry sent God-praising commercials to Iowans who listed themselves as evangelicals on Facebook.","The company CampaignGrid, that serves mainly Republican candidates, claims to be able to online market direct to targeted households. It has an integrated database on 110 million voters across America – some 65% of the electorate – to whom it can serve personalised ads, following them wherever they are browsing on the internet.","Jeff Dittus, the company's co-founder, illustrates what this means. He worked on behalf of one unidentified Republican presidential candidate, serving online ads in the Miami-Dade region of Florida specifically to 400,000 individuals who had voted in at least two of the four previous Republican primaries. The adverts were further customised for gender, and for Spanish speaking.","They were distributed to the individuals through internet ad exchanges that allow for instantaneous filtering of users the nanosecond they click onto a video on any one of four million websites. In that flash, if you fitted the criterion you were served with a 30-second pre-roll video from the candidate delivering a message to you that you would have found remarkably personal.","\"I'm sure this is the future of digital political campaigning,\" said CampaignGrid's CEO Jeff Dittus.","Drew Brighton, CEO of TargetSmart Communications, is hoping to do the same hyper-targeting for Democratic and progressive politicians and causes through his new product Target Blue. It matches up the details of up to 50m cookies embedded on individual computers with voter files and uses it to identify Democratic-leaning individuals to whom it can serve customised ads wherever they go on the web.","The company is also developing a system for targeting Democratic voters through their computer IP addresses down to such tightly drawn areas or \"IP zones\" as just 20 households. That allows for micro-targeting depending on the average income bracket, age profile and concerns of that tiny locality.","The elephant in the room, of course, is television, which continues to dominate advertising spending by political campaigns. Most analysts agree that 2012 has come too soon for any equally transformative leaps forward in targeted or \"addressable\" TV advertising.","Cable television can close in on geographic zones ranging from a few thousand to up to 100,000 viewers allowing campaigns to shape their messages to those clusters. The tighter the geographical area that can be drawn, the more efficient the TV advertising becomes as campaign managers can focus on primarily-Democratic, Republican or independent neighbourhoods.","But its still a relatively blunt instrument. The prize would be to be able to fuse cable subscriptions with voter files so that TV adverts could be sent to households of a specific political persuasion.","Technically, that's already possible. Comcast Spotlight, the advertising arm of Comcast Cable, has run trials of commercial as opposed to political addressable advertising in Baltimore. Adverts custom-made to speak to various demographic groups were piped into 60,000 identified households, though the personal details were removed to protect privacy. The results confirmed the power of the technology: homes receiving addressable adverts tuned away a third less of the time than homes receiving untargeted commercials.","Dan Sinagoga, who specialises in political advertising at Comcast Spotlight, says that all advertisers, but political ones in particular, \"would like to be doing addressable advertising yesterday\". But he said it was unlikely to happen in any great quantity in 2012 as there are too many hurdles, including concerns in Washington about the privacy of cable TV consumers.","No such impediment will hold back the digital explosion this year. As an Obama insider puts it: \"Give us less wood, and we'll make more fire.\""],"isopubdate":"2012-02-17"}
{"originalurl":"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/technology/social-media-privacy.html","title":"Can Social Media Be Saved? - The New York Times","text":["Can Social Media Be Saved?","You’ve probably experienced it yourself. Maybe it’s the way you feel while scrolling through your Twitter feed — anxious, twitchy, a little world weary — or your unease when you see a child watching YouTube videos, knowing she’s just a few algorithmic nudges away from a rabbit hole filled with lunatic conspiracies and gore. Or maybe it was this month’s Facebook privacy scandal, which reminded you that you’ve entrusted the most intimate parts of your digital life to a profit-maximizing surveillance machine.","Our growing discomfort with our largest social platforms is reflected in polls. One recently conducted by Axios and SurveyMonkey found that all three of the major social media companies — Facebook, Twitter and Google, which shares a parent company with YouTube — are significantly less popular with Americans than they were five months ago. (And Americans might be the lucky ones. Outside the United States, social media is fueling real-world violence and empowering autocrats, often with much less oversight.)","But it would be a mistake to throw up our hands and assume that it has to be this way. The original dream of social media — producing healthy discussions, unlocking new forms of creativity, connecting people to others with similar interests — shouldn’t be discarded because of the failures of the current market leaders. And lots of important things still happen on even the most flawed networks. The West Virginia teachers’ strike and last weekend’s March for Our Lives, for example, were largely organized on Facebook and Twitter.","The primary problem with today’s social networks is that they’re already too big, and are trapped inside a market-based system that forces them to keep growing. Facebook can’t stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks can’t stop selling coffee — it’s the heart of the enterprise.","Many of the fixes being proposed involve regulation. The Honest Ads Act, a bill in the Senate, would require greater transparency for online political ads. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, aims to give users greater control of their digital information trails.","But these efforts don’t touch the underlying problems, and in fact could make it harder for start-ups to compete with the giants.","If we’re really serious about changing how social networks operate, far more radical interventions are required. Here are three possible ways to rescue social media from the market-based pressures that got us here.","Give Power to the People","In their book “New Power,” which comes out next week, Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms write about the struggle between centralized, top-down institutions, which represent “old power,” and decentralized, bottom-up movements, which represent “new power.”","Facebook, they write, is an example of a new power institution that serves old power interests. It harvests the creative output of billions of people and turns it into a giant, centralized enterprise, with most users sharing none of the economic value they create and getting no say in the platform’s governance.","Instead, the authors ask, what if a social network was truly run by its users?","“If you’re contributing economic value to something of this much social consequence, you should share in the value you’re creating,” Mr. Heimans told me.","Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado, had a similar idea in 2016, when he proposed that Twitter users band together to buy the platform from its shareholders and convert it into a user-run collective, similar to the way a local credit union is run. People who made valuable contributions to the network, such as employees and power users, would receive bigger stakes and more voting power. And users would have a seat at the table for major decisions about the platform’s operations.","It’s exceedingly unlikely that Mark Zuckerberg, who has fought hard to keep control of Facebook, will ever convert the company into a user-owned and run collective. But Mr. Schneider believes that giving more control to responsible users could help restore trust in the network, and signal the kind of values Mr. Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to represent.","“He could show that he takes democracy seriously enough to start with his own baby,” Mr. Schneider said.","Create a Social Federation","Another radical approach would be to make social networks work more like email — so that independent apps could seamlessly work together with one another, across a common protocol.","Instead of one big Facebook, a federated social network would look like clusters of independent nodes — Mombook and Athletebook and Gamerbook — all of which could be plugged into the umbrella network when it made sense. Rather than requiring a one-size-fits-all set of policies that apply to billions of users, these nodes could be designed to reflect users’ priorities. (A network for privacy hawks and one for open-sharing maximalists could have different data-retention rules, and a network for L.G.B.T. users and one for evangelical pastors could have different hate speech rules.) If a node became too toxic, it could be removed without shutting down the entire network.","“Email is the most resilient social network on the internet,” Mr. Schneider said, “and the thing that allows it to adapt is that it’s an open protocol, and people build apps on top of it, and we evolve how we use it.”","Versions of this kind of network already exist. Mastodon, a decentralized Twitter-like social network, has gotten more than a million registered users since its debut in 2016. And various social networks based on the blockchain — the ledger system that underlies virtual currencies like Bitcoin — have sprung up in recent months.","To be sure, decentralized networks have their own problems. They’re messy to administer, and they can still be gamed by bad actors. They can also fall prey to the same kind of privacy issues that Facebook is being criticized for. (In fact, part of the reason users are angry at Facebook right now is that the company’s data infrastructure was too open, and made it overly simple for third-party app developers to take user information outside Facebook.)","None of this is a panacea. But experimenting with more decentralized models could give social media users a sense that platforms represented their interests, rather than those of a faceless corporation.","Put Expiration Dates on Social Graphs","A single friend of mine once remarked that the major difference among dating apps like OKCupid, Tinder and Bumble wasn’t the way they were designed or the companies behind them — it was how long they had existed.","New apps, she said, were more likely to attract interesting and smart people who were actually looking for dates. Older apps, by contrast, were eventually overrun with creeps and predators, no matter how well built they were.","A similar theory might apply to social networks. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat all had plenty of issues in their early years, but they were by and large cleaner, with fewer types of exploitation and malicious behavior. Today, the enormous size and influence of these platforms have made them irresistible honey pots for bad actors, and many of our “social graphs” — Facebook’s term for the webs of digital connections we create — are clogged with years’ worth of clutter.","In a blog post last year, the venture capitalist Hunter Walk proposed an interesting idea: a legally mandated “start over” button that, when pressed, would allow users of social networks to delete all their data, clear out their feeds and friend lists, and begin with a fresh account.","I’d go even further, and suggest that social networks give their users an automatic “self-cleaning” option, which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used, friendships and followers they no longer interacted with, and data they no longer needed to store. If these tools were enabled, users would need to take affirmative action if they didn’t want their information to disappear after a certain number of months or years.","Making social graphs temporary, rather than preserving them forever by default, would undoubtedly be bad for most social networks’ business models. But it could create new and healthy norms around privacy and data hygiene, and it would keep problems from piling up as networks get older and more crowded. It might even recapture some of the magic of the original social networks, when things were fresh and fascinating, and not quite so scary.","Correction:","An earlier version of this article misstated the number of registered users on Mastodon. It is more than a million, not more than 140,000."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of their Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a huge data pool. Facebook’s policy only allows for the collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app – prohibiting it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook has announced that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company SCL Group have been suspended from the platform for what Facebook says was an inability to delete data that had been collected from users.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook,” the company said in a statement by Paul Grewal, VP & Deputy General Counsel.","The statement went on to explain that Aleksandr Kogan was granted access to information from more than a quarter of a million users after they downloaded ‘thisisyourdigitallife’. These users gave consent for Kogan to access certain information about them and their friends, which he subsequently shared with Cambridge Analytica and other third parties.","“Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” continued the statement.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies.","“When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.","“If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Facebook has also strongly denied that the incident constitutes a breach of user data.","“The claim that this is a data breach is completely false,” said the statement. “Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign.

The ubiquitous social media giant apparently doesn’t take user rejection lightly, and despite its string of bad behavior, it isn’t about to let you ― or your personal data ― go without a struggle.","The latest accusation that Facebook misbehaved came over the weekend, when U.S. and British lawmakers demanded to know why the site didn’t warn 50 million of its users that a political data firm with links to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign had harvested their private information for something called a “psychographic voter model.”","Even aside from fears that data could wind up in the wrong places, some users have just reached their saturation point for cat videos and lunch photos. They would like to bid adieu, but Facebook makes it hard. So what’s a Facebook user to do if they’ve had enough?","Facebook likes to hang on to its users, says Serge Egelman, research director of the Berkeley Laboratory for Usable and Experimental Security, a company affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley, that researches how people make privacy and security decisions, and then uses that understanding to construct safer systems and interfaces.","The real business of Facebook is collecting data, Egelman says, and for years now, the site has made it hard for users to delete theirs ― not that the internet allows erasures anyway. Once you post something, it is out there, somewhere, forever more. Until 2007, Facebook never completely deleted a user’s information even if their account was deleted. It was more like suspending an account, which meant a person could get their account and all the information back anytime they decided to join Facebook again. In 2008, Facebook began offering the option of permanent deletion.","Facebook isn’t interested in giving away your data when it can make money off it.","Today, Facebook basically offers its users two divorce options: deactivation, which leaves room for a user to come back with all their data intact (and makes that data available to Facebook even if the user doesn’t return); and deletion, which permanently removes a user’s data from Facebook but requires that the user contact Facebook and engage in a multi-step and time-consuming process for that to happen. After jumping through multiple online hoops, those wishing to delete their account must wait about two weeks for the deletion to be processed. If you sign on to an account during this waiting period, the deletion process will be terminated and you have to start all over again.","There is a third option, of course, which is to just do nothing ― you abandon your account and stop signing on to Facebook ― which Egelman and others think happens quite a bit.","Facebook did not respond to HuffPost’s request for statistics about how many users have deleted, deactivated or abandoned their Facebook accounts.","Egelman said that the “right to be forgotten” exists in the European Union, but not in the United States. “The U.S. needs more stringent policy directives so that we have the right to be forgotten and have our data delivered,” he told HuffPost.","But to keep things in perspective, he said, you should determine your “threat model,” meaning what you’re actually worried will happen.","Is it that some stranger will be able to learn where you live and what your kids’ names are from Facebook? Certainly there is the risk that collecting information from multiple online sources ― Facebook being just one ― could lead to a bigger compilation of information about you, your health conditions, your finances, etc.","The reality is that most of this data is being collected by companies that want to target the ads they send your way. While it’s annoying to think someone is tracking you, the goal is nothing more nefarious than identifying consumers for a product. Period. Which is not to discount those who would steal your identity, clean out your savings account or break into your house after learning you are in Hawaii from those vacation photos you posted on Facebook.","Short of deleting your account, what can an individual user do to limit where your Facebook data winds up? Here are a few cautions:","1. Don’t use Facebook to sign on to other apps.","Sure, it’s more convenient to use Facebook to sign on to other apps, because who can remember a gazillion passwords for all those different sites? But when you do it, you are giving the other app permission to access your information on Facebook. And who knows what they, as third-party sites, will do with it?","2. Remember that the weakest link is anyone connected to you.","OK, so let’s say you have wisely heeded the advice to only friend people on Facebook who you actually know in real life. You can even make it more selective: just family for family news or just school friends for school news.","When you open the Facebook door to strangers, you are handing over the keys to your data. Ditto for posting your updates so that they can be seen by friends of friends or the public.","People frequently add their work colleagues to their friends list. This can get dicey should you complain about someone in the office or add an inappropriate photo. Maybe “Don’t Facebook Under the Influence” should be a bumper sticker?","3. Don’t let others post to your timeline.","Do you really want the lout from your college fraternity to be sharing remembrances, like the time you both woke up in the trash dumpster? “Good times, man, good times.” Your prospective employer may not agree.","College admissions officers, future employers, even future spouses ― are all going to check you out online. At least control the narrative of your own timeline and keep frat boys and others who could unwittingly harm you away.","In the same vein, your health history probably doesn’t need to be posted publicly.","4. Share defensively.","Even the most innocuous post can play into the hands of identity thieves. You know how much you love getting all those happy birthday wishes on Facebook? Get over it. Your birthdate is a vital link in the verification of your identity. Facebook’s feature of remembering your birthday and notifying all your friends is sweet ― and dangerous.","There is also really no reason to post to Facebook with the location tagger working. Facebook places lets your friends know where you are and what you are doing. What’s more, you will be spammed by others’ updates on their whereabouts, which can be very disturbing. So if you want to have your coffee in peace, make sure that your Facebook privacy settings are as per your requirements.","5. Like less, worry more.","We all get a ton of requests to like something on Facebook ― a group, a post, a movie, book or place. Tons of them. Those likes are what help shape our data profile.","Be mindful of what you say on all social media sites, including Facebook. Enjoy the site for what it gives us ― the ability to stay in touch and share life’s moments with people we know ― but watch what you post carefully."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.","Cambridge has been largely funded by Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to the president who became an early board member and gave the firm its name. It has pitched its services to potential clients ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.","What kind of information was collected, and how was it acquired?","The data, a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook, and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads.","Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app, which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned.","The technique had been developed at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Center. The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing.","Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica.","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use.","Facebook said no passwords or “sensitive pieces of information” had been taken, though information about a user’s location was available to Cambridge.","So was Facebook hacked?","Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was not a data breach, because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes — and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account.","But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred “to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.” It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm.","Dr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","Cambridge Analytica officials, after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data, changed their story last week. In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","But the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","What is Facebook doing in response?","The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan’s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan’s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed.","Facebook also said: “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","In a further step, Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm “to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists.” It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr. Kogan had given a verbal commitment, while Mr. Wylie “thus far has declined.”","What are others saying?","Facebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica. Investors have not been pleased, sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday.","■ In Congress, Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have asked to hold a hearing on Facebook’s links to Cambridge Analytica. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, led by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected.","■ A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebook’s ties to Cambridge Analytica.","■ The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

{"originalurl":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-downward-spiral","title":"“This Is Serious”: Facebook Begins Its Downward Spiral | Vanity Fair","text":["Facebook","“This Is Serious”: Facebook Begins Its Downward Spiral","Facebook was always famous for the sign that hung in its offices, written in big red type on a white background, that said “Move Fast and Break Things.” Every time I think about the company, I realize it has done just that—to itself.","Years ago, long before Mark Zuckerberg became Mark Zuckerberg, the young founder reached out to a friend of mine who had also started a company, albeit a considerably smaller one, in the social-media space, and suggested they get together. As Facebook has grown into a global colossus that connects about a third of the globe, Zuckerberg has subsequently assumed a reputation as an aloof megalomaniac deeply out of touch with the people who use his product. But back then, when he only had 100 million users on his platform, he wasn’t perceived that way. When he reached out to my friend, Zuckerberg was solicitous. He made overtures that suggested a possible acquisition—and once rebuffed, returned with the notion that perhaps Facebook could at least partner with my friend’s company. The chief of the little start-up was excited by the seemingly harmless, even humble, proposition from the growing hegemon. Zuckerberg suggested that the two guys take a walk.","Taking a walk, it should be noted, was Zuckerberg’s thing. He regularly took potential recruits and acquisition targets on long walks in the nearby woods to try to convince them to join his company. After the walk with my friend, Zuckerberg appeared to take the relationship to the next level. He initiated a series of conference calls with his underlings in Facebook’s product group. My friend’s small start-up shared their product road map with Facebook’s business-development team. It all seemed very collegial, and really exciting. And then, after some weeks passed, the C.E.O. of the little start-up saw the news break that Facebook had just launched a new product that competed with his own.","Stories about Facebook’s ruthlessness are legend in Silicon Valley, New York, and Hollywood. The company has behaved as bullies often do when they are vying for global dominance—slurping the lifeblood out of its competitors (as it did most recently with Snap, after C.E.O. Evan Spiegel also rebuffed Zuckerberg’s acquisition attempt), blatantly copying key features (as it did with Snapchat’s Stories), taking ideas (remember those Winklevoss twins?), and poaching senior executives (Facebook is crawling with former Twitter, Google, and Apple personnel). Zuckerberg may look aloof, but there are stories of him giving rousing Braveheart-esque speeches to employees, sometimes in Latin. Twitter, Snap, and Foursquare have all been marooned, at various points, because of Facebook’s implacable desire to grow. Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus VR, and dozens of others are breathing life because they assented to Facebook’s acquisition desires. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg moved quickly to circumnavigate regulations before governments realized the problems that Facebook created—and certainly before they understood exactly how dangerous a social network can be to their citizens’ privacy, and to a democracy as a whole.","From a business standpoint, Facebook’s barbarism seemed to work out well for the company. The social network is worth over half-a-trillion dollars, and Zuckerberg himself is worth some $76 billion. Facebook has some of the smartest engineers and executives in the entire industry. But the fallout from that success has also become increasingly obvious, especially since the 2016 election, which prompted a year of public relations battles over the company’s most fundamental problems. And now, as we enter 2018, Zuckerberg is finally owning up to it: Facebook is in real trouble.","During the past six months alone, countless executives who once worked for the company are publicly articulating the perils of social media on both their families and democracy. Chamath Palihapitiya, an early executive, said social networks “are destroying how society works”; Sean Parker, its founding president, said “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” (Just this weekend, Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, said he won’t let his nephew on social media.) Over the past year, people I have spoken to internally at the company have voiced concerns for what Facebook is doing (or most recently, has done) to society. Many begin the conversation by rattling off a long list of great things that Facebook inarguably does for the world—bring people and communities together, help people organize around like-minded positive events—but, as if in slow motion, those same people recount the negatives. Unable to hide from the reality of what social media has wrought, Facebook has been left with no choice but to engage with people and the media to explore if it is possible to fix these problems. Zuckerberg determined that his 2018 annual challenge would be fixing his own Web site, noting that “the world feels anxious and divided,” and that Facebook might—just maybe—be contributing to that. “My personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues,” he wrote. Now, the company has said it’s going to change the focus of the site to be less about news and more about human connections.","The question, of course, revolves around this underlying motivation. Is Zuckerberg saying this because he really does worry what the world might look like tomorrow if we continue headed in the direction we’re going? Is Facebook eliminating news from its site because it realizes that spotting “fake news” is too difficult to solve—even for Facebook? Or, as some people have posited to me, is Facebook rethinking the divide it has created in order to keep growing? After all, much of Zuckerberg’s remaining growth opportunity centers upon China, and the People’s Republic won’t let any product (digital or otherwise) enter its borders if there’s a chance it could disrupt the government’s control. Why would the Chinese Politburo open its doors to a force that could conspire in its own Trumpification or Brexit or similar populist unrest?","There’s another theory floating around as to why Facebook cares so much about the way it’s impacting the world, and it’s one that I happen to agree with. When Zuckerberg looks into his big-data crystal ball, he can see a troublesome trend occurring. A few years ago, for example, there wasn’t a single person I knew who didn’t have Facebook on their smartphone. These days, it’s the opposite. This is largely anecdotal, but almost everyone I know has deleted at least one social app from their devices. And Facebook is almost always the first to go. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and other sneaky privacy-piercing applications are being removed by people who simply feel icky about what these platforms are doing to them, and to society.","Some people are terrified that these services are listening in to their private conversations. (The company’s anti-privacy tentacles go so far as to track the dust on your phone to see who you might be spending time with.) Others are sick of getting into an argument with a long-lost cousin, or that guy from high school who still works in the same coffee shop, over something that Trump said, or a “news” article that is full of more bias and false facts. And then there’s the main reason I think people are abandoning these platforms: Facebook knows us better than we know ourselves, with its algorithms that can predict if we’re going to cheat on our spouse, start looking for a new job, or buy a new water bottle on Amazon in a few weeks. It knows how to send us the exact right number of pop-ups to get our endorphins going, or not show us how many Likes we really have to set off our insecurities. As a society, we feel like we’re at war with a computer algorithm, and the only winning move is not to play.","There was a time when Facebook made us feel good about using the service—I used to love it. It was fun to connect with old friends, share pictures of your vacation with everyone, or show off a video of your nephew being extra-specially cute. But, over time, Facebook has had to make Wall Street happy, and the only way to feed that beast is to accumulate more, more, more: more clicks, more time spent on the site, more Likes, more people, more connections, more hyper-personalized ads. All of which adds up to more money. But as one recent mea culpa by an early Internet guru aptly noted, “What if we were never meant to be a global species?”","If Facebook doesn’t solve these problems, and I’m not sure If it actually can, the outcomes could be devastating for the company. As Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School and former senior adviser to the Federal Trade Commission, told me recently, Facebook is in real potential trouble of running into regulatory hazards, either at home or abroad. Whether it’s over hate speech or privacy protections, governments all around the world are exploring how to stop social sites, specifically Facebook, from enabling more harm to spread through society. Wu predicts that if the U.S. government turns its sights on Facebook, it could quiet easily break it up, where Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook are run by four different people. Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at N.Y.U. Stern School of Business, echoed this sentiment in a separate interview with me last year, where he predicted that out of the five big tech companies (Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook), Facebook is the most at risk of seeing a legal hammer come crashing down on its platform. “This is serious. Either it’s this government, or the European government, but this is going to get real,” Galloway told me.","It’s impossible to predict where Facebook and other social sites will be in five years. Will they be largely extinct? Will they be more akin to Netflix, or like TV channels we can group-comment on? Will they have fixed their problems and be thriving? Just a couple years ago, most people believed Twitter was dead on arrival, and then Donald Trump came along and made it his 24-hour mouthpiece. Facebook could go in this direction, saved by its foray into scripted content, or the mass adoption of virtual reality. Or, it could be split up into half-a-dozen pieces.","But one thing is certain. For years, Zuckerberg and Facebook have tromped through the technology landscape and demolished everything that stood in the way. This was done without any reprisal, without any consequence. In fact, each time the company destroyed a competitor, or found a way around traditional regulatory concerns, the valuation of Facebook would go up. But now, it seems that all of those actions are coming back to haunt the company, and social media as a whole. Facebook was always famous for the sign that hung in its offices, written in big red type on a white background, that said “Move Fast and Break Things.” And every time I think about the company, I realize it has done just that—to itself. But I think that Zuckerberg, and the people who work at Facebook, also realize that the things they have broken are things that are going to be very difficult to put back together."],"isopubdate":"2018-01-23"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","The New York Times is reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebook’s official post.\n“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” the added language argued.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.\n— Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) March 17, 2018","While the language is up for debate, lawmakers don’t appear to be looking kindly on Facebook’s arguably legitimate effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)\nWhile most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I’ve called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.\n— Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) March 17, 2018","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”\n“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”\nThat call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.\nOn Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”\n“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”\nJust what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Furthermore, if I were to ask you if your company is data-driven, there's a high probability that you'd say yes — despite substantial industry exaggeration. This is because the industry is only now beginning to put specific parameters around what it means to truly be data-driven versus, say, data-influenced or data-aware.","Many companies confuse the art of data collection with the disciplined science of data analytics. Having access to siloed reporting structures from Facebook, Google and your various marketing, sales and CRM platforms is not the same thing as being able to intelligently answer a question — backed up by data — about your customers and their buyer journeys.","Time is money, and your data speed provides a competitive advantage.","The vast majority of big data is unstructured, which means there's a fair amount of data wrangling involved before you can analyze, build a hypothesis and test your understanding of what the data is telling you. Even with the help of artificial intelligence, there are often time-consuming steps required to break down the data silos to deliver meaningful and actionable insights from your data.","What's worse, the larger the company (in terms of the number of employees), the deeper the silos tend to run. The social media team, for example, tends to myopically obsess over social media success metrics without having a deeper understanding of how their efforts fit into the overall customer journey from initial discovery to repeat purchase behavior.","This is why so many companies authentically believe they are data-driven, yet most are just beginning to fully comprehend what data is truly meaningful, how to navigate through all of it and, most importantly, how quickly they can act upon the insights once they are discovered.","Understand the digital analytics value chain.","A deeper understanding of your customer behavior is usually the most important insight. As business leaders, we tend to focus on metrics such as bounce rates and conversion metrics, but how do these metrics actually translate into truly understanding our customers? Over the past decade, we've gotten really good at reporting the actions our customers take, but by and large, we're still pretty far from truly understanding our customers and their needs.","The goal of any analytics solution is not to track customers. The goal of data analytics is to understand the needs of our ideal customers and to begin applying our learning as we deepen our relationships with them.","State your hypothesis and allow the data to prove or disprove it.","Truly data-driven companies begin by analyzing the data they have and then come up with a well-defined hypothesis that they can prove or disprove with the available data. This is why speed to insights must drive your data analytics in 2018. The faster you can prove or disprove your hypothesis with data, the sooner you will be confident in your understanding of your customers' needs. Having a clear picture of your customers allows you to deliver more relevant marketing campaigns because you can deliver the right message at the right time on the right media platform. The act of experimentation allows you to better understand the needs of your customers and having the right data will support your hypothesis about their needs — or challenge you to dig deeper.","This approach also has the added benefit of helping you to understand the motivations of your customers. By shifting away from an obsession with clicks and bounce rates, you can begin to see the bigger picture of what's really going on with your customers and how you can continue to improve in order to serve them better.","Understand your digital analytics transformation journey.","I'm on a mission to help more companies become data confident as we all go through our own digital analytics transformation journey. Do you know how many analytics tags you currently have on your website? If so, do you know what each one of them does (and if they are even necessary anymore)? Do you have a solid picture of where you are and where you are headed in your company's digital analytics transformation journey? And are you aware of your company's data blind spots and how to ensure the data you are analyzing is, in fact, the whole story?","My hope is that these tips will help you find the answers to these and many more questions as you play a pivotal role and lead your company through its own digital analytics transformation journey."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-13"}

Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign.

Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Readers with long memories will recall him as the guy who ran the “White House Plumbers” during the presidency of Richard Nixon. Liddy directed the Watergate burglary in June 1972, detection of which started the long chain of events that eventually led to Nixon’s resignation two years later. For his pains, Liddy spent more than four years in jail, but went on to build a second career as a talk-show host and D-list celebrity. Reflecting on this, one wonders what job opportunities – other than those of pantomime villain and Savile Row mannequin – will now be available to Mr Nix.","The investigations into the company by Carole Cadwalladr, in the Observer, reveal that in every respect save one important one, CA looks like a standard-issue psychological warfare outfit of the kind retained by political parties – and sometimes national security services – since time immemorial. It did, however, have one unique selling proposition, namely its ability to offer “psychographic” services: voter-targeting strategies allegedly derived by analysing the personal data of more than 50 million US users of Facebook.","The story of how those data made the journey from Facebook’s servers to Cambridge Analytica’s is now widely known. But it is also widely misunderstood. (Many people were puzzled, for example, by Facebook’s vehement insistence that the exfiltration of a huge trove of users’ data was not a “breach”.) The shorthand version of what happened – that “a slug of Facebook data on 50 million Americans was sucked down by a UK academic named Aleksandr Kogan, and wrongly sold to Cambridge Analytica” – misses an important point, which is that in acquiring the data in the first place Kogan was acting with Facebook’s full knowledge and approval.","In 2013, he wrote an app called “Thisisyourdigitallife” which offered users an online personality test, describing itself as “a research app used by psychologists”. Approximately 270,000 people downloaded it and in doing so gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it. This drew more than 50 million unsuspecting Facebook users into Kogan’s net.","Profile","Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica","Nix worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCL’s projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary – featuring on Wired’s list of “25 Geniuses who are creating the future of business” – and derided as a snake oil salesman.","Controversies","Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its role in elections on both sides of the Atlantic, working on Brexit and Donald Trump’s election team. It is a key subject in two inquiries in the UK – by the Electoral Commission, into the firm’s possible role in the EU referendum, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, into data analytics for political purposes – and one in the US, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump-Russia collusion. The Observer revealed this week that the company had harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. Emma Graham-Harrison","Photograph: The Washington Post","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The key point is that all of this was allowed by the terms and conditions under which he was operating. Thousands of other Facebook apps were also operating under similar T&Cs – and had been since 2007, when the company turned its social networking service into an application platform.","So Kogan was only a bit player in the data-hoovering game: apps such as the insanely popular Candy Crush, for example, were also able to collect players’ public profiles, friends lists and email addresses. And Facebook seemed blissfully indifferent to this open door because it was central to its commercial strategy: the more apps there were on its platform the more powerful the network effects would be and the more personal data there would be to monetise.","That’s why the bigger story behind the current controversy is the fact that what Cambridge Analytica claimed to have accomplished would not have been possible without Facebook. Which means that, in the end, Facebook poses the problem that democracies will have to solve.","In that context, the firm’s response to the crisis has been instructive. The first stage was denial: there was no “data breach”; then there were legal threats and the heavy artillery of expensive law firms; after that we were treated to ludicrous attempts to portray a giant global corporation as an innocent victim of wicked people who did terrible things behind its back.","And then, finally – after an extended bout of corporate panic at its Californian HQ as the share price tanked – there was a return to euphemistic form as the boy wonder CEO came out from under the duvet wearing his signature grey T-shirt. He was in his sorrowful-but-resolute mode: “This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,” he wrote. “But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that. In this case, we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people’s information in this way. But there’s more we need to do … ”","If that sounds familiar, then that’s because it is. TechCrunch listed 11 separate controversies that resulted from Facebook being caught taking liberties with users’ data or trust. In most of these cases, the Zuckerberg response has been the same: sorrowful contrition followed by requests for forgiveness, topped off with resolutions to do better in future. The lad is beginning to sound like an alcoholic who, after his latest bout of drink-related excess, says sorry and expresses his determination to reform.","The trouble is that, as the veteran tech investor Om Malik pointed out this week, Facebook can’t reform without changing its very nature. “Facebook’s DNA,” he writes, “is that of a social platform addicted to growth and engagement. At its very core, every policy, every decision, every strategy is based on growth (at any cost) and engagement (at any cost). More growth and more engagement means more data – which means the company can make more advertising dollars, which gives it a nosebleed valuation on the stock market, which in turn allows it to remain competitive and stay ahead of its rivals.”","No amount of corporate spin can disguise that central truth. Facebook’s core business is exploiting the personal data of its users. That is its essence. So expecting it to wean itself off that exploitation is like trying to persuade ExxonMobil that it should get out of the oil and gas business.","That’s why the central question about the Cambridge Analytica controversy is whether it’s a scandal or a crisis. Scandals create a lot of noise and heat, but nothing much changes as a result. Crises are what lead to fundamental change. Facebook’s response – and its corporate DNA – suggest that it’s just a scandal. So stay tuned for the next data breach."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

On Monday, an analyst report warned of a temporary pullback in advertising and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission confirmed it’s investigating the social network’s privacy practices.","The data issue has reverberations in Canada: Christopher Wylie, the man who helped found Cambridge Analytica, the firm at the heart of the controversy, and then became its whistle-blower, is Canadian and has done work with the federal Liberal Party. Mr. Wylie has also said he helped start a B.C.-based consultancy company that did work helping the “leave” side of the Brexit vote to circumvent campaign spending laws.","In his first interview since taking on the head job at Facebook Canada in December, Garrick Tiplady talked to The Globe and Mail about his priorities for the company and rebuilding trust with its users.","Story continues below advertisement","The Cambridge Analytica situation has deep Canadian roots. The question that may raise in some Canadians’ minds is: We’ve seen Brexit, we’ve seen the U.S. election. Are the upcoming elections in Canada vulnerable?","First and foremost, it’s our job to ensure the platform is safe. We launched, several months ago, the Elections Integrity Initiative, coming out of what we saw in the U.S. Within Canada specifically, coming out of the [Communications Security Establishment] report [in June, which warned that “hacktivist groups will deploy cybercapabilities in an attempt to influence the democratic process in 2019”], there are really two main initiatives. One is cybersecurity, making sure that if any parliamentarian has been hacked, there is an immediate response. In addition we’re working with MediaSmarts on digital literacy, making sure people have information so they can make educated decisions about what they see. That’s where “view ads” comes in. [A tab on the Facebook pages of political parties and brands that will show any ads that page is running, and each ad’s target audience.] It’s the next level of standards around transparency. We’ve rolled that out in Canada and we’re planning to roll it out globally.","The events of last week related to data that were being shared with friends through an app. That was shut down three years ago. We take full responsibility for that, and we’re putting in more processes to make sure that doesn’t happen again. We’re adding 10,000 people [globally] in the organization – so going from 10,000 to [eventually] 20,000, we’re at 14,000 now – solely focused on safety and security on the platform. We’re continuing to invest so we’re ahead of the curve.","The specific issue of apps that ask for permission to view friends’ profiles with low security settings, has been addressed. But the problem of data is bigger than Facebook: the entire digital economy, the promise of digital advertising, is based on advertisers being able to see who is online and to know what their behaviours and preferences are, so that they can target ads. That requires a lot of data. It requires continuing to surveil people. Is this a problem that can even be fixed?","It’s our responsibility to make sure that customers’ data are safe, and that customers know how to manage their data online. I think there’s a world – and I believe our platform does this today – where we can continue to allow our customers to have the privacy and the ability to manage their own data in a way that’s transparent, with complete control, but also allow advertisers to continue to send targeted messages to those customers. Not in a personally identified way, but on an aggregated basis.","But there have been reports that the Custom Audiences tool you use to target ads has been vulnerable to re-identifying that anonymized data. Are you working on that?","That’s at the core of everything we do. We don’t sell personalized data, point blank. On the anonymized side, as long as we continue to make sure that nobody has access to that personal information, that’s where we want to continue to invest.","Story continues below advertisement","Story continues below advertisement","A new Angus-Reid poll found that 64 per cent of Canadians surveyed said they plan to either change their privacy settings or cut down on their Facebook use because of the data issue. And a further 10 per cent said they are thinking of shutting down their Facebook accounts or suspending them. This is having an impact in Canada. Is that entirely negative? Is it maybe even healthy that people change their behavior on Facebook?","That really gets to the heart of this trust component. If we can’t keep our customers safe, we don’t deserve to serve them. Period. So we need to make sure that we put the tools in place; we have the policies; we include tools on the platform. We have to do that. People should know how their data are being used, and we need to make sure that is far more visible on our platform.","People leaving the platform are pushed to deactivate – which leaves all their data with Facebook – rather than delete their accounts altogether, which is also an option. There’s a lot about the privacy settings that default to sharing information rather than not sharing, and it can feel like a lot of work to keep those settings locked down. The default to share more of your data with Facebook helps with your business model, since your customers are ultimately your advertisers. But are you giving any thought to a need to introduce a new default where things are locked down unless someone explicitly opts in?","The one thing that has really struck me about Facebook coming in, is how committed the company is to transparency and user control. That has been the approach I’ve seen with the executive team.","Recently some marketers have raised some concerns. Subway Restaurants said they are decreasing ad spend on Facebook over concerns that their ads weren’t being seen; and there have been reports that Facebook more recently has had to do outreach with marketers who are worried about the data revelations. Are you hearing concerns in Canada?","Over the last week, the conversation has changed. I’ve spoken to quite a few of our partners. While there are a lot of hard questions of late, when we describe what we’re doing to improve the platform, our partners are pleased with where we’re going.","Story continues below advertisement","Regulators are starting to sit up and take notice. Here in Canada, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner is formally investigating Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica data, and the House ethics committee voted to investigate as well. Mark Zuckerberg has said he’s open to regulation. What do you think would be appropriate regulatory steps to address this?","We welcome all of the discussions. The way Mark characterized it, it’s not a matter of when but what kind of regulation – when we look at regulation, we believe there needs to be a much higher standard of transparency around ads. Some of the work we’ve already started to do, we’re not waiting for regulation.","Do you think Facebook is bad for democracy?","I believe the mission of Facebook in bringing people together and engaging with community is absolutely the right thing to do. With that comes a huge amount of responsibility. We need to make sure that the platform has the protections in place to protect against that.","A big competitor of yours, Google, has been vocal about its responsibility to sustaining journalism. Facebook is where a lot of people are getting their news. Have you thought about your role in the information ecosystem, the potential need to prioritize higher-quality information?","We have. We have a big responsibility to make sure the sources people see are trusted sources. We’ve got capabilities in place to make sure that some of the content you referenced earlier is being de-prioritized or taken off the platform altogether. We’ve got a big commitment to that.","Quality of information is one thing, but how do you fix the Facebook filter bubble, where people only hear from the community they’ve chosen?","It is hard. The filter bubble question, I have this conversation all the time. When you think about it, the interactions you have with your friends, I can tell you my friends have a very diverse set of opinions. You are getting that mix. We’re never going to get it 100 per cent right. But we need to continue to promote diversity in conversation.

The firms’ employees, who often overlap, had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil, the Russian oil giant.","Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey. SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature, and SCL also said there were no meetings in London.","(...)","Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

As such, Mr. Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence in person to the Committee.\"","The \"deputies\" offered up to MPs are two long-serving Facebook executives: the chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer and the chief product officer Chris Cox.","You can read the letter in full via this tweet from the Bloomberg reporter Joe Mayes:","Collins responded to Facebook's letter in a statement Tuesday. He said \"we would still like to hear from Mr Zuckerberg as well\" but said that the committee was \"very happy to invite Mr Cox to give evidence.\"","Collins also released a written statement about Zuckerberg's decision not to give evidence:","\"Facebook has got many questions to answer that their executives have failed to answer in previous appearances before our Committee.

Although only about 270,000 people took the survey, the New York Times reports that Kogan was able to obtain data on 50 million users, likely through connections between friends on the network. While the project promised users the data collection was only for research purposes, it nevertheless funneled the data to Cambridge Analytica, which had funded the development of the app to the tune of $800,000. Kogan had also received funding from the Russian government for his research into the psychology of Facebook users, the Guardian reported.","We don’t yet know how effective Cambridge Analytica’s targeting, based on psychological profiles its CEO has described as its “secret sauce,” truly was, but after working with Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign in the Republican primary, Cambridge Analytica was tapped by the Trump campaign. The company also did data analytics work on the successful Leave.EU campaign that resulted in a vote for Britain to exit the European Union. What we do seem to have, following these revelations about the source of some of the company’s data, is yet another in a long string of instances and coincidences—like the meetings between Trump campaign staff and Russian operatives—that look a lot like a willingness to cheat to win the White House, possibly in violation of the law. And in this case, cheating with data that was taken through Facebook’s front door.","Cambridge Analytica isn’t your typical data analytics firm. Its primary backer is Robert Mercer, the secretive billionaire and former CEO of the New York investment firm Renaissance Technologies whose family is also one of the main funders of Breitbart News and was the largest donor to Trump-backing Super PACs during the 2016 election. Steve Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, was the vice president of Cambridge Analytica’s board at the same time he was chairman of Breitbart News.","The data firm started partnering with U.S. political campaigns around 2015 with the promise that it had the ability to do what it called “psychographic” targeting, which allowed Cambridge Analytica to create psychological profiles to “effectively engage and persuade voters using specially tailored language and visual ad combinations” that appeal to each person on an emotional level, according to Cambridge Analytica’s website. The company claims it’s able to build these profiles by leveraging “up to 5,000 data points on over 230 million American voters.” That last number is a lot bigger than the 50 million people reported in the New York Times, and it’s unclear where that remaining data came from.","Advertisement","Cambridge Analytica began contracting for Trump’s campaign in June 2016, roughly six months after the Guardian reported that the company, when working for Cruz, was targeting voters using data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge. Facebook confirmed in August 2016 that data from Kogan’s app collected and misused data from the company and that Facebook was taking efforts to delete it. Still, Facebook didn’t alert users that their data had potentially ended up in the hands of Republican operatives.","The personality quiz created by Kogan appeared in 2014 on a platform for freelancers run by Amazon called Mechanical Turk.* The quiz, posted by Kogan’s company Global Science Research, offered to pay participants $1 or $2 to complete it and also required participants to download an app and consent to sharing data about themselves and their social network. At the time the quiz and app were running, Facebook permitted app developers to access data about a person’s network, like the names of their friends, as well as their likes and other personal details about themselves and their network, according to Facebook’s head of security, Alex Stamos, in a series of now-deleted tweets. The company says it has now updated its policies to let users decide what information Facebook can share about them.","Facebook says, however, that when Kogan passed the data he collected to Cambridge Analytica, he violated the company’s rather permissive data collection rules and in 2015 demanded that Kogan and everyone he handed the data to destroy it and certify that they did so. Facebook says it received certifications that the data was deleted from both Kogan and Cambridge Analytica, as well as from Christopher Wylie, who helped to found Cambridge Analytica. (Wylie and other former employees of the company gave interviews to the New York Times and the Guardian about Cambridge Analytica.) But apparently not all the data was deleted, and the New York Times reports that it was able to view a portion of the Facebook user data that still exists. The contract that Kogan initially had with Cambridge Analytica also allowed him to keep a copy of the data he scrapped for his research.","Kogan claimed in an email to Cambridge Analytica in 2014 that the data he was collecting would be able to predict a person’s neuroticism, political views, agreeableness, and interests in things like militarism, horoscopes, and the environment. These data points could be what Cambridge Analytica is referring to when it claims that it’s capable of psychologically targeting American voters.","Advertisement","“Without Facebook, we wouldn’t have won,” said Theresa Hong, a member of the digital arm of Trump’s presidential campaign, in an interview with the BBC last year when giving a tour of Trump’s digital campaign headquarters, dubbed Project Alamo, in San Antonio, Texas. Alamo was the name of the dataset used by Cambridge Analytica, according to Hong, who said Cambridge Analytica shared offices with the Trump campaign’s digital efforts and confirmed Facebook and Google sent liaisons to their offices to help Trump’s campaign. Hong showed the BBC how Cambridge Analytica could identify if, say, it was targeting a working mother concerned about childcare: She probably wouldn’t be interested in “a war ridden destructive ad” popping up in her Facebook app, but might respond to something more “warm and fuzzy,” lacking Trump’s voice, Hong said. “It wasn’t uncommon to have about 35 to 45 thousand iterations of these types of ads everyday.”","Cambridge Analytica also bragged publicly about its use of data and voter modeling during the election, which sparked the interest of David Carroll, a professor at Parsons School of Design who studies media, data targeting, and campaigns. In January 2017, he requested under the U.K.’s data protection law to see if any of his personal data had been shipped to Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, based in London. Last year, Carroll learned that Cambridge Analytica had given him scores on a scale of 1 to 10 on certain hot-button political categories, like a “gun rights importance rank.” Based on these scores, he was ultimately listed as “unlikely” to vote Republican. On Friday, the same day Facebook moved to suspend Cambridge Analyica’s account, Carrol filed a legal claim in the U.K. to learn what the company did with his data and if it was handed to anyone else.","Cambridge Analytica was roped into Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election this past December when it requested to see employee emails, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The firm also may be in hot water with the Federal Election Commission, which has rules about how non-U.S. persons are allowed to work on political campaigns. Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, is British and many of the company’s employees were either European or Canadian.","On Saturday, Cambridge Analytica responded to Facebook’s allegations and the reports in the New York Times and Guardian, writing that Wylie was a contractor and not a founder of the company and claiming that all of the Facebook data provided by Kogan was erased as soon as the company learned it was obtained illegitimately.","Advertisement","In his now-deleted Twitter thread, Facebook’s Stamos said that Kogan’s handing of Facebook user data to Cambridge Analytica wasn’t technically a breach, since he “didn’t break into any systems, bypass technical controls, or use a flaw in our system to gather more data than allowed.” All of which means Kogan took a startling amount of user data that he was permitted to take—even if he wasn’t supposed to hand it over to a voter-targeting operation after taking it. Other app developers may have harvested data from users in the way Krogan and Cambridge Analytica did under Facebook’s old rules, too, and there’s no telling where that data might have ended up. Since 2015, Facebook has changed its policies, limiting the amount of user data third-party apps can siphon from the network—although it still allows sophisticated political targeting through its advertising platform, the kind which the Trump campaign was able to use, likely abetted by the Cambridge Analytica data set. None of this is surprising, of course, but it should be galling. Facebook’s primary job is making money, after all—and even careful policies can’t always control for the scrupulousness of how its customers use its primary product: our data.","Correction, March 19, 2018: This article originally misspelled the name of the platform Mechanical Turk."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

It had a lot to do with [not solely] online data, but everything from what kind of car you drove to what kind of magazines you subscribed to.”","Data has been used in political campaigns since the age of Jackson—where the populist candidate targeted voters in line with his image of “the common man.” But as computers became readily affordable for Americans, the 1990s saw the rise of big data, consumer patterns and a shift away from government funded information resources.","“Data is not some nebulous concept,” explained Philips. “We’ve been gathering data on people for as long as there’s been campaigns. We’ve been trying to figure out who we want to talk to and what they care to hear about. When you get larger and larger campaigns, it becomes less and less about the individual and more and more about groups. When you get smaller campaigns, you really are targeting individual people.”","“People have been trying to microtarget and create psychometric profiles for decades. We are now in an era where it’s become very easy to do,” reaffirmed Sam Abrams, a political science professor at Sarah Lawrence College. “To me, this is business as usual. It is shocking that people don’t realize that Facebook is a media company designed to sell ads and take data and profile people who are on it. The whole point is to assemble profiles on every individual user and monetize it.”","Pioneered in Silicon Valley circa 2002, microtargeting is a marketing strategy drawing on consumer data to influence individuals. Consulting firms like The Analysis Group and political scientists like Stan Greenberg—a former Yale professor who studied polling effects in New Haven, Conn. and Macomb County, Mich.—pushed the practice into modern politics. During 2008 and 2012, the Obama campaigns retained former Facebook employees, revolutionizing how candidates targeted key demographics.","“It’s well known the Democrats are much better coordinated with microtargeting,” said Abrams. “The people who were pioneering the technology were more liberal. A lot of tech people revel in the fact they reject old-school hierarchies, and old school hierarchies were very pronounced for the GOP. ”","Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign relied heavily on microtargeting. But during times of technological, political and social upheaval, the practice has blindspots.","“Data doesn’t vote. That was the big takeaway from the Hillary Clinton [campaign], which is that they spent all their time on data,” said Philips. “They spent all their time on data analytics and all their energy on data analytics that they didn’t see the loss coming. At the end of the day, data is a wonderful tool, but it doesn’t vote.”","“The issue now is that microtargeting is harder than ever because what happens in Parkland, Florida within seconds is known in Portland, Maine,” said Abrams. “Hillary would go around and make claims that were very regional and people would call her a hypocrite because she’d say something in one place that was different than another.”","But the Cambridge Analytica revelations signal that, even though the Clinton campaign failed to leverage big data effectively, the practice still dominates politics. In future campaigns, the tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign are expected to further define the modern political landscape.","“First, you’re going to see microtargeting continue. You’re going to see people continue to try to data-mine and continue to try to target people; there is a camp of people who think that if you’re able to identify this, you really can sway elections,” explained Abrams. “And then the flip side is, if you look at Trump, there is a narrative that can exist which says, ‘Microtargeting is one thing, but messaging, if you can tap into the right story at the right time, can be more powerful than that.'”","Though the underlying reasoning on data gathering to study and predict demographic voting trends has not changed, its methods and processes have: under the guise of academic research, Cambridge Analytica acquired the voter profiles of millions of Facebook users who voluntarily surrendered their data. Users may not have consented to their data’s release for partisan purposes, but such is the number one rule governing internet privacy: There is no such thing as internet privacy.","While Zuckerberg does damage control for Facebook, the company lobbies for legislation that makes it easier for foreign governments to collect the data of U.S. citizens. As hostile powers like Russia influence elections abroad, British consulting firms like Cambridge Analytica are coming under scrutiny for their involvement in American politics.","“While it may have been a British company that got caught, the fact is that it’s a global trend,” concluded Abrams. “Your data is of interest to people globally and can be manipulated and stolen and used by people anywhere around the world.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

No? Well, for those that have been living under a rock, I’ll explain: the fact that Facebook has been harvesting personal data and selling it to advertisers and government agencies has finally come to the forefront of mainstream media and people are not happy. In fact, the data sale is apparently so deep and relevant that it is being rumoured that Mark Zuckerberg’s platform is responsible for Trump getting in power and Brexit being voted in. Fascinating.","Well, whether or not Facebook is responsible for all the western world’s recent moral dilemmas still remains to be seen but, one thing is for sure, we could all do with a little extra privacy when we are browsing online and trying to communicate with one and other.","The idea that a social media platform could be swaying the opinions of people so much that it is actually having an effect on the outcomes of pivotal democratic votes is the stuff of a Charlie Brooker screenplay, but it is entirely possible, dare I say it, it’s even plausible.","For years the ‘tin foil hat wearers‘ of society have been telling us all that our computers are listening to us and watching us, and that our government’s are using the data we post online to control us, while big businesses are using it to make us buy their products, and have been laughed out of the room each time. Well, in light of the recent news, it seems they could have been right all along.","Enter the Blockchain","All the recent revelations about data being leaked and people being controlled via computational algorithms has caused quite a stir and, in my opinion, is just the tip of the iceberg. There is a saying I like to use: if what the news reports is bad, what they don’t report is evil. It might sound a bit like a conspiracy but it is a saying I live by and I would not be surprised if the problem being reported actually runs a hell of a lot deeper than is being let on.","But what can we do as citizens? Truthfully, if you want to use social media, not much right now. Due to the centralised nature of all the major social media websites they will always be susceptible to corruption and their owners will always require the ability to own and sell your data as their means of getting paid.","When you think about it, the likes of Facebook and Twitter are simply advertising platforms with a locked audience which is forced to view ads. To add to that, the adverts they are forced to view are actually tailored to the viewers entire chat history which makes them much more likely to be successful.","With a decentralised social media network it would be impossible for this to happen, depending on how the network is coded, of course. Due to the nature of blockchain technology it would be entirely possible for each user to own their own data (the main selling point of many crypto start-ups) through the use of encryption.","By allowing all users to encrypt their private data with a private key system all information which is publicly accessible would be decided by the user and not the platform owner.

Options available included “Facebook users decide the rules by voting and tell Facebook” and “Facebook decides the rules on its own”.","In neither survey question did Facebook allow users to indicate that law enforcement or child protection should be involved in the situation: the strictest option allowed involved turning to the social network as arbiter.","Yvette Cooper MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, condemned the survey. “This is a stupid and irresponsible survey,” she said. “Adult men asking 14-year-olds to send sexual images is not only against the law, it is completely wrong and an appalling abuse and exploitation of children. I cannot imagine that Facebook executives ever want it on their platform but they also should not send out surveys that suggest they might tolerate it or suggest to Facebook users that this might ever be acceptable.”","Other parts of the survey asked similar questions about content glorifying extremism, and asked users to rank how important they felt it was that Facebook’s policies were developed in a transparent manner, were fair, took into account different cultural norms, and achieved “the ‘right outcome’”.","Facebook’s vice president of product, Guy Rosen, said the surveys were “a mistake”.","“We run surveys to understand how the community thinks about how we set policies,” he said. “But this kind of activity is and will always be completely unacceptable on FB.

What do you search online? Where do you spend your time on the internet and what do you do when you're there? Where do you shop? What do you buy? This is all data.

And it just got even worse for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The British House of Commons has officially sent Zuck a letter asking him to come to London and testify about how he plans to “fix” Facebook. Best of luck with that, mate.","The letter, which was just published to Twitter by technology reporters in the UK, explains that the government committee overseeing digital privacy had already heard from Facebook officials, but that those representatives from the social media company had been “misleading.”","Advertisement","The UK now wants a high-level executive, preferably Zuckerberg himself, to go to London and testify about the “catastrophic failure” of Facebook’s handling of private user information.","The letter reads:","Dear Mr Zuckerberg","Request for oral evidence","Following material published in the UK Guardian and the New York Times over the past few days, the Committee would like to request that you appear before us to give oral evidence.","As I said in my statement, the Committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent. Your officials’ answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the Committee.","It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process. There is a strong public interest test regarding user protection. Accordingly we are sure you will understand the need for a representative from right at the top of the oganisation to address concerns. Given your committment at the start of the New Year to “fixing” Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.","We would like to receive your response by Monday 26 March.","Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter. Update, 1:09pm: Facebook just sent us this statement from Paul Grewal, VP and Deputy General Counsel:","We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.","Advertisement","The House of Commons will already be hearing from a former Facebook employee as early as tomorrow. Sandy Parakilas worked on the security team at the social media company and told the Guardian in an article published today that he tried to warn Facebook about the potential for data breaches. Parakilas paints a dark picture of an information gathering free-for-all by incredibly shady characters.","“Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on,” Parakilas told the Guardian.","Facebook has come under increased scrutiny in the past few days after it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica used the data of over 50 million Facebook users to exploit their fears and launch a sophisticated propaganda campaign on behalf of Donald Trump’s team.","Advertisement","And to make things even worse for Facebook, it also came to light just yesterday that Cambridge Analytica engages in some pretty dirty business practices. Britain’s Channel Four ran a 20-minute documentary with undercover footage of the company’s CEO admitting that the company orchestrates bribes of politicians with the explicit purpose of filming those encounters and releasing the footage online.","The company’s CEO, Alexander Nix, also admits to bringing sex workers from Ukraine into various countries in order to entice government officials with sex. Those encounters are also filmed and used to discredit candidates around the world, Nix says in the video.","And if that wasn’t enough, the rumor mill is now swirling with reports that Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer, is resigning over disagreements with other top executives at the media company. Specifically, Stamos is reportedly upset that Facebook isn’t being more upfront about the ways its platform was used to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election.","The New York Times reports that Stamos wanted to quit but was “persuaded to stay” until August. Top leadership at Facebook apparently thought it would look bad to have Stamos jump ship while the ship was on fire. Which isn’t altogether wrong.","Facebook’s stock price plummeted yesterday on news that the company is imploding. And Facebook plans to hold a company-wide meeting today to discuss the shitshow. But we’ll see if it can pull out of this nosedive.","Advertisement","With Zuck himself totally silent, it should be interesting to see how he responds to a request to testify in the UK. So far, the US hasn’t formally asked top social media executives to testify, though that could be changing. Democratic Senator Mark Warner tweeted that he’d like to see Zuck and other CEOs testify in front of Congress.

Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update: Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","I’m going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","See the full visual","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick Guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","See the full visual","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update: Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","I'm going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back.

And that is very bad news for the Social Democrats, the opposition party that is trying to convince itself and the country that it can oust Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right coalition Jan. 25. Already in dismal shape, the Social Democrats are finding their historically close ties to the unions an electoral albatross.","In a sense, the mighty German Labor Federation, operating in a nation where 38 percent of the 22 million members of the labor force are unionized, is a victim of its own success. Once the pride of a restored German democracy - disciplined, militant when necesssary, but flexible and farsighted enough to make concessions that created jobs over time - the union federation took advantage of the country's postwar boom and went into business itself.","That decision was in keeping with German and Scandinavian trade union traditions, and it gave the federation economic muscle useful in labor negotiations. In the boom years, a sprawling union holding company, known by its German initials, BGAG, did well in banking, insurance and housing. Unlike its capitalist counterparts, however, it had difficulty imposing belt-tightening discipline in the leaner 1970's.","Four years ago, massive corruption and mismanagement were uncovered in BGAG's housing concern, Neue Heimat, which with 190,000 units and 900,000 tenants is the biggest in Western Europe. A few managerial heads rolled, but the rot was not checked, and tenants became nervous.","Now a second installment of the sleazy Neue Heimat story has seized public attention just in time for the elections. With the concern sagging under $8.5 billion in debt and tipping into bankruptcy, the holding company sold Neue Heimat to Horst Schiesser, an obscure Berlin businessman, for a token price, one deutschmark. An Outcry in Bonn","This unloading was seen as an admission of gross union mismanagement; Neue Heimat's losses are running at $300 million a year. The sale raised an outcry in Bonn, where a parliamentary subcommittee began to probe union business practices. The federation has also decided to sell more than half of its bank and is expected to sell half of its insurance company.","When the parliamentary committee summoned Alfons Lappas, the BGAG chairman, he refused to testify. In Hamburg, marshals appeared and arrested him in the hall where IG Metall, the biggest union in the world, was holding its congress. Tempers flared, and from the podium one union leader angrily compared Mr. Lappas' detention to the Nazis' suppression of freedom in 1933. After five days in jail, Mr. Lappas was freed on appeal and was shown on television being whisked away in his chauffeur-driven Mercedes. Then, a Bonn court ruled that the union executive should be imprisoned again if he continued to balk at testifying, but Mr. Lappas appealed to the supreme court.","Revelations about Mr. Lappas' super-bourgeois lifestyle did not endear him to the blue-collar rank and file. The executive has a villa built on Neue Heimat land in the rolling countryside north of Frankfurt, favored by bankers and other capitalists, and he indulges in bear-hunting in Hungary and safaris in Kenya. ''There are things that happen in this republic that no one could imagine,'' exploded Heiner Geissler, a leading member of the governing Christian Democrats. He pointed out that Mr. Lappas, while earning $367,000 a year, was being ''cheered as a hero of labor at a union congress''","The voters' reaction to the Neue Heimat scandal has been emphatic. In Bavarian state elections in September, the Social Democrats won a miserable 27.5 percent of the vote - their worst showing since World War II. The losses were heaviest in districts of Munich and Nuremberg where Neue Heimat tenants reside.","Party strategists fear a similar backlash today in state elections in Hamburg, where the Social Democrats hold an absolute majority and where Neue Heimat has its headquarters. ''It's hurting us a lot,'' conceded Peter Glotz, a top Social Democrat in Bonn, seated under a red-and-white flow chart showing the high points of the Social Democrats' underdog campaign for the Bundes tag elections in January.","While sympathizing with the Social Democrats' plight, German trade unionists are worried more about their own. Privately, they acknowledge that the unions are passing through their deepest crisis of confidence since the war. And, with little prospect of evicting the Kohl coalition in January, they fear a piecemeal erosion of the gains made during the 13 years the Social Democrats had been in power.","Already, the Kohl Government, over angry union protests, has pushed through a law that prevents workers idled indirectly by a strike from collecting unemployment pay. And the Neue Heimat parliamentary committee promises further headline-catching revelations about squandered union monies and high-living functionaries like Mr. Lappas, who was unflatteringly featured on the cover of a recent issue of Der Spiegel as ''Der Bonze'' - ''The Bigwig.''","We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.

{"originalurl":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2018/03/19/the-problem-isnt-cambridge-analytica-its-facebook/#354cad0358a5","title":"The Problem Isn't Cambridge Analytica: It's Facebook","text":["The Problem Isn't Cambridge Analytica: It's Facebook","Cambridge Analytica garnered headlines across the world on Friday as Facebook formally suspended the company from its platform over allegations that it had improperly received and retained data on tens of millions of Facebook users from an academic researcher that had originally obtained the data legally and properly in accordance with previous Facebook developer guidelines. However, whether or not the allegations are true (the company has denied them), the singular focus on Cambridge Analytica makes for a simple meme-worthy media narrative, but the reality is that what the company stands accused of by Facebook is in fact what academic researchers, commercial enterprises, governments and even the social media companies themselves do every day with the data entrusted to them by a quarter of the earth’s population.","Perhaps the most remarkable takeaway from coverage of the 2016 election is just how starkly changed the reaction of the public and media has been to political use of data-driven election targeting since the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns. When the Obama campaign pushed the boundaries of precision voter targeting, pioneering techniques like peering into the privacy of American’s living rooms through their DVRs to see what each individual voter was actually watching on their televisions, the press and public cheered, hailing it as a long overdue modernization of the campaigning process and holding up the campaign’s data scientists as miniature heroes showcasing what could be done with data today. In the leadup to the 2016 election, the press and public derided the Trump campaign as apparently being data-devoid, while hailing Clinton’s campaign as picking up the data-first mantle from the Obama campaign and pushing it even further.","In short, data was good and pushing the privacy and ethical boundaries of data to monitor and manipulate voters was a positive, modernizing campaigning in line with the commercial advertising world. Even 1984-ish techniques like mining private DVR viewing habits were lauded as brilliant innovations to advance democracy, not frightening autocratic steps towards a surveillance state.","A year later in the midst of a stunning election upset and investigations of Russian influence, the tenor towards data-driven politicking has turned upside down, with a public outcry over the perceived power of data-driven campaigning to allegedly overwhelm organic public will. Though, before attributing absolute campaigning power to data, it is important to remember that Cruz’s failed presidential bid relied on the same firm and data that is credited with Trump’s win, calling into question the level of impact it actually had.","A central theme of the rhetoric and coverage of Cambridge Analytica is that it somehow violated accepted societal norms over the use of Facebook data, with politicians, regulators and major news outlets referring to it in the cybersecurity parlance of a data “breach.” In fact, this could not be further from the truth in our modern “surveillance economy.”","Facebook and other social media data has, almost from its inception, been a major data source for academic research, with little to no ethical concern for its utilization. Perhaps most famously, in 2008 Harvard and UCLA researchers released a massive dataset compiled from the Facebook accounts of an entire cohort of college students, with the full ethical and legal approval of Facebook and Harvard, full approval of Harvard’s IRB and funding from the National Science Foundation. When asked in 2016 whether its views had evolved since the 2008 release, the university never responded, despite multiple requests to different offices.","In 2014 academic researchers at Cornell and Facebook published research in which they had manipulated the emotions of three quarters of a million users and which was published in one of the top scientific journals, PNAS. As with the Harvard study, the research had been fully approved by Facebook and Cornell, with ethical review by Cornell’s IRB.","Like the Harvard study 6 years before, the 2014 emotions study generated an immense public, press and academic backlash, with Facebook stating it had redesigned its ethical review process and the journal issuing a statement of editorial concern. Yet, when I followed up in 2016 about how views had changed towards that kind of research at Facebook, Cornell and PNAS, Facebook declined to release any substantive information about its ethics panel beyond a brief overview nor would it release the protocols it uses to review research or the guidelines it requires its researchers to adhere to. As I noted at the time, “In short, Facebook would not share any details beyond its previous 2014 statement on what changes it has actually made internally, while Cornell and PNAS both noted that they have made only minimal changes. Combined with Harvard’s failure to respond to multiple requests for comment, this suggests that even in the highest-profile cases involving the nation’s top universities with strong Common Rule-compliant IRB systems and at the most prestigious journals in academia, there are few actual changes made in the aftermath of an ethical firestorm. Put another way, in spite of the outpouring of public criticism and claims that new ethical standards are needed, little actual change ever happens and after a brief period of conversation and consternation, things go back to the way they were.”","Indeed, three years later it appears little did change at Facebook, with the company’s internal researchers becoming embroiled in yet another ethical firestorm regarding psychological profiling when it emerged that they had been conducting secret research on more than 6.4 million Australian youth as young as 14 years old to determine when they were at their most vulnerable, experiencing feelings of being “worthless” or a “failure” in order to better target them for advertisers. When details of the secret research leaked to the press, the company’s response was that it had not followed its ethical review process, but that the failure to adhere to its ethical review process was merely a minor “oversight.”","As I noted at the time, “the company emphasized that it has a strong ethical review process that determines what constitutes allowable research and must issue approval for any internal company research of sensitive nature conducted on its users and that in this case two employees went ahead and used their privileged access to search for the most vulnerable emotional moments of young children without ever submitting their research for review, and the company’s response is that this is not a major breach of research protocol that requires an immediate suspension and review of sensitive research across the company, but rather just a minor 'oversight' not to be worried about.”","More remarkably, that two Facebook researchers could conduct research on such an extraordinarily sensitive topic on such a vulnerable population and tout that research to advertisers without ever having their work ethically reviewed and, according to the company, without its formal knowledge and approval, suggests Facebook has woefully inadequate central controls over the use of its users’ data by its own researchers. Indeed, its reaction to the unauthorized research, labeling it as a minor “oversight” and especially its refusal to comment on whether it had identified other unauthorized research and whether it would be tightening its data access controls, as troubling at best.","In this light, Cambridge Analytica’s alleged use of Facebook data for voter targeting pales in comparison with the ways in which Facebook itself exploits its private user data for its own purposes and those of the researchers that collaborate with it.","It is also not the first time that the company has found itself under scrutiny for commercial targeting based on its data. In 2016 Facebook and Twitter terminated social media monitoring company Geofeedia’s access to its data streams after the ACLU published a report documenting how it was being used to surveil lawful protest activity in the United States. Facebook predictably denied knowledge of how Geofeedia was using its data, yet when the ACLU discovered an email referencing a confidential agreement between Geofeedia and Facebook to provide the company with additional Facebook data, Facebook declined to comment further. As I noted at the time, “it is difficult to imagine that neither Facebook nor Twitter had any idea of any kind that one of their licensees was using their data to provide surveillance capabilities to law enforcement. Geofeedia is far from a James Bond cloak-and-dagger defense contractor operating in the shadows – it is a widely known commercial company widely and openly touting its capabilities through numerous case studies and receiving considerable media coverage that specifically discussed its law enforcement clients, while the FBI openly issued an RFP for its services as part of its larger interest in social monitoring. In short, even the most basic of web searches easily turned up that law enforcement was a client of GeoFeedia’s and this thus raises the question of how Twitter and Facebook never noticed that a high-profile subscriber of their services, especially one that allegedly was signing additional special licensing agreements with Facebook, would never have appeared on their radars.”","Of course, academia has been a massive consumer of social media data as well, employing its wealth of data for all sorts of extraordinarily sensitive and ethically questionable research.","Just six months ago two Stanford University researchers set off an avalanche of ethical concern with a paper that used an AI model to estimate a person’s sexual orientation based purely on a photograph of their face, raising concerns of imprisonment and even execution for LGBT individuals living in repressive countries. The paper was published in an APA journal and reviewed full ethical approval from their IRB, reinforcing the common theme of top journals and institutions as freely accepting sensitive research on social data. Demonstrating the stark divide between the written ethical policies of academia and what actually happens in practice with social data research, Stanford had previously provided comment to me documenting what was one of the most rigorous ethical review processes at an American university, including specialized privacy reviews and typically requiring a signed legal agreement with data vendors, along with noting explicitly that bulk downloading data from a website in violation of its terms of service was absolutely prohibited. Yet, when asked for comment on why those policies did not appear to have been enforced for this study, the university declined to offer comment, saying that it was not permitted to do so.","Much as Cambridge Analytica used data gathered from a Facebook personality quiz, the Stanford research also incorporated data from Facebook, gathered through a personality quiz called myPersonality, described as “a popular Facebook application that allowed users to take real psychometric tests, and allowed us to record (with consent!) their psychological and Facebook profiles. Currently, our database contains more than 6,000,000 test results, together with more than 4,000,000 individual Facebook profiles.” As of October 2015, more than 7.5 million people had taken the questionnaire and the resulting data had been used by more than 200 researchers, including at least one Facebook data scientist. That Facebook's own researchers have used such external personality quiz datasets is intriguing in light of its concerns with Cambridge Analytica's activities.","Despite declining to comment on the questions posed regarding the study’s ethical considerations, Stanford did provide a brief statement from one of the authors regarding its use of more than 3 million images from Facebook: the images are “secondary data that we have obtained from myPersonality app. The users gave the app permission to use their data.” In short, the users clicked a button authorizing their data to be used for research, so they knew what they were getting into and that single personality quiz they took between 2007 and 2012 and long forgot about entitles researchers a decade later to continue to use their information for a publication in 2017.","One of the authors was also the lead author of a 2013 PNAS study that demonstrated that Facebook data can be used “to automatically and accurately predict a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender.”","Not a day goes by that I don’t see a request on an academic mailing list from a university researcher looking to extract a large volume of material from Facebook or announcing a new tool to make bulk extraction of user information from the platform easier. Any change the platform makes to restrict bulk access to its data is met with cries of foul. On the sidelines of any academic social sciences conference can be found any number of academics offering to ship bulk extracted Facebook data to fellow researchers.","Moreover, even when social media platforms become aware of explicit violations of their terms of service by researchers, it is unclear what consequences, if any, those researchers face. When asked about a study last year that estimated the political leanings of Twitter users in direct violation of the company’s explicit prohibition on political profiling, a company spokesperson confirmed that the research was a clear violation of its policy, that academic research was not in any way exempt from its policy and that the researchers had not received any authorization or permission from Twitter to conduct their research. Yet, despite confirming that the research was a direct violation of its policy, when asked whether it would take action against the researchers or any other researchers that violated its policies, the company did not respond.","For its part, Facebook modified its terms of service in May 2012 to enshrine its right to conduct research on its users, noting that “companies that want to improve their services use the information their customers provide, whether or not their privacy policy uses the word 'research' or not.” Yet, when asked whether the company would ever consider offering an option for users to opt-out of having their personal data used by Facebook for research, the company never responded.","Putting this all together, casting Cambridge Analytica as a villain gone rogue with “breached” data from Facebook offers a simple cathartic response to a world the press and public are struggling to understand, but it could not be further from the truth. Everything the company stands accused of (which again it strenuously denies) are simply what academics at universities all across the world do every day with the full knowledge and approval of their ethical oversight boards. Granting agencies like NSF routinely fund the research, IRBs approve it without question (typically treating it as “exempt”) and the top journals publish it. Indeed, Facebook itself has its own active research program, which as the Australian press leak demonstrates, is conducted under strict secrecy and according to the company itself, may occur without its knowledge or approval. Even when violations are brought to their attention, the companies will at best merely confirm the violations, either dismissing them as minor “oversights” or in the case of external researchers, apparently taking no action at all. It is little wonder then that social media data has found such a place in modern research and may have played such a pivotal role in the 2016 election, or as the Cruz campaign discovered, perhaps no role at all. All in all, it is remarkable how in the space of just 8 years data has gone from hero to villain in the world of campaigning, raising questions of whether this will be a tipping point against social media or just another brief bump in the road to quickly wash away. In the end, instead of holding Cambridge Analytica up as a villain, if society at large has concerns about how their Facebook social media personas can be used to monitor and potentially manipulate them, they should take a closer look at the platform that makes it all possible: Facebook.","Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years working to reimagine how we use data to understand the world around us at scales and in ways never before..."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Luckily, Facebook makes it relatively easy to control exactly what type of data such apps have access to.","Click the ‘Apps’ tab on the left to see a list of applications currently linked to your Facebook account.","Clicking on each app will show you exactly what information you are currently sharing with it. You can then edit the information you share with any given app by clicking the blue and white checkmark icons next to each ‘INFO YOU PROVIDE TO THIS APP’ category.","Taking these steps, however, does guarantee that an app won’t retain your past data. To ensure this, you will need to contact the app’s developer directly, which is possible by opening an app and then clicking the ‘Report/Contact’ link in the bottom right corner of your screen. You will need to have your app-specific user ID number handy, which can be found by clicking on an app on your ‘App Settings’ page and then scrolling to the bottom of the popup screen.","If there are any apps listed that you don’t recognize or no longer use, simply click the ‘X’ that pops up when you hover your mouse over its icon in order to deactivate it.","To add an additional level of security to your Facebook data, scroll down on the ‘App Settings’ page until you see the ‘Apps Others Use’ box. Click the ‘Edit’ button to see what information can be taken from your account when your Facebook friends use apps. If you don’t want your friends to inadvertently share things like your birthday, current city and timeline posts with the apps they use, uncheck all appropriate boxes.","If you haven’t done so already, to further enhance your account’s security you should also probably limit the audience of your posts and personal information to just your friends.","Doing this will let you download all of your posts, photos and videos as well as your ‘Activity Log,’ which essentially is a complete overview of everything you’ve ever done on Facebook, including your likes, comments, searches, messages, friend list, ads you’ve clicked on and IP addresses you’ve connected to Facebook from. Really, the amount of data contained in this document is dizzying -- and it will give you a very good idea of everything Facebook has collected on you over the years.","Once you press the ‘Delete My Account’ button, you’ll have to re-enter your password and decipher a garbled code to prove that you’re not a robot.","Once you’ve taken this step, your Facebook account should no longer be visible, though it can take up to 90 days for the company to scrub all of your posts and data from its servers.","Facebook makes it much easier to temporarily deactivate your account through the ‘Manage Account’ tab on your ‘General’ settings page, but doing this will not remove your personal data from the social media site. This might be a good first step, though, if you want to see if you can live a Facebook-free life.","You can also toggle your Facebook privacy settings from your smartphone’s Facebook app, though it is much easier to take these steps from your computer."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic","By David Shepardson","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leading U.S. consumer protection regulator and attorneys representing 37 states stepped up pressure on Facebook Inc (FB.O) on Monday to explain how the social network allowed data of 50 million users get into the hands of a political consultancy.","The U.S. Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing that it had opened an investigation into the company - which it generally only does in cases of great public interest - citing media reports that raise what it called \"substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.\"","On the same day, a bipartisan coalition of 37 state attorneys wrote to Facebook, demanding to know more about the company's role in the manipulation of users' data by the consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, which used it to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections.","“These revelations raise many serious questions concerning Facebook’s policies and practices, and the processes in place to ensure they are followed,” the letter said. \"We need to know that users can trust Facebook. With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.”","Facebook shares fell as much as 6.5 percent, briefly dipping below $150 for the first time since July 2017, before recovering the day's losses to close up 0.4 percent at $160.06.","The shares are still down 13 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica. The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.","The recovery in Facebook's stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company's relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.","The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.","If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.","Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company's privacy practices.","The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.","The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.","“Facebook's failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,\" said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.","In Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is \"absolutely certain\" that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.","Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.","\"The was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,\" Zuckerberg said in the ads. \"We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"","'FUTURE REGULATION'","His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany's justice minister said Facebook's promises were not enough.","\"In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,\" Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.","Advertisers and users are also unhappy.","U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet's YouTube for one week.","Internet company Mozilla Corp, Germany's second-largest bank Commerzbank AG (CBKG.DE) and British advertising group ISBA all suspended advertising on Facebook last week.","Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.","Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.","(Reporting by David Shepardson; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Susan Thomas)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Each and every time you accept that box, you are authorizing someone, somewhere access to a lot more than you realize. Your privacy and data has been bought sold and traded for free apps, .50 coupons at the store, drawings for a gift card at a basketball game, free tickets to the comedy club and more.","Over the last week you’ve probably heard or seen some of the whole dialogue about how Facebook failed to protect the privacy of their users resulting in a for profit data company, Cambridge Analytica, using that data to impact/influence the U.S. Election.","When Facebook first invited businesses to develop apps on their platform, they were allowed two kinds of functionality, Authentication or Authorization. Authentication allowed you to login, using facebook alone. Authorization allowed you (and the app) to interact with your connections.","Most apps chose the authorization route as it ultimately allowed them to add features like inviting friends to play [cough cough farmville, mafiawars, etc]. With that feature, they had a deep dive look into your user behavior, your contacts, your logins, etc.","Most app builders weren’t using all that data, but it was there and if they really wanted to, it could be exported. Once Facebook realized how much power they’d put in the hands of the app builders, they turned that feature off. Unfortunately Cambridge Analytica DID export the data and intended to use it even after they ‘promised’ they wouldn’t. Thats the readers digest description of what happened and the full details are on CNN if you want to better understand the entire situation.","Ultimately as this news has continued to trickle out, Facebook stock prices have plummeted and thousands of users are threatening to #DeleteFacebook. So far, Facebook says they haven’t really seen any actual change is user behavior so I’m gonna go ahead and call the bluff and say that at the end of the day, no ones actually going to quit Facebook for good after all is said and done. Before we all light up our pitchforks and head over to Menlo Park in anger, everyone needs to take a collective step back and look around at all the places you’ve already released the exact same data that Facebook & Cambridge Analytica are blamed with exploiting.","If there was ever a price tag on your privacy, you gave it up a long time ago.","If you want to be concerned about how someone is using your data, take a look at Google. Google tracks your location, reads your emails, recognizes the sound of your voice, and knows every search you’ve ever conducted. What exactly is Google doing with all that information? Selling it. They are selling it to their advertisers and using it to data mine everything that can be found out about you to better serve you products and tools you might consider buying.","Using a credit card allows the credit card company to know everywhere you’ve been, every item you’ve purchased and every meal you’ve eaten. What are the credit card companies doing with that information? SELLING IT.","What about loyalty cards at grocery stores? You scan every single item you purchase, demonstrating how frequent you buy certain things, what price points you are willing to pay, and how loyal you are to specific brands. What are the grocery stores doing with that information? SELLING IT.","You see a pattern here?","Your privacy has been for sale for the last 20 years, being upset now that you’ve used a free service long enough that they can tell everything about you, from the way you vote to the type of milk you buy at the store, is a waste of time.","There is no getting back the information we’ve already put out there and there is so much out there already that privacy is irrelevant. If you want true privacy, toss your phone, use only cash, and go live in a remote corner of the world.","I’d love to say that there’s some kind of resolution or a way to be better about maintain our collective privacy, but there isn’t.

We crank out the millions of posts and photos and likes and links that keep people coming back for more.","Advertisement","Then our online behaviors are captured and analyzed by Facebook and transformed into targeted campaigns that earn the company so much money.","Get Talking Points in your inbox:","An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.","So we’re entitled to some time off. Just one day ought to do it. That’s about as long as a Facebook fanatic could hold out before withdrawal symptoms set in, but it’s still long enough to make an impact.","Feb. 4 would have been an ideal day - the company’s 14th birthday. But since that day has passed, how about May 18, the day Facebook stock began trading publicly back in 2012. If enough of us refuse to log on for those 24 hours, it might get somebody’s attention.","These are dark days for the social media darling. Facebook is under investigation in the United States and United Kingdom for allowing the private data of some 50 million users to end up in the hands of a political research firm affiliated with the Trump campaign. The company had already been under intense criticism for failing to stop Russian propagandists from disrupting the 2016 election by targeting Facebook users with fake content.","These latest revelations have bolstered efforts in Congress to regulate the new generation of technology companies, fueling a backlash that has cost Facebook billions of dollars in market value in recent days.","Advertisement","Meanwhile, I’m working on self-defense strategies for preserving my privacy. As a journalist who covers the company, I won’t choose the most obvious solution and cancel my account. In fact, I think that’s a bad idea.","Having a Facebook account provides a way for friends, families, colleagues, and business prospects to track you down. It helps protect against identity thieves setting up a fake account in your name, and using it to scam your friends. Also, by occasionally posting positive messages on these accounts, you can build up a good online reputation. When people do an online search of your name, these accounts will rise to the top of the page and make you look good, or at least better.","Simply being on Facebook poses little threat to your privacy. That comes from the way you use the account. Every post, every link gives Facebook more information about you. Maybe too much. So the less you post, the safer you are.","But Facebook has many ways of keeping tabs on you. Even when you’re not on Facebook itself, the company plants cookies in your browser that can track your visits to other Internet sites and send you ads based on the places you go. I fight back with Ghostery, a browser plug-in that automatically blocks tracking cookies from Facebook, Google, and others. Some websites won’t let you in when they see you’re blocking these cookies, but for the extra privacy, it’s worth the bother.","Another way to deny the snoopers is to be selective about using apps from third parties that connect to your Facebook account. I’ve installed more than 60 such apps over the years, from companies like Amazon and Spotify that provide services through Facebook — some I used only for an hour or two and then forgot about. But the apps didn’t forget me. They keep track of my Facebook friends list, and some even monitor the messages I post, collecting data on me all along.","Advertisement","So choose these apps with care, or follow my lead and uninstall them all. It’s a tedious task, and the app makers still keep the data they’ve already collected — unless you contact them, one by one, and ask them to delete it. But one has to begin somewhere.","Then there are the major Internet sites that offer to log you in using your Facebook account. If you do that, then everything you do at that site goes into your Facebook dossier. Most such sites also let you log in with a standard e-mail address. I always choose the Facebook-free option.","If your Facebook profile is already full of questionable content, you can go in and delete items one at a time, which could take days or weeks. Or you can tell Facebook to delete your account altogether. You might even sign up later for a new account and start over. But if you choose this radical option, be sure to notify all your friends before killing the old account. That way, when you send them new friend requests, they won’t think it’s spam and ignore you.","And, of course, you should first make a copy of your old account. Facebook has a backup feature that will do this automatically and download a file to your computer.","Still, there’s no point in launching a new account if you’re just going back to your old habits. If you keep posting 10 or 20 times a day, discussing the same topics and linking to similar videos, photos, and websites, your new Facebook profile won’t differ much from the old one. And your privacy will be just as much at risk.","In the end, using Facebook compromises your privacy. But you get to decide how much."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

Kogan had paid about 270,000 people to fill out a survey built on Facebook’s developer tools — allowing him to pull information on “liked” pages, as well as look at the “friends” of users that opted into his app. The data was leveraged by Cambridge Analytica to target voters with specific personality profiles.","Pulling that information was kosher, but selling it to a third-party, like Cambridge Analytica, violated Facebook’s terms of service. Facebook has since tightened its agreement, barring app developers from looking at friends’ profiles. Facebook said on Saturday that “Kogan lied to us” by passing data collected from his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook said that when it learned of the violation in 2015, it removed Kogan’s app.","But for many users, the news highlighted the danger of Facebook housing the personal information of billions of users. Several app developers told TheWrap there is still little stopping them from violating Facebook’s terms of service and selling its data.","And even before the Cambridge Analytica news, Facebook has been grappling with its waning popularity in the U.S. The company lost 1 million domestic users last quarter — its first quarterly drop in daily users.","TheWrap isn’t telling you what to do, but if you were looking to #DeleteFacebook as well, here’s what you need to know. First off, there’s a difference between deleting and deactivating your Facebook. Deactivating essentially takes your Facebook profile off the map, but if you head back over to the social network and login, your profile will pop back up.","That’s all you need to know — but there’s a holdup. Facebook says it “may take up to 90 days from the beginning of the deletion process to delete all of the things you’ve posted, like your photos, status updates, or other data stored in backup systems.”","The Facebook co-founder purchased The New Republic in 2012, becoming executive chairman and publisher. However, he sold the venerable political magazine to Win McCormack in 2016, saying he \"underestimated the difficulty of transitioning an old and traditional institution into a digital media company in today’s quickly evolving climate.\"","The eBay founder is a well-known philanthropist who created First Look Media, a journalism venture behind The Intercept. Inspired by Edward Snowden's leaks. Omidyar teamed up with journalists Glenn Greenwald, Jeremy Scahill and Laura Poitras to launch the website “dedicated to the kind of reporting those disclosures required: fearless, adversarial journalism.”","The PayPal co-founder doesn’t own a news organization, but he makes this list because he essentially ended one -- Gawker -- proving once again the power of an angry billionaire. Thiel secretly bankrolled Hulk Hogan’s sex-tape lawsuit against Gawker Media because he was upset that the website once outed him as gay. Hogan won the defamation lawsuit against the site that sent its parent company into bankruptcy, and Gawker.com is no longer operating.","OK, so Facebook isn’t technically a news organization… yet. However, the company is preparing to launch its much-anticipated lineup of original content later this summer, and there are also signs that it's on the verge of becoming an even bigger media platform.","Campbell Brown, Head of News Partnerships at Facebook, confirmed last week it’s developing a subscription service for publishers willing to post articles directly to Facebook Instant Articles, rather than their native websites."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

(Facebook did not immediately reply to request for comment.)","Facebook has been widely criticized over the mishandled data, but the company didn’t do anything illegal, said Jamie Court, president of consumer protection group Consumer Watchdog — and that’s part of the problem.","“Unfortunately, under federal law these companies are often not held accountable for privacy violations,” he said. “They have been able to fend off legal accountability regarding the actions of third parties even when they essentially conspire with them.”","He said it is up to the Federal Trade Commission to enforce existing regulations on these companies and to Congress to pass better laws protecting consumers. (The FTC did not respond to request for comment.)","A bill passed by the House in February aims to hold websites accountable for what third parties host on their platforms. It’s one of the first to chip away at the protections big tech companies have in the U.S. Another ballot measure proposed in California for the 2018 elections requires companies to disclose exactly what data they collect and how it is handled.","Here are some measures you can take to minimize the hold it has on your privacy:","Revoke access from connected apps","When you give permission for games and other apps to access your Facebook account, third-party companies can often crawl your phone for more data, including your friends’ contact information. That’s how Cambridge Analytica allegedly retrieved the information of 50 million users from just a few hundred thousand people who opted to take a free personality quiz on Facebook.","• Click the “X” on the right of each app to revoke access to your data.","• Confirm “remove” when the window prompts you to do so.","You can also disable Facebook’s “platform” feature, which stops Facebook from integrating with games and other apps for login purposes in the future.","See what Facebook knows about you and opt out","If you live in the U.K. or the European Union, Facebook is required to let you see what information is collected on you. You can find the option to download data under settings. Even if you don’t live in a place with strict privacy laws — like the U.S., for example — Facebook lets users see what is collected on them in other ways.","Under “Facebook Ads,” users can see what information Facebook thinks it knows about them. This will include pages you’ve actually liked as well as interests the algorithm has inferred you have based on your behavior (including card games, thriller movies, and romance novels). You can remove these ads by clicking the “x” in the top right corner of each image. Although it does not stop companies from tracking you, it will make your ads less personalized.","Facebook says you can opt out of these ads under “ad settings,” but the program only allows you to opt out of around 100 specific companies, it also relies on cookies and — as privacy organization the Electronic Frontier Foundation has noted — “does not actually stop tracking,” including that allegedly carried out by Cambridge Analytica.","Limit visibility","Under “privacy settings and tools,” you can limit who sees future posts, who can send friend requests, who can see your friend list, and who can look you up using the email or phone number linked to your account. (This is especially advisable for friends who you don’t know very well.) Of course, this won’t stop Facebook from mining data from you but will limit the amount of information other users can see about you online. You can also opt out of “face recognition” under “face recognition settings.”","Turn off location services","You may want to consider opting out of location-stamping posts, especially if they are public. This won’t limit what Facebook collects on you, but can limit your visibility on the internet. Simply click the “X” next to the name of the city on your status avoid revealing where you are. Facebook’s main app as well as its Messenger app also track user location. You can turn this off on iOS under ”settings,” “location services,” and toggling them “off” for Facebook. On Android, it is under “settings,” “app,” “permissions.”","Call your elected officials","Few consumer privacy protection laws exist in the U.S., Court of Consumer Watchdog said, and those that do center on identity theft and require proof of financial damage due to an identity crime. To change that, consumers need to demand more.","“The public needs to rise up if Congress is ever going to challenge Facebook,” Court said. “The problem is politicians are elected by the same privacy violations consumers are against.”","The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocacy organization, sends out email updates on how to take action against laws that threaten consumer privacy, or use the site to look up your representative’s contact information.","Delete your account","The only way to truly get Facebook to stop tracking you is to delete your account entirely.","“If you use Facebook, the price you pay is your data,” said B.J. Mendelson, author of ‘Privacy: And How to Get it Back’ “You can’t really avoid these leaks. The change has to come through Facebook itself (and the other tech companies) or through regulation of those companies.”","Facebook allows users to deactivate an account temporarily or delete it permanently, although it does not say it will delete the data it holds on users after they go.","Follow Us","IMPORTANT NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER:","Any Company profiled on The Money\nStreet should be viewed as a paid advertisement.

That was the basis the entire company was built on,\" he told the Observer.","The data his firm used was reportedly gathered in early 2014 through an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\", which was built by a Russian-American researcher at Cambridge University called Aleksandr Kogan.","About 270,000 users agreed to have their data collected and used for academic research in exchange for a small payment. The Times reported Cambridge Analytica covered the costs of the app, more than $800,000.","However, the app not only collected personal information from the people who downloaded it, but also of unknowing friends.","Kogan provided information from more than 50 million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica, which was used by the company to create 30 million \"psychographic\" profiles that could then be used to design targeted political ads.","What happened next?","The initial reports set in motion a string of allegations and events that have been difficult to keep up with.","Investigations were launched on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed on Monday it was investigating Facebook's privacy practices. UK authorities raided Cambridge Analytica's London offices last Friday night.","Cambridge Analytica said on March 17 it deleted all data received from Kogan's company, Global Science Research (GSR), when it found out it had not been obtained in line with Facebook's policies.","\"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" it said.","Kogan, meanwhile, said he felt scapegoated by Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. \"Honestly we thought we were acting perfectly appropriately. We thought we were doing something that was really normal,\" he told the BBC last Wednesday.","Nix was suspended by his firm a day later, though in a statement the company also said the Channel 4 News report had been edited to \"grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations\".","Meanwhile, questions have been raised about Cambridge Analytica's involvement in other election campaigns.","The Observer published allegations the company had worked with people thought to be Israeli computer hackers in an unsuccessful attempt to sway the vote in Nigeria's 2015 presidential election. Others raised questions about the role of Cambridge Analytica in shaping the outcome of Kenya's disputed elections, in which Uhuru Kenyatta emerged victorious.","{articleGUID}","On Tuesday, Wylie testified before UK parliamentarians about how pro-Brexit campaigners linked to Cambridge Analytica allegedly \"cheated\" in the run-up to the referendum on leaving the EU.","His nearly four-hour testimony followed allegations by a separate whistle-blower, Shahmir Sanni, that pro-Brexit campaign groups potentially broke laws on referendum spending limits when it paid data firm AggregateIQ, which is linked to Cambridge Analytica, for digital marketing services.","AggregateIQ reportedly received 40 percent of Vote Leave's entire budget. The organisation's campaign director Dominic Cummings said after the referendum victory, \"We couldn't have done it without [AggregateIQ].\" According to the Observer, that quote was taken down from the company's website on Thursday after being contacted by journalists.","Why are people angry at Facebook?","In the days following the original reporting, the Twitter hashtag #DeleteFacebook began trending. Congress asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify on what had happened. The social media giant's share value took a dramatic dive, down $60bn at one point down.","Facebook rejected the claim that a data breach had happened. \"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" it said in a statement.","When the data harvesting was taking place, Facebook's policy allowed for the collection of friends' data by app creators and academics, though selling this data to third parties or using it for advertising was not prohibited.","In 2015, Facebook found out Kogan's company allegedly violated its policies when it passed the material on to Cambridge Analytica. In the March 16 statement, the social media company said it had been assured then that Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie had deleted the data.","Still, the Observer reported: \"At the time [Facebook] failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals\".","Kogan's app was removed from Facebook in 2015, but the social media behemoth didn't suspend Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group - the firm that serviced contracts won by Cambridge Analytica and was called \"effectively a shell\" - until March 16, four days after the Observer contacted Facebook for comment.","Zuckerberg has since apologised for what he called a \"breach of trust\" in full-page newspaper ads in several UK and US newspapers.","On Tuesday, it was reported Zuckerberg will testify before US Congress on the Cambridge Analytica leak, though he declined to answer questions from UK lawmakers.","Irrespective of Facebook's culpability, the scandal has tapped into ongoing concerns about how careful the platform is with users' data - and how the company has been used to influence political outcomes.","Facebook has been under scrutiny over whether it did enough to stop Russian propaganda aimed at influencing the US election from spreading misinformation on users' news feeds.","Reports of discontent among Facebook's ranks have emerged. In November 2016, BuzzFeed reported that Facebook employees had formed \"an unofficial task force\" to create a list of recommendations to the company's senior management about how to address the platform's fake news problem.","Back then, Zuckerberg said the idea that fake news had affected the outcome of the US election was \"a pretty crazy idea\".","This latest controversy does little to assuage fears that Facebook is unable or unwilling to prevent third parties from using it to further interests that go against those of its users."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

{"originalurl":"https://thebea.st/2GwM7qi?source=facebook&via=desktop","title":"Trump’s Publisher Pal Puts Saudi Propaganda Magazine in U.S. Supermarkets","text":["Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast","A nearly 100-page magazine published by Donald Trump’s allies at American Media Inc. is providing a different kind of celebrity gossip than the American supermarket shopper is used to seeing. It’s selling America on a fellow Trump ally, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.","MBS, as the millennial victor of last year’s Saudi palace power struggle is known, is currently on an overseas tour to cement his legitimacy. Its current stop is the United States, where MBS met last week with Trump ahead of checking the young-king-in-waiting PR boxes of Silicon Valley and Hollywood.","Greeting Americans on newsstands is a high-quality glossy advertisement for MBS, The New Kingdom. It retails for $13.99, has no ads and its 200,000 copies can be found in venues ranging from U.S. airports to WalMart, Safeway and Kroger’s—raising questions about the magazine’s financing and its origins. The Saudis say they don’t know how it came to be. AMI, which publishes The National Enquirer, insists it had no outside editorial or financial assistance, from the Trump administration or otherwise.","The New Kingdom doesn’t feature any salacious gossip about MBS, but its coverage is just as breathless. “Our Closest Middle East Ally Destroying Terrorism,” the cover coos, sidestepping decades of Saudi Arabian financial support for terrorist groups and ideologues. It Disneyfies Saudi Arabia as “the Magic Kingdom.” It’s easily the most uncritical encomium to MBS since Thomas Friedman.","In terms practically designed to appeal to Trump and his admirers, the cover lines marvel at the 32-year old “next king” who’s “Controlling Staggering $4 Trillion Business Empire” and building a “$640 Billion Sci-Fi City of the Future.” Inside is an ode to his “luxurious lifestyle,” reported $3 billion personal wealth and ownership of a 54,000-square foot palace near Versailles. MBS’ goal for his subjects is described as “spreading happiness.”","The centerpiece is a lengthy advertorial for MBS’ “Saudi Vision 2030” initiative — a huge part of which appears to be rebranding the kingdom under MBS. Not since the establishment of Saudi Arabia has the kingdom gone “through such a radical transformation,” whose economic “diversification isn’t just about protecting the rich elite,” the magazine assures. Under MBS, Saudi seeks to become “a global investment powerhouse” and a tech hub. Seven pages go to promoting MBS pet project NEOM, a $640 billion planned “utopian city the likes of which the world has never seen,” ostensibly heavy on networked devices, with a cooler temperature than the rest of Saudi Arabia – literally and metaphorically. With the exception of a ban on alcohol, NOEM, the article insists, will have “a more benign attitude toward what is acceptable and what is not in terms of dress and behavior.”","All this includes emphasizing, as MBS often does, “New Rights for Saudi Women,” such as the ability to drive and attend coed Yanni performances. Behind the heavily promoted gender liberalization program is “of course: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.”","Unmentioned in The New Kingdom is Saudi Arabia’s system of male guardianship, a literal patriarchal tool that requires male relatives to provide women “permission,” Human Rights Watch pointed out, for everything from obtaining an apartment, filing legal claims, obtaining a passport, being released from prison and, in some cases, “to work or access healthcare.” (Or, as The New Kingdom puts it, women “have traditionally taken a back seat to men.”)","Other things not mentioned in the magazine: Saudi Arabia’s massive number of executions, which are conducted by stoning and even Islamic State-like public beheadings. You can see a gorgeous pictorial spread of desert-striding oryx and an adorable hamadryas baboon (“With national protection, many of the land’s majestic, formerly troubled species are thriving once again,” we learn) but read nothing about the three-year-old war Saudi Arabia is conducting in Yemen, under Defense Minister MBS, that has led the United Nations to warn of a widespread famine. The typically unbylined articles refer to MBS’ “sweeping crackdown on corruption resulting in the arrest of some of the country’s most powerful figures” but neglect the part where they had to sign over shares in their companies, their properties and even cash to get out of their gilded hotel-prison. (Even as an article boasts that MBS is “said to control almost all of the kingdom’s wealth.”)","But if the magazine sidles past the less comfortable aspects of Saudi Arabia’s counterterrorism and human rights records, it is firmly comfortable exalting the partnership between MBS and Donald Trump.","There are five pictures of Trump – including one of MBS shaking the president’s hand, placed adjacent to one of a beaming MBS greeting Vladimir Putin. Only cover boy MBS, with eleven, has more photos. Here is Trump triumphant in his May visit to Riyadh. Here is Trump, flanked by wife Melania and octogenarian King Salman. Here is Trump in that orb photo. MBS is quoted describing Trump as “a president who will bring America back on the right track.”","“There are five pictures of Trump . Only cover boy MBS, with eleven, has more photos.”","For good measure, MBS also appears photographed beside Bill Gates, Xi Jinping, Shinzo Abe and a giggly U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He’s a world leader “poised to spread modernism throughout his kingdom,” the copy reads. An article with no byline hails his “ambitious and unprecedented plan to bring economic, social and religious change to the traditionally conservative country.” It treats MBS’ ascendance to the throne – something secured through what the Guardian called a “slow-motion coup” – as a fait accompli, writing that “senior sources in Saudi [are] expecting him to assume the throne within the year.”","“We will not continue to be in the post-’79 era – that age is over,” MBS promises on the inside cover. That quote, functionally an epigram for the magazine, is an ambiguous reference to two seismic regional developments in 1979.","In November of 1979, Islamist militants seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca, an act that challenged the legitimacy of the House of Saud. With French and Pakistani aid, the ruling family recovered the mosque and then accommodated Wahhabist fundamentalism at home and exported it abroad – most immediately, in support of the insurgency against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The second critical development in 1979 is the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia’s principal enemy and, alongside oil, the adhesive of the U.S.-Saudi alliance for the last four decades.","The impression left with a reader is that MBS is unwilling to tolerate either. The New Kingdom cites an interview with the Guardian, conducted by its aggressive Mideast correspondent Martin Chulov, where MBS pledges: “What happened in the last 30 years is not Saudi Arabia. What happened in the region in the last 30 years is not the Middle East. After the Iranian revolution in 1979, people wanted to copy this model in different countries, one of them is Saudi Arabia. We didn’t know how to deal with it. And the problem spread all over the world. Now is the time to get rid of it.”","Most of the articles are unbylined. The exception is a piece attributed to Kacy Grine, a financial adviser to one of the world’s richest men, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, whom MBS imprisoned in the Ritz-Carlton for 83 days. Accompanying it is a photo of Grine standing to the right of a beaming President Trump inside the Oval Office. Grine wants you to think of Saudi Arabia not as Diet ISIS, but as a capitalist powerhouse for the 21st century.","Grine encourages you to think of Saudi Arabia “by picturing a start-up.” In a short, buzzword-filled article with the flavor of an investor prospectus, Grine pitches a Saudi-centered “United Arabic Market,” phasing out a reliance on oil exports (“data is the new oil” “Now it’s time for a new deal – with content providers and based on data”) and essentially expanding the House of Saud’s holdings into economic sway over a billion Arabs. And not just them. Grine explicitly urges Saudi Arabia to “acquire strategic stakes in U.S. tech, media, sports and entertainment companies.”","A common market is usually the sort of thing that disgusts Trump’s nationalist base, but Grine doesn’t reckon with that. “The new Saudi-led United Arabic Market could be positioned between China and Europe,” he enthuses instead, “offering an open market (Europe-like) with monopolistic positions through a robust architecture without a constraining antitrust regulation (China-like).”","With similar euphemism, Grine assures readers that Saudi Arabia isn’t hung up on the whole Israel thing. Seven decades of “missed opportunities” for “the Palestinian cause” can be mitigated by a unified market that “could build economic relations with Israel and form a new Palestinian generation willing to create a brighter and more sustainable future for Palestine.” Left unaddressed is the central question of Palestinian political independence from under Israeli occupation, a question whose urgency is compounded now that at least one Israeli Army survey has found more Arabs than Jews live in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. That elision mirrors the one widely expected to feature in the as-yet-unveiled “peace plan” authored by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and the American version of MBS.","The magazine features no advertisements and comes with a hefty cover price, with a display notice lasting until early June, long after MBS’ American visit ends in April. The Saudis denied playing any role in financing the publication, and view it as something of a surprise.","“Neither the Embassy nor any other part of the Saudi Government commissioned this, and we don't know who did,” said Embassy spokeswoman Fatimah Baeshen.","A State Department spokesperson was “unaware of any involvement on State’s part” in the production of the magazine and referred The Daily Beast to the White House, which did not respond to repeated inquiries. Neither did the Trump Organization.","AMI, for its part, insisted it had no outside help for the publication. A spokesperson compared its decision to publish the fawning magazine to special issues it devoted to “The Royals, Elvis, The Kennedys, The Olympics, etc,” all of which are vastly better known to American audiences than a 32-year-old Saudi royal.","“Publishing this Special Interest Publication was a business decision made by AMI. AMI timed this special issue to coincide and capitalize on the news coverage surrounding the Crown Prince's arrival and reports that he would meet with President Trump and visit U.S. Executives,” a statement provided to The Daily Beast read, even though MBS’ U.S. tour has hardly generated blanket coverage, with the notable exception of a 60 Minutes interview. Plus, the magazine isn’t just about MBS. Substantial chunks of it is about Saudi Arabia itself – its history, its topography, its horse racing and falcon breeding, its cities, and its cuisine.","“No one, outside of American Media Inc., its business executives and its editorial staff, had any influence on this publication or its content,” an AMI spokesperson told The Daily Beast."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}
{"originalurl":"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/cambridge-analytica-facebook-quiz.html","title":"Opinion | Cambridge Analytica and the Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz - The New York Times","text":["Cambridge Analytica and the Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz","Do you panic easily? Do you often feel blue? Do you have a sharp tongue? Do you get chores done right away? Do you believe in the importance of art?","If ever you’ve answered questions like these on one of the free personality quizzes floating around Facebook, you’ll have learned what’s known as your Ocean score: How you rate according to the big five psychological traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. You may also be responsible the next time America is shocked by an election upset.","For several years, a data firm eventually hired by the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica, has been using Facebook as a tool to build psychological profiles that represent some 230 million adult Americans. A spinoff of a British consulting company and sometime-defense contractor known for its counterterrorism “psy ops” work in Afghanistan, the firm does so by seeding the social network with personality quizzes. Respondents — by now hundreds of thousands of us, mostly female and mostly young but enough male and older for the firm to make inferences about others with similar behaviors and demographics — get a free look at their Ocean scores. Cambridge Analytica also gets a look at their scores and, thanks to Facebook, gains access to their profiles and real names.","Cambridge Analytica worked on the “Leave” side of the Brexit campaign. In the United States it takes only Republicans as clients: Senator Ted Cruz in the primaries, Mr. Trump in the general election. Cambridge is reportedly backed by Robert Mercer, a hedge fund billionaire and a major Republican donor; a key board member is Stephen K. Bannon, the head of Breitbart News who became Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman and is set to be his chief strategist in the White House.","In the age of Facebook, it has become far easier for campaigners or marketers to combine our online personas with our offline selves, a process that was once controversial but is now so commonplace that there’s a term for it, “onboarding.” Cambridge Analytica says it has as many as 3,000 to 5,000 data points on each of us, be it voting histories or full-spectrum demographics — age, income, debt, hobbies, criminal histories, purchase histories, religious leanings, health concerns, gun ownership, car ownership, homeownership — from consumer-data giants.","No data point is very informative on its own, but profiling voters, says Cambridge Analytica, is like baking a cake. “It’s the sum of the ingredients,” its chief executive officer, Alexander Nix, told NBC News. Because the United States lacks European-style restrictions on second- or thirdhand use of our data, and because our freedom-of-information laws give data brokers broad access to the intimate records kept by local and state governments, our lives are open books even without social media or personality quizzes.","Ever since the advertising executive Lester Wunderman coined the term “direct marketing” in 1961, the ability to target specific consumers with ads — rather than blanketing the airwaves with mass appeals and hoping the right people will hear them — has been the marketer’s holy grail. What’s new is the efficiency with which individually tailored digital ads can be tested and matched to our personalities. Facebook is the microtargeter’s ultimate weapon.","The explosive growth of Facebook’s ad business has been overshadowed by its increasing role in how we get our news, real or fake. In July, the social network posted record earnings: quarterly sales were up 59 percent from the previous year, and profits almost tripled to $2.06 billion. While active users of Facebook — now 1.71 billion monthly active users — were up 15 percent, the real story was how much each individual user was worth. The company makes $3.82 a year from each global user, up from $2.76 a year ago, and an average of $14.34 per user in the United States, up from $9.30 a year ago. Much of this growth comes from the fact that advertisers not only have an enormous audience in Facebook but an audience they can slice into the tranches they hope to reach.","One recent advertising product on Facebook is the so-called “dark post”: A newsfeed message seen by no one aside from the users being targeted. With the help of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Trump’s digital team used dark posts to serve different ads to different potential voters, aiming to push the exact right buttons for the exact right people at the exact right times.","Imagine the full capability of this kind of “psychographic” advertising. In future Republican campaigns, a pro-gun voter whose Ocean score ranks him high on neuroticism could see storm clouds and a threat: The Democrat wants to take his guns away. A separate pro-gun voter deemed agreeable and introverted might see an ad emphasizing tradition and community values, a father and son hunting together.","In this election, dark posts were used to try to suppress the African-American vote. According to Bloomberg, the Trump campaign sent ads reminding certain selected black voters of Hillary Clinton’s infamous “super predator” line. It targeted Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood with messages about the Clinton Foundation’s troubles in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Federal Election Commission rules are unclear when it comes to Facebook posts, but even if they do apply and the facts are skewed and the dog whistles loud, the already weakening power of social opprobrium is gone when no one else sees the ad you see — and no one else sees “I’m Donald Trump, and I approved this message.”","While Hillary Clinton spent more than $140 million on television spots, old-media experts scoffed at Trump’s lack of old-media ad buys. Instead, his campaign pumped its money into digital, especially Facebook. One day in August, it flooded the social network with 100,000 ad variations, so-called A/B testing on a biblical scale, surely more ads than could easily be vetted by human eyes for compliance with Facebook’s “community standards.”","Perhaps out of necessity, the Trump team was embracing a new-media lesson: It didn’t have to build everything from scratch. Mark Zuckerberg and others had already built the infrastructure the campaign needed to reach voters directly. When “Trump TV” went live on Facebook before and after the second debate it raked in $9 million in donations in 120 minutes.","In the immediate wake of Mr. Trump’s surprise election, so many polls and experts were so wrong that it became fashionable to declare that big data was dead. But it isn’t, not when its most obvious avatar, Facebook, was so crucial to victory.","On Monday, after a similar announcement from Google, Facebook said it would no longer allow fake-news websites to show ads, on their own sites, from Facebook’s ad network — a half-step that neither blocks what appears on your newsfeed nor affects how advertisers can microtarget users on the social network.","There are surely more changes to come. Mr. Zuckerberg is young, still skeptical that his radiant transparency machine could be anything but a force for good, rightly wary of policing what the world’s diverse citizens say and share on his network, so far mostly dismissive of Facebook’s role in the election. If Mr. Zuckerberg takes seriously his oft-stated commitments to diversity and openness, he must grapple honestly with the fact that Facebook is no longer just a social network. It’s an advertising medium that’s now dangerously easy to weaponize.","A Trump administration is unlikely to enforce transparency about who is targeted by dark posts and other hidden political ads — or to ensure that politicians take meaningful ownership of what the ads say. But Facebook can.","McKenzie Funk, an Open Society fellow, is a founding member of the journalism cooperative Deca and the author of “Windfall: The Booming Business of Global Warming.”","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SR5 of the New York edition with the headline: The Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz.

The social media giant has grown exponentially since the last presidential election, rendering it for the first time a major campaigning tool that has the potential to transform friendship into a political weapon.","Facebook is also being seen as a source of invaluable data on voters. The re-election team, Obama for America, will be inviting its supporters to log on to the campaign website via Facebook, thus allowing the campaign to access their personal data and add it to the central data store – the largest, most detailed and potentially most powerful in the history of political campaigns. If 2008 was all about social media, 2012 is destined to become the \"data election\".","\"Facebook is now ubiquitous,\" says Dan Siroker, a former Google digital analyst who joined Obama's campaign in 2008 and now runs his own San Francisco-based analytics consultancy, Optimizely. \"Whichever candidate uses Facebook the most effectively could win the war.\"","For the past nine months a crack team of some of America's top data wonks has occupied an entire floor of the Prudential building in Chicago devising a digital campaign from the bottom up. The team draws much of its style and inspiration from the corporate sector, with its driving ambition to create a vote-garnering machine that is smooth, unobtrusive and ruthlessly efficient.","Already more than 100 geeks, some recruited at top-flight university job fairs including Stanford, are assembled in the Prudential drawn from an array of disciplines: statisticians, predictive modellers, data mining experts, mathematicians, software engineers, bloggers, internet advertising experts and online organisers.","At the core is a single beating heart – a unified computer database that gathers and refines information on millions of committed and potential Obama voters. The database will allow staff and volunteers at all levels of the campaign – from the top strategists answering directly to Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina to the lowliest canvasser on the doorsteps of Ohio – to unlock knowledge about individual voters and use it to target personalised messages that they hope will mobilise voters where it counts most.","Every time an individual volunteers to help out – for instance by offering to host a fundraising party for the president – he or she will be asked to log onto the re-election website with their Facebook credentials. That in turn will engage Facebook Connect, the digital interface that shares a user's personal information with a third party.","Consciously or otherwise, the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they store publicly on their Facebook page – home location, date of birth, interests and, crucially, network of friends – directly into the central Obama database.","\"If you log in with Facebook, now the campaign has connected you with all your relationships,\" a digital campaign organiser who has worked on behalf of Obama says.","The potential benefits of the strategy can already be felt. The Obama campaign this year has attracted about 1.3 million donors, 98% of whom have contributed $250 or less – that's more than double the number at the same stage in 2008. At this rate, Obama is also well on the way towards staging the world's first billion-dollar campaign.","Under its motto \"Bigger, better, 2012\", the Chicago team intends between now and election day in November to create a campaign powerhouse which will allow fundraisers, advertisers and state and local organisers to draw from the same data source.","Joe Rospars, the campaign's chief digital strategist, told a seminar at the Guardian-sponsored Social Media Week that the aim was to create technology that encourages voters to get involved, in tune with Obama's emphasis on community organising.","Campaign insiders say that the emphasis this year will be on efficiency more than any headline-grabbing technical wizardry. But that should not obscure how significant this year's presidential cycle will be in putting to the test the first custom-made digital campaign.","Mark Sullivan, founder of Voter Activation Network, which manages the Democratic party's central database of voter information known as Vote Builder, says that \"what we will see in 2012 will make 2008 look really primitive\".","Judith Freeman of New Organizing Institute, who worked on both John Kerry's 2004 and Obama's 2008 presidential campaigns, says there is a leap forward in technology every presidential cycle, and 2012 would be no exception. \"There's a deadline – it's got to be done by election day – and that provides a huge push to make things happen.\"","In 2008 the Obama digital team was lauded around the world for its groundbreaking work on internet fundraising. Yet in fact, the separation of its data on voters into several distinct silos forced high-level staffers to spend hours manually downloading information from one database to another.","The Obama team in 2008 did a good job in beginning to tear down those walls, releasing extraordinary fundraising energy in the process that raised about $500m online.","This year the Chicago team hasn't knocked down the walls so much as dispensed with them altogether. They have built from the ground up a unified database that incorporates and connects everything the campaign knows about a voter within it.","Rospars said that in 2012 they no longer had to try to integrate data in the campaign. \"We are just one campaign now – we built it from scratch.\"","The centralised nature of the database may raise privacy issues as the election cycle progresses. Jeff Chester of the digital advertising watchdog Center for Digital Democracy, which has been calling for regulators to review the growth of digital marketing in politics, said that \"this is beyond J Edgar Hoover's dream. In its rush to exploit the power of digital data to win re-election, the Obama campaign appears to be ignoring the ethical and moral implications.\"","But from the vantage point of the campaign the benefits are evident.","\"Fusing your data into one central store is cheaper, quicker and allows you to be more targeted,\" said Jim Pugh, who was part of Obama's 2008 digital team and now works for the progressive online movement, Rebuild the Dream.","The Obama database incorporates Vote Builder, a store of essential information such as age, postal address, occupation and voting history drawn from the voter files of 190 million active voters. It lines up and matches those voter files with data gathered from online interactions with the president's supporters – notably the millions of pieces of information its army of canvassers collected across the nation during the 2008 race, a list of email addresses of supporters that it has amassed and that now stands at about 23 million, as well as the contact information of Obama's 25 million Facebook fans.","Facebook itself has been transformed as a political campaign tool since 2008, simply by dint of its exponential growth. Four years ago there were about 40 million Facebook users in the US; now there are more than 160 million – incorporating almost the entire voting public.","The significance of the fusion of Facebook and voter file data is hard to overemphasise. \"This is the Moneyball moment for politics,\" says Sam Graham-Felsen, Obama's chief blogger in 2008. \"If you can figure out how to leverage the power of friendship, that opens up incredible possibilities.\"","First among those possibilities is that the campaign can distribute customised content designed specifically for its Facebook fans to share with their much wider circle of friends. The messages can be honed to a particular demographic – age, gender, etc – as well as set of interests, and targeted on the most hotly contested parts of the most crucial battleground states.","\"Influencers\" – those people who tend to act as thought leaders among their friends on Facebook – can be identified and prioritised.","Teddy Goff, the digital director of the re-election team, told Social Media Week that as the year progresses there would be more and more \"persuasion through interaction\".","Individual voters would be given access to digital platforms from which they will be able to tell their own stories \"and that's far more powerful than anything we can say\", Goff said. \"That will be the story of this election. People's own stories really moves votes.\"","Goff said the campaign was focused on building relationships through social media. An Obama message would be crafted so that \"not only can it be passed to your friends but to those friends that we think are most in need of passing it on to\".","The bottom line is that if you are sent a message from your Facebook friend encouraging you to turn up to an event or donate to Obama, you are vastly more likely to respond than if the request comes from an anonymous campaign staffer.","The other door that data integration will further open in 2012 is personalised marketing. This has been the Holy Grail of political campaigners for decades: the idea that you can talk directly to voters and serve them customised messages.","In the old world of snail mail, that could be achieved to some degree through direct marketing – ie leaflets dropped into the letter box – but that is expensive and far too slow with today's 24-hour news cycle.","The fusion of information into a centralised database allows you to direct market online at much less cost and virtually instantaneously.","The technique has begun to spread widely among commercial businesses over the past year, and it is only a matter of time before such hyper-targeting is standard across political campaigns. Indeed, we've already started to see it this year.","The Obama campaign has already tailored a single donation request to 26 distinct segments of the voting public. The Republicans are also getting in on the act.","Michele Bachmann used customised online advertising in Iowa to reach Republican voters only, sending to their computers messages with a local spin for each of the state's 99 counties. That helped her win Iowa's vaunted straw poll in August 2011 (though that didn't help her in the long run). Rick Perry sent God-praising commercials to Iowans who listed themselves as evangelicals on Facebook.","The company CampaignGrid, that serves mainly Republican candidates, claims to be able to online market direct to targeted households. It has an integrated database on 110 million voters across America – some 65% of the electorate – to whom it can serve personalised ads, following them wherever they are browsing on the internet.","Jeff Dittus, the company's co-founder, illustrates what this means. He worked on behalf of one unidentified Republican presidential candidate, serving online ads in the Miami-Dade region of Florida specifically to 400,000 individuals who had voted in at least two of the four previous Republican primaries. The adverts were further customised for gender, and for Spanish speaking.","They were distributed to the individuals through internet ad exchanges that allow for instantaneous filtering of users the nanosecond they click onto a video on any one of four million websites. In that flash, if you fitted the criterion you were served with a 30-second pre-roll video from the candidate delivering a message to you that you would have found remarkably personal.","\"I'm sure this is the future of digital political campaigning,\" said CampaignGrid's CEO Jeff Dittus.","Drew Brighton, CEO of TargetSmart Communications, is hoping to do the same hyper-targeting for Democratic and progressive politicians and causes through his new product Target Blue. It matches up the details of up to 50m cookies embedded on individual computers with voter files and uses it to identify Democratic-leaning individuals to whom it can serve customised ads wherever they go on the web.","The company is also developing a system for targeting Democratic voters through their computer IP addresses down to such tightly drawn areas or \"IP zones\" as just 20 households. That allows for micro-targeting depending on the average income bracket, age profile and concerns of that tiny locality.","The elephant in the room, of course, is television, which continues to dominate advertising spending by political campaigns. Most analysts agree that 2012 has come too soon for any equally transformative leaps forward in targeted or \"addressable\" TV advertising.","Cable television can close in on geographic zones ranging from a few thousand to up to 100,000 viewers allowing campaigns to shape their messages to those clusters. The tighter the geographical area that can be drawn, the more efficient the TV advertising becomes as campaign managers can focus on primarily-Democratic, Republican or independent neighbourhoods.","But its still a relatively blunt instrument. The prize would be to be able to fuse cable subscriptions with voter files so that TV adverts could be sent to households of a specific political persuasion.","Technically, that's already possible. Comcast Spotlight, the advertising arm of Comcast Cable, has run trials of commercial as opposed to political addressable advertising in Baltimore. Adverts custom-made to speak to various demographic groups were piped into 60,000 identified households, though the personal details were removed to protect privacy. The results confirmed the power of the technology: homes receiving addressable adverts tuned away a third less of the time than homes receiving untargeted commercials.","Dan Sinagoga, who specialises in political advertising at Comcast Spotlight, says that all advertisers, but political ones in particular, \"would like to be doing addressable advertising yesterday\". But he said it was unlikely to happen in any great quantity in 2012 as there are too many hurdles, including concerns in Washington about the privacy of cable TV consumers.","No such impediment will hold back the digital explosion this year. As an Obama insider puts it: \"Give us less wood, and we'll make more fire.\""],"isopubdate":"2012-02-17"}

Economists no longer see 3 percent growth forecasts for the current quarter. Recent real estate and retail sales data raise questions about what is going on with the consumer, and there is concern Fed interest rate hikes could slow things down even more.","In the very near term, investors are looking to the Fed for guidance. The Federal Open Market Committee begins a two-day meeting Tuesday and will release new economic and interest rate forecasts Wednesday. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates, but the future course of rate hikes is unclear, and analysts say the reaction in stocks could be negative if the Fed expects more than the three rate hikes it currently forecasts for this year.","\"We don't see any reason for an abatement of this market pressure coming on before the Fed. After the Fed, we'll have to see what their message is,\" said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG. \"The [White House] personnel turnover at the margin increases uncertainty, and markets dislike uncertainty. There are so many uncertainties right now —politically, economically, monetarily.\"","The Dow was down more than 335 points to 24,610, and the S&P 500 was off 1.4 percent to 2,712. The S&P broke below its 50-day moving average at 2,748 and was still about a dozen points above its 100-day moving average, at 2,688.","U.S. interest rates, meanwhile, continued to rise Monday. Typically, Treasury yields fall when stocks sell off, because investors seek safety in the bond market. Instead, the 2-year yield reached a new nine-year high of 2.32 percent early Monday, and the 10-year yield also rose, to around 2.85 percent.","Facebook was the far bigger weight on the market than rising rates, but analysts said Trump also spooked the market. Analysts pointed to a weekend flurry of tweets from the president attacking the integrity of special prosecutor Robert Mueller's investigation.","\"Trump is one tweet away from scaring the hell out of the market,\" said Art Cashin, UBS' director of floor operations.","The fact that it was Facebook and tech that led the decline hit right at the sweet spot of the market. Tech was the sector that led the market off its February lows, and the Nasdaq was the only index that had recovered to the point where it was again setting new highs. Facebook and other members of FANG — Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix — were an even bigger driver.","\"The FANG thing is the biggest worry, that all these high-tech stocks which were potentially subject to some form of regulation are now wide open to some form of regulation,\" Cashin said.","Facebook's stock tumbled after news this weekend that Cambridge Analytica obtained data on millions of its users. The firm had worked on Facebook ads for the Trump campaign. Facebook's trouble spread across tech, and the sector led the selling.","\"When that rolls over it does take the market over. Unfortunately, we're in no man's land on the S&P 500. We broke the 50-day, and the 100-day is not within shouting distance,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. \"That's what we bounced off of the last time. That may be enough for people to say we're retesting the lows. When you break the 50-day, it tends to be self-fulfilling.\" The S&P hit an intraday low of 2,532 during February's sell-off.","Nasdaq was hit hard Monday, with the tech-driven composite down 2.4 percent, at about 7,300.","Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said tech signaled it was ready for a sell-off last week. This happened when the PowerShares QQQ Trust, an ETF representing the Nasdaq 100, had a negative outside day, meaning it hit a lower low than the prior day and then remained weak. But Facebook stock had looked to be strengthening ahead of the surprise weekend news.","Emanuel said the tech sector is also in the crosshairs of the trade issues and the Fed. The Trump administration has taken aggressive steps, slapping new tariffs on steel and aluminum and threatening to put tariffs on a range of Chinese goods. Analysts fear a retaliatory backlash that will hurt the sale of U.S. goods in overseas markets and potentially even slow global growth if it becomes widespread. Traders were watching headlines on Monday from Argentina, where G-20 finance ministers were critical of U.S. tariffs.","\"A higher interest rate environment should punish higher multiple stocks relatively more. They're also the biggest exporters. The average technology company is well in excess of 50 percent of an exporter, as opposed to the rest of the S&P 500,\" Emanuel said.","James Paulsen, the Leuthold Group's chief investment strategist, said the market's reliance on tech is in some ways similar to tech before the bubble burst in 2000. \"What happens in a bull market is everyone eventually tilts toward aggressives and avoids defensives. ... Everyone is going into the same popular stocks that have worked and avoided the ones that haven't, and everyone is riding the same wave,\" he said.","Paulsen expects choppiness to continue until valuations come down to more normal levels. He said there could either be a quick panicky sell-off or the market could trade sideways with volatility for months.","\"Right now, it puts you at 2,300 or below,\" he said. But if earnings rise as expected, by year-end, the S&P should be at about 2,550 then."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

As of May 2016, the only countries to ban access around the clock to the social networking site are China, Iran, and North Korea. However, since the vast majority of North Korean residents do not have access to the internet, China and Iran are the only countries where access to Facebook is actively restricted in a wholesale manner.","Bangladesh (like Iran, China and North Korea) had banned Facebook before - the Bangladeshi ban operated for a short period of time[when?]. The Awami League-led government of Bangladesh announced a countrywide ban on Facebook and other social-network websites. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina (in office from 2009) proposed the establishment of an Internet monitoring committee with the help of Bangladesh's intelligence services. Right-wing political parties and groups in Bangladesh protested against bloggers and others they had considered \"blasphemous\" at the time of the proposal. Extremists in the country had murdered eight secularists , including atheist blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, who was fatally stabbed in February 2013. National riots over the country's war-crimes trials resulted in the deaths of 56 people between 19 January 2013 and 2 March 2013.","On 18 November 2015 the same Awami League government banned Facebook again on the eve of the final judgement of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami leader Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid and Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Salauddin Kader Chowdhury. Both the politicians and previous minister have been issued a death sentence by the War Criminals Tribunal and the review board of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has finally given their judgement in favour of the previously given one.","The Bangladesh government lifted the ban on 20 December 2015. Facebook is accessible in Bangladesh as of late 2017.","As of 20 August 2013, there have been reports of Facebook being partially unblocked in China.[7] However, according to the \"Blocked in China\" website, Facebook is still blocked.[8] Facebook is not blocked in Hong Kong and Macau.","In July 2011, authorities in Germany began to discuss the prohibition of events organized on Facebook. The decision is based on numerous cases of overcrowding by people who were not originally invited.[10] In one instance, 1,600 \"guests\" attended the 16th birthday party for a Hamburg girl who accidentally posted the invitation for the event as public. After reports of overcrowding, more than a hundred police were deployed for crowd control. A police officer was injured and eleven participants were arrested for assault, property damage and resistance to authorities.[11] In another unexpectedly overcrowded event, 41 young people were arrested and at least 16 injured.[12]","In 2015, during the European migrant crisis with large numbers of immigrants entering the country unregulated, a broad discussion about the problems of mass immigration and politics of the actual government took place in social media. Early in 2016, a Bertelsmann company called \"Arvato\" was mandated to erase comments and contents from Facebook.[13] In the summer of 2016, police in fourteen German states began coordinated raids on the residences of individuals who praised the Nazi regime or referred to refugees as \"scum\" in a private Facebook group.[14] A law known as NetzDG went into effect starting in 2018 which mandates all websites in Germany, including Facebook, censor such illegal content.[15] A spokesperson for Facebook announced the company's opposition to the law on the grounds that it would lead to overblocking.[16]","The Hungarian government doesn't want to ban pages, but Facebook itself decided to ban a conservative website. Nobody can write posts or private messages if it contains the string \"kuruc.info\" or link to this conservative website.","The Indian government imposed a six-month ban on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites in (military held) Kashmir Valley in 2016-17, due to public safety because the Indian government believed social media were being misused by anti-national and anti-social elements backed by Pakistan Army and Pakistan intelligence agencies including Inter-Services Intelligence. The ban was also placed to cut communication between the rebels, who were countering the efforts made by the Indian Army.","India also posed three day ban on Facebook and other social sites during the riots in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh regarding Baba Ram Rahim Sing. [17]","After the 2009 election in Iran, the website was banned because of fears that opposition movements were being organized on the website.[3] However, after four years of the blocking of Facebook website, as of September 2013, the blocking of both Twitter and Facebook was thought to have been lifted without notice.[18]\nIranians lost unrestricted access to Facebook and Twitter the next day, leaving many people wondering whether the opening was deliberate or the result of some technical glitch.[19]","In September 2016, the Cabinet of Israel has said to have agreed with Facebook to remove content that is deemed as incitement.[20][21][22] This announcement came after top Facebook officials met with the Israeli government to determine which Facebook accounts should be deleted on the grounds that they constituted as incitement. The Israeli interior minister's office has said that they agreed with Facebook representatives to create teams that would figure out how best to monitor and remove \"inflammatory content\" online. Critics of Israels policies are not happy with this move as they claim this is being used as a way to silence outspoken Palestinian civilians, activists and journalists. The activists argue that when they post material meant to critique alleged occupation, Israel sees it as encouraging violence.[23]","The Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA) of Mauritius, ordered internet service providers of the country to ban Facebook on immediate effect, on the 8 November 2007 because of a fake profile page of the Prime Minister. Access to Facebook was restored on the next day.[24][25][26]","In April 2016, North Korea started blocking Facebook, \"a move underscoring its concern with the spread of online information,\" according to The Associated Press. Anyone who tries to access it, even with special permission from the North Korean government, will be subject to punishment.[4]","On May 19, 2010, Lahore High Court ordered Facebook to be blocked. Facebook was blocked until May 31 after a competition page encouraged users to post drawings of Muhammad. The controversial page named “Draw Muhammad Day” had been created by a Facebook user in response to American cartoonist Molly Noris’s protest to the decision of US television channel, Comedy Central to cancel an episode of the popular show “South Park” over its depiction of Mohammed. Noris had however disavowed having declared May 20 “Draw Muhammad Day” and had condemned the effort and issued an apology. The ban, implemented by the PTA, also resulted in a ban on YouTube and restricted access to other websites, including Wikipedia.[citation needed]","On 25 November 2017, the NetBlocks internet shutdown observatory and Digital Rights Foundation collected evidence of nationwide blocking of Facebook alongside other social media services, imposed by the government in response to the violent Tehreek-e-Labaik protests.[29][30][31] The technical investigation found that all major Pakistani fixed-line and mobile service providers were affected by the restrictions, which were lifted by the PTA the next day when protests abated following the resignation of Minister for Law and JusticeZahid Hamid.[32] Other websites including Twitter, YouTube and Dailymotion were also reportedly blocked by order of the PTA.[33]","In March 2018, Facebook was blocked in Sri Lanka due to racial hate speeches being rumored around the country via the social media which has caused many riots in the country by extremist groups. However this decision is not permanent.[34][35]","The Syrian government explained their ban by claiming the website promoted attacks on authorities.[36][37] The government also feared Israeli infiltration of Syrian social networks on Facebook.[36] Facebook was also used by Syrian citizens to criticize the government of Syria, as public criticism of the Syrian government used to be punishable by imprisonment.[36] In February 2011, Facebook was un-blocked from all ISP's and the website remains to be accessible.[38]","In the United Kingdom on April 28, 2011, the day before the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, a number of politically motivated Facebook groups and pages were removed or suspended from the website as part of a nationwide crackdown on political activity. The groups and pages were mostly concerned with opposition to government spending cuts, and many were used to organize demonstrations in a continuation of the 2010 UK student protests.[40][41][42] The censorship of the pages coincided with a series of pre-emptive arrests of known activists.[43] Amongst the arrestees were a street theater group planning an effigy beheading performance in opposition to the monarchy.[44]","A Facebook spokesman said the pages were disabled as part of a routine sweep because they were created with fake personal profiles, a violation of the company’s term of service. In this case a number of the Facebook personal profile pages represented causes, rather than real people. Facebook \"offered to help convert the profiles to pages that are designed to represent companies, groups or causes.\"[42] The spokesman went on to say that \"the Met Police did not ask Facebook to take down this content.\"[41]","In March 2018, fascist far-right hate group Britain First, was removed by Facebook. The pages of the leaders of the party were also taken down following their arrest and incarceration.","^Safi, Michael (March 14, 2018). \"Sri Lanka accuses Facebook over hate speech after deadly riots\".

Others have never been in print — until now.","The raciest of the photos shows Melania lying nude in a bed as Scandinavian model Emma Eriksson, also naked, embraces her from behind, just below her breasts, which are fully exposed.","In another photo, Eriksson wears sheer stockings, a low-cut bustier, high heels and a long robe — all designed by John Galliano — and raises a whip as if preparing to spank Melania, who pretends to recoil. Melania is more conservatively dressed in a skin-tight gown and high heels.","“I always loved women together, because I have been with a lot of women who desired the ménage à trois,” said Jarl Ale de Basseville, the French fashion photographer who snapped the pictures.","Melania Trump (right) poses for the January 1997 issue of Max Magazine.Jarl Ale de Basseville","“This is beauty and not porn.

Let’s start with Bezo’s, like Walmart, he is putting mom and pop businesses out of business. Like Microsoft did, he can sell things like books at a lose, put a Barnes and Nobel out of business and then raise prices as he wishes. Walmart did that to many textile manufactures by putting out cheap goods at a cheap price. Walmart effectively put thousands of people out of business and hundreds of thousands employees with it. Walmart did not stop there, they got into the pharmacy business and put thousands of local pharmacies out of business. Bezo’s is doing the same thing, book stores and the like. Companies like Macy’s are closing stores left and right and with it, jobs. Not everyone wants to buy cloths or books on line, we need both. The problem is that Amazon is effectively doing what China does, sells cheap, even sometimes at a lose.","Zuckerberg and Google are taking people’s on line information and sell it or use it to solicit, report and maneuver a persons personal information. This is illegal, not to boot Google’s misinformation on people. Google is so bad with invading people’s personal life, that they were banned from doing it in Europe. Why hasn’t America followed suit? It is because big lobby groups have the politicians in there pockets, ( See my No BULL WITH RAGING ROBERT EARLIER TODAY) . Facebook, Zuckerberg, Google and Amazon are effectively breaking the law. We all know about Zuckerberg, how he screwed the twins up at Harvard to start Facebook, plus he screwed his partner. He is a very bad guy.","The internet is killing our kids as well.

He’s an old-school businessman who sees the world in terms of tangible assets: real estate, physical mail delivery, Main Street, grocery stores.

There is no evidence that it or SCL were involved in the SoftBank situation, but it’s hard not to think about how digital espionage in the political sphere could be applied to the corporate sphere.

The president expressed hope that Kim, who just visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, “will do what is right for his people and for humanity.”","Kim’s message to Trump in Beijing: “The issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved, if South Korea and the United States respond to our efforts with goodwill, create an atmosphere of peace and stability while taking progressive and synchronous measures for the realization of peace.”","Read more toggle","Show less","Keep reading","In a later tweet, Trump confirmed that he heard directly from Xi about the Kim meeting and that “maximum sanctions and pressure” would continue against North Korea until the summit takes place:","Lyft pushes its “ethical values” vs Uber","Lyft co-founder John Zimmer. Photo: John Sciulli/Getty Images for Lyft","Lyft provided free rides to students attending March for Our Lives rallies last weekend and, according to co-founder John Zimmer, is trying to figure out how to address issues of racial equality after Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old unarmed black man, was fatally shot by police last week. “We want to figure out how to use what we do to help effect change,” Zimmer told a group of reporters in Washington yesterday.","Why it matters: Lyft sees this as a moment to highlight “having obvious ethical values” as a ride-hailing company vs Uber. In yesterday’s gathering with reporters, Zimmer was joined by former Obama White House official Valerie Jarrett, now a Lyft board member, and the two repeatedly highlighted the company’s commitment to equal pay, safe work environments, and continued activism to “protect our community.”","Read more toggle","Show less","Keep reading159 Words","Lyft will continue to take sides on certain issues, like gun violence, and gender and racial equity, Zimmer said: “If we disagree with the policy we’re going to be transparent about it and we’re going to explain why.”","Jarret discussed her decision to join the company in the context of its culture against sexual harassment. “You learn more when the bosses aren’t in the room than when they are in the room, and I think that reflects the overall culture,” she said.","But, but, but… Zimmer was also certain to note of Lyft: “We are not an activist organization.”","Bottom line: Lyft is probably more like Uber than they care to admit. They share a business model and a fixation on autonomous cars and reshaping transportation markets. Zimmer said the recent Uber accident would be a tragedy if it delayed autonomous vehicles by even one day; “that could be 100 people’s lives that are at risk,” he said.","Olympic athletes tap power of social media when games end","For many Olympic athletes, especially female athletes, a key challenge is the fact that their sport only gets seen once every four years. Social media, though, has helped many to increase their visibility of their sports as well as their individual impact.","Why it matters: Sport can be a platform to encourage girls to pursue their dreams and a keystone for equality well beyond the field of play, but that requires having a steady and lasting voice.","Read more toggle","Show less","Keep reading258 Words","“Especially coming from a small sport social media has played a really large role not just with fan engagement but helping to share my story and reach larger audiences,” fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad told Axios.","Muhammad, the first American to compete in a hijab, is currently finishing the adult and young adult version of her memoir, has her own clothing line and uses her social media presence to speak up on diversity and other issues.","As for the negative attention she gets, Muhammad said she has gotten really good at quickly deleting and blocking abusive comments. “As we are talking I am blocking somebody right now,” she said. “I do whatever I can to block and delete people who have negative energy.”","Twin ice hockey stars Monique Lamoureux-Morando and Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson are trying to use their recent gold medal win as an opportunity to see a single women’s professional league for North America, ideally with the backing of the NHL.

Photo: Olivier Douliery / Getty Images","The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear arguments from Maryland Republicans that the state’s 6th Congressional District was intentionally drawn by the Democratic-controlled state legislature to cost a GOP incumbent his seat. This comes after it heard a similar case from Democrats in Wisconsin who say the GOP-controlled legislature gerrymandered the entire state map to maximize their majority.","Why it matters: The court’s decisions, expected by June, could impose constitutional limits on partisan gerrymandering or allow it to happen with virtually no limits.","Read more toggle","Show less","Keep reading275 Words","The back story:","In many states, legislators have the power to draw new legislative and congressional districts every 10 years following the census count. Therefore, it’s no surprise the majority party would craft lines to boost their advantage — a practice known as gerrymandering.","In this case, then-Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, a Democrat, acknowledged in a deposition that “it was also my intent” to create a district “where the people would be more likely to elect a Democrat than a Republican.”","Democrats used the 2011 redistricting to flip the 6th Congressional District — a Republican stronghold — by including parts of heavily Democratic Montgomery County. It increased their advantage in the state’s congressional delegation from 6-2 to 7-1.","The lawsuit was filed in 2013, and last August a three-judge federal panel declined to throw out the voting map, which prompted Republicans to appeal to the Supreme Court.","What to watch: Most of the attention throughout the hearing will be on Justice Anthony Kennedy. When the nine justices heard the Wisconsin case last October, the court apparently split along ideological lines, leaving Kennedy seemingly with the decisive vote.","The big picture: The justices’ involvement comes at a time when partisan redistricting is drawing increasingly close scrutiny in the political debate and in the courts.","Just last week, the high court declined a GOP request to intervene in a Pennsylvania case where the state Supreme Court invalidated the state’s pro-Republican gerrymandered congressional map and replaced it with a court-drawn plan.","Poll: GOP grows more skeptical of global warming","Newly released Gallup polling shows a widening partisan split on climate change and a growing rejection among Republicans of the dominant scientific views on the topic.","Why it matters: The polling underscores why, despite rare bipartisan policy agreements, prospects for sweeping legislative action on climate change are as remote as ever. The data arrives as the White House is unwinding several Obama-era global warming initiatives.","What they found (Check out the chart above): The nationwide telephone poll of slightly over 1,000 adults in early March shows that almost nine in 10 Democrats agree that global warming is caused by humans, compared to roughly a third of Republicans.","The scientific consensus is that human activities, notably the burning of fossil fuels, have been the dominant driver of warming since the mid-20th century.","Yes, but: Overall public belief in human-caused climate change; concern about the topic; and agreement that its effects are already apparent has generally risen in recent years, even though it dipped from 2017 to 2018.","What they’re saying: “The higher level of concern Americans have exhibited about global warming since 2016, particularly in terms of worrying about the issue and believing it is caused by human activity, is largely intact this year,” Gallup analysts said in a summary of the data.","“One reason for this stability is that Americans’ views on the issue are becoming increasingly partisan and therefore entrenched. With Trump reversing many of his predecessors’ policies aimed at curbing global warming, Democrats are feeling a greater sense of urgency about the issue, while Republicans have either remained as skeptical as they had been in the past or have become more so,” Gallup added.","Lawsuit filed over FDA’s delay of e-cigarette review","Juul e-cigarettes have grown in popularity amongst teens since they are discreet, easy to use, powerful and have good flavor pods. Photo: Brianna Soukup/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images","A group of public health organizations and doctors filed a lawsuit against the Food and Drug Administration Tuesday for delaying its review of e-cigarettes — a growing concern amongst parents and pediatricians due to increased reports of adolescents and teenagers picking up “vaping” or “juuling” (when using a popular brand, Juul).","Why it matters:","“Juul is an e-cigarette that looks like a USB flash drive, charges on your computer, and is sold in sweet flavors…Each pod contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. There are widespread reports it’s being used in high schools and junior high schools…It’s exactly the kind of product the FDA needs to be reviewing now and taking action to protect our kids.”","Industry response: A Juul Labs spokesperson tells Axios: “JUUL Labs’ mission is to eliminate cigarette smoking by offering existing adult smokers a true alternative to cigarettes. JUUL is not intended for anyone else. We strongly condemn the use of our product by minors, and it is in fact illegal to sell our product to minors. No minor should be in possession of a JUUL product.”","“This lawsuit is nothing more than another shameless attempt by supposed public health groups to demagogue e-cigarettes, fully knowing that FDA already has recognized e-cigarettes are a lower-risk alternative to combustible cigarettes. We have worked diligently with this administration on its approach to regulation of the e-cigarette industry and will continue to do so. We encourage these groups do to the same.”","— Tony Abboud, executive director of Vapor Technology Association","Background: E-cigarettes are touted by some as a safe way for adults to quit smoking cigarettes. Wired writes a British study showed in 2017 that the practice has shown some success in helping adults quit. When vaping, the e-liquids are heated and inhaled with a reusable tool — and since it doesn’t contain the tar in cigarettes, it’s considered to be less carcinogenic.","Yes, but: A NAS study in January 2018 said that although they have less carcinogens, “E-cigarette smokers might have a higher risk than nonsmokers of developing lung and bladder cancers and heart diseases.”","And, as pointed out by the New York Times, a growing concern is that the nicotine in e-cigarettes is creating young addicts who could eventually turn to smoking the more harmful cigarettes. A member of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Tobacco Consortium tells Axios this may be the case:","“E-cigarettes are now the most commonly used tobacco product among youth in the United States. They have dramatically expanded the total number of adolescents who use any tobacco product.”","The trigger: In August 2017, the FDA delayed until 2021/2022 a key provision of a rule requiring manufacturers to provide critical product info to the FDA and undergo an FDA review of impact on public health, including whether it appeals to kids. Meanwhile, the products remain on the market.","The lawsuit alleges this delay “exceeds the agency’s authority” and “violates the Administrative Procedure Act because the FDA did not give the public an opportunity to comment on the change and did not articulate an adequate factual basis for this radical change from the deadlines the FDA itself established in the deeming rule.”","The members of the lawsuit include AAP, AAP’s Maryland Chapter, CTFK, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Heart Association, American Lung Association, Truth Initiative and four pediatricians.","Separately, recent science studies show nicotine is not the only ingredient to worry about in e-cigarettes.","1. The University of Rochester Medical Centre led a study in Frontiers in Physiology Jan. 30 that says e-cigarettes harm white blood cells, and that certain flavoring compounds — cinnamon, vanilla and butter — are particularly harmful. They also point out mixing flavors has a much worse effect than exposure to just one.","2. The University of North Carolina published a study Tuesday in PLOS Biology that says it confirms those three flavors in e-cigarettes are more toxic to humans than others.","Some of the harmful effects include immunosuppression, altered mucus secretion and protein changes in the cells from the lining of the lungs, according to study author Flori Sassano.","“We need regulatory measures to prevent chemicals like these to be used to make e-liquids or at least limit their concentration to safe levels to avoid toxic effects,” Sassono tells Axios.","U.S. claims tentative deal on Korea trade deal talks","Senior administration officials said on Tuesday that the Trump administration has reached “an agreement of principle” with South Korea regarding the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS).","Why it matters, per the New York Times: “Mr. Trump used his threat of stiff steel and aluminum tariffs as a cudgel to extract the concessions he wanted, helping produce an agreement that had stalled amid disagreements this year.”","Read more toggle","Show less","Keep reading304 Words","More from the Times: “The deal, which could be formally announced on Wednesday, opens the South’s market to American autos by lifting existing limits on manufacturers like Ford Motor and General Motors, extends tariffs for South Korean truck exports and restricts, by nearly a third, the amount of steel that the South can export to the United States.","“An agreement of principle”essentially means that both sides have agreed to the broad principle of a deal, but haven’t worked the technical details out yet. An administration official said when finalized, it will “be the first successful renegotiation of any trade agreement in U.S. history.”","What the agreement includes, as of now:","South Korea will be subject to a “hard annual quota” on steel products, as an alternative to the steel tariffs. The official said this will be “a product-specific quota, equivalent to 70% of the average annual export volume for steel products.” The official added that this will result in around a 30% reduction in steel shipments from Korea to the U.S.","A currency agreement, which will “prohibit competitive devaluation of currency, and ensure that there are commitments on transparency and accountability.”","Improving implementation issues, such as how South Korea “conducts its inspections at the border,” and including U.S. companies in their reimbursement policy for innovative drugs.","The 25% U.S. tariffs on pick-up trucks will be extended to 2041. The official called this a “big win for our U.S. truck producers and workers.”","“Eliminating burdensome regulations,” like different environmental standards. The official said Korea will align “their environmental standards with the U.S.,” for both vehicles and auto parts.","Doubling the cap on auto exports, which originally allowed for 25,000 vehicle exports per year, per manufacturer, the administration official said, for vehicles “built to U.S. safety standards.”","Report: Facebook is delaying its home speaker","Photo: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images","Facebook won’t unveil a home speaker with a digital assistant at a developer conference in May, Bloomberg reports, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The devices, similar to Google Home and Amazon Echo, may still be available later this year.","Why it matters: Delaying the device unveiling is “partly because the public is currently so outraged about the social network’s data-privacy practices,” Bloomberg says, and reports Facebook “had already found in focus-group testing that users were concerned about a Facebook-branded device in their living rooms, given how much intimate data the social network collects.”","Share this:","Like this:","LikeLoading...","Related","Author: nobullwithragingrobert","Was a drama critic at Manhattan College.

The company is also tangling with the media outlets reporting on it.","Saturday ended with the Attorney General of Massachusetts opening an investigation into the matter, Sen. Mark Warner saying the incident spoke to the need for new regulations and Sen. Amy Klobuchar calling for an investigation. \"Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary,\" Klobuchar tweeted.","The gritty details: At the heart of the spat between Facebook and news organizations, regulators and activists is whether or not Facebook took proper action in response to the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm used by the Trump campaign, had obtained data from 50 million users through a third-party developer that was linked to Facebook's data.","Facebook said the data was obtained legally but that its use violated its policies, which is why the company suspended the group from its platform once it learned from a New York Times report that the data was never deleted as Cambridge Analytica had promised.","Others argued the data violation should be considered a breach that Facebook was legally required to tell users about.","The dispute played out on Twitter Saturday, with an Observer editor tweeting that Facebook threatened to sue the company ahead of publication. One of the reporters on the story tweeted that “Facebook instructed external lawyers and warned us we were making 'false and defamatory' allegations.”","Facebook says it sent the news organization a letter making the case that using the term \"breach\" was incorrect.","Facebook executives argued on Twitter that \"breach\" was an inaccurate descriptor, but its top security executive ultimately had to delete his tweets. Alex Stamos, the executive, said he'd deleted them because \"I can't stop people from using the most uncharitable interpretation of what I wrote to put words in my mouth.\"","What's next: This weekend's stories have raised a raft of new questions about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook's handling of issues that could be linked to the ongoing investigation into Russian election interference.","David Carroll, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design in New York, has been leading the charge to understand how Cambridge's UK parent company, SCL Group Ltd, profiled millions of Americans.","He asks: \"What does the mean for all of CA’s commercial clients? Will any brands hire CA after this? What about partners like comScore? Not a good look, moving forward. How is the whole ad industry reacting to the whistleblower?\"","The bigger picture: The issues raised by these stories are at the core of how Facebook makes money. So, however you describe it, the reports have put more force behind questions about whether Facebook is capable of policing its own platform and the data that powers it. Even other Silicon Valley companies are coming to that conclusion.","\"Welp,\" tweeted Aaron Levie, the CEO of cloud storage company Box. \"Tech is definitely about to get regulated.

{"originalurl":"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10carr.html","title":"How Obama Tapped Into Social Networks’ Power - The New York Times","text":["Site Mobile Navigation","How Obama Tapped Into Social Networks’ Power","In February 2007, a friend called Marc Andreessen, a founder of Netscape and a board member of Facebook, and asked if he wanted to meet with a man with an idea that sounded preposterous on its face.","Always game for something new, Mr. Andreessen headed to the San Francisco airport late one night to hear the guy out. A junior member of a large and powerful organization with a thin, but impressive, résumé, he was about to take on far more powerful forces in a battle for leadership.","He wondered if social networking, with its tremendous communication capabilities and aggressive database development, might help him beat the overwhelming odds facing him.","“It was like a guy in a garage who was thinking of taking on the biggest names in the business,” Mr. Andreessen recalled. “What he was doing shouldn’t have been possible, but we see a lot of that out here and then something clicks. He was clearly supersmart and very entrepreneurial, a person who saw the world and the status quo as malleable.”","Like a lot of Web innovators, the Obama campaign did not invent anything completely new. Instead, by bolting together social networking applications under the banner of a movement, they created an unforeseen force to raise money, organize locally, fight smear campaigns and get out the vote that helped them topple the Clinton machine and then John McCain and the Republicans.","As a result, when he arrives at 1600 Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama will have not just a political base, but a database, millions of names of supporters who can be engaged almost instantly. And there’s every reason to believe that he will use the network not just to campaign, but to govern. His e-mail message to supporters on Tuesday night included the line, “We have a lot of work to do to get our country back on track, and I’ll be in touch soon about what comes next.” The incoming administration is already open for business on the Web at Change.gov, a digital gateway for the transition.","The Bush campaign arrived at the White House with a conviction that it would continue a conservative revolution with the help of Karl Rove’s voter lists, phone banks and direct mail. But those tools were crude and expensive compared with what the Obama camp is bringing to the Oval Office.","“I think it is very significant that he was the first post-boomer candidate for president,” Mr. Andreessen said. “Other politicians I have met with are always impressed by the Web and surprised by what it could do, but their interest sort of ended in how much money you could raise. He was the first politician I dealt with who understood that the technology was a given and that it could be used in new ways.”","The juxtaposition of a networked, open-source campaign and a historically imperial office will have profound implications and raise significant questions. Special-interest groups and lobbyists will now contend with an environment of transparency and a president who owes them nothing. The news media will now contend with an administration that can take its case directly to its base without even booking time on the networks.","More profoundly, while many people think that President-elect Obama is a gift to the Democratic Party, he could actually hasten its demise. Political parties supply brand, ground troops, money and relationships, all things that Mr. Obama already owns.","And his relationships are not the just traditional ties of Democrats — teachers’ unions, party faithful and Hollywood moneybags — but a network of supporters who used a distributed model of phone banking to organize and get out the vote, helped raise a record-breaking $600 million, and created all manner of media clips that were viewed millions of times. It was an online movement that begot offline behavior, including producing youth voter turnout that may have supplied the margin of victory.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","“Thomas Jefferson used newspapers to win the presidency, F.D.R. used radio to change the way he governed, J.F.K. was the first president to understand television, and Howard Dean saw the value of the Web for raising money,” said Ranjit Mathoda, a lawyer and money manager who blogs at Mathoda.com. “But Senator Barack Obama understood that you could use the Web to lower the cost of building a political brand, create a sense of connection and engagement, and dispense with the command and control method of governing to allow people to self-organize to do the work.”","All of the Obama supporters who traded their personal information for a ticket to a rally or an e-mail alert about the vice presidential choice, or opted in on Facebook or MyBarackObama can now be mass e-mailed at a cost of close to zero. And instead of the constant polling that has been a motor of presidential governance, an Obama White House can use the Web to measure voter attitudes.","“When you think about it, a campaign is a start-up business,” Mr. Mathoda said. “Other than his speech in 2004 at the convention and his two books, Mr. Obama had very little in terms of brand to begin with, and he was up against Senator Clinton, who had all the traditional sources of power, and then Senator McCain. But he had the right people and the right idea to take them on. When you think about it, it was like he was going up against Google and Yahoo. And he won.”","There is tremendous power in opening citizen access to government — think of how much good will and support Mayor Michael Bloomberg garnered by coming up with 311, a one-stop phone number for New Yorkers who had a problem.","But now Senator Obama’s 20-month conversation with the electorate enters a new phase. There is sense of ownership, a kind of possessive entitlement, on the part of the people who worked to elect him. The shorthand for his organizing Web site, “MyBO,” says it all.","“People will continue to expect a conversation, a two-way relationship that is a give and take,” said Thomas Gensemer, managing partner of Blue State Digital, which helped conceive and put into effect Obama’s digital outreach. “People who were part of the campaign will opt in to political or governing tracks and those relationships will continue in some form.”","The founders of America wanted a government that reflected its citizens, but would be at remove from the baser impulses of the mob. The mob, flush with victory, is at hand, but instead of pitchforks and lanterns, they have broadband and YouTube. Like every other presidency, the Obama administration will have its battles with the media, but that may seem like patty-cake if it runs afoul of the self-publishing, self-organizing democracy it helped create — say, by delaying health care legislation or breaking a promise on taxes.","That’s the thing about pipes today: they run both ways.","“It’s clear there has been a dramatic shift,” said Andrew Rasiej, the founder of the Personal Democracy Forum, an annual conference about the intersection of politics and technology. “Any politician who fails to recognize that we are in a post-party era with a new political ecology in which connecting like minds and forming a movement is so much easier will not be around long.","“Yes, we have met Big Brother, the one who is always watching. And Big Brother is us.”"],"isopubdate":"2008-11-09"}

In November 2015, I poked my friend Britta for the third time in a row. At 13.46 EST on 2 December 2017, I deactivated Facebook for the 28th time. My peer group has reached Established Adult Life. I have unfriended 19 people: two of these were exes and one was my former dentist. Take it from me, do not accept friend requests from your dentist.","Those are just a few of the details contained in the archive of my Facebook history, which I downloaded on Monday. I stopped actively using the site years ago, but recently decided to delete my Facebook for good. First, however, I wanted to save a copy of my data. After all, I have been on the site for more than 11 years, almost a third of my life. My Facebook is basically a mausoleum of my 20s; a repository of old photos, status updates and conversations with people who have drifted out of my life.","Downloading your Facebook history is easy. Just go to settings and select the option to get your data. It took Facebook a few minutes to prepare my information, and then my entire history was neatly archived in four folders. Looking through your downloaded data reveals certain information you ordinarily wouldn’t see. For example, Facebook assigns one of two labels to what it calls your Friend Peer Group: Starting Adult Life or Established Adult Life. It is possible there are other classifications, such as Inept at Adult Life, but I couldn’t find them in my research.","You also get a file called facedata.htm, which contains your facial recognition intel. Facebook doesn’t appear to classify your face into categories like Adult Face That’s Starting to Look Old but I wouldn’t put it past them.","Then there’s a list of topics Facebook thinks you’re interested in and shares with advertisers. Mine included the aforementioned homosexuality and dinner, as well as things such as advertising agencies and journalism. Alongside this is information on advertisers who have your contact information and ads you’ve clicked on. Last Thursday, I apparently clicked on an ad for The Economist which mentioned a free notebook. Even in Established Adult Life, it is hard to resist a free notebook.","If you haven’t downloaded your Facebook history I highly recommend doing so. While we are all aware our online interactions leave a digital footprint, it is easy to forget how expansive that footprint is. Seeing your digital life organised into folders is something of a wakeup call, particularly when you realise the data Facebook lets you download is just the tip of the iceberg of what it knows about you. It doesn’t show you the full extent of the third-party data it has access to, for example, and it doesn’t let you know all the ways it has analysed your data.","After looking through my Facebook history, I felt inspired to archive my entire digital footprint. From my Uber rides to my Spotify listening history to my Google search results to my Netflix statistics – I wanted to examine the full extent of my data trail. As you can imagine, this exercise quickly became overwhelming. My data, I soon realised, was everywhere, and most of it was difficult, if not impossible, to access. It shouldn’t be like that, I thought indignantly. Companies should make it easier for us to keep track of our digital footprint. But they don’t and, I’m afraid to say, it wasn’t long before I abandoned my valiant attempts to take back control of my data.","Perhaps rather predictably, I started to think about homosexuality and dinner instead.","Don’t call it a punback","Last week, I spent a sweaty evening in Brooklyn surrounded by cunning linguists. I was at Punderdome, which is a monthly pun competition. Contestants get 90 seconds to come up with wordplay on a given topic and the audience votes on who should progress to the next round and become the punofficial champion of the night. While the audience and the contestants were largely made up of “woke” and very PC millennials, the wordplay was often smutty and occasionally homophonic. Despite this, it was very good fun.","It was also extremely packed fun. Who knew, but puns are trendy now. Judging by the amount of manicured facial hair I inadvertently brushed up against, every hipster in New York had turned up to enjoy a night of competitive punning. Some of the contestants even had groupies.","You know what? Seeing so many people pay good money to enjoy bad jokes was actually a rather heartening experience. You see, for centuries the poor pun has been much maligned. Dryden, for example, called puns, or “clenches”, the “lowest and most groveling kind of wit”. To be honest, if Dryden had used more puns his work wouldn’t have been so dry then, would it? (Sorry). Look, there I go, apologising for a harmless pun. This is exactly the problem I’m talking about. People feel obliged to groan when they hear a pun and say sorry when they make one. For years, pun-lovers have been forced to apologise for who they are and what they love.","But perhaps that’s all changing. Punderdome is just one example of what seems to be a burgeoning pun scene. There’s the UK Pun Championships, for example, and the O.Henry Pun-Off World Championships in Texas. Mark my words, the humble pun is on the rise.","Rate a species with zoo reviews","In otter news, it seems everyone is obsessed with rating everything these days – from your Uber driver to your brunch to your favourite carnivorous mammal. Last Friday, Oregon Zoo tweeted an Amazon-style review of a river otter: “Overall very good first impressions.

{"originalurl":"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/magazine/the-obama-campaigns-digital-masterminds-cash-in.html?referer=","title":"The Obama Campaign’s Digital Masterminds Cash In - The New York Times","text":["The Obama Campaign’s Digital Masterminds Cash In","Earlier this year, senior members of President Barack Obama’s campaign team took a trip to Las Vegas. Nevada holds a special place in Obama-wonk lore as the place where his monthslong strategy of defeating Hillary Clinton by slowly and surely amassing delegates emerged. But the operatives were not there in March for any political reason. They were there to make money — specifically to land what they hoped would be the first corporate client for their new advertising business, Analytics Media Group (A.M.G.). Its bland name obscures its relatively grand promise: to deliver to commercial advertisers some of the Obama campaign’s secret, technologically advanced formulas for reaching voters.","The potential client was Caesars. The casino chain was looking for ways to induce semiregular visitors to show up more routinely at its other casinos around the country and to keep regulars from defecting to new competitors. A.M.G. was making the pitch that keeping gamblers loyal to Caesars was not all that different from keeping onetime Obama voters from straying to Mitt Romney. It was all a matter of figuring out how to get their message in front of the right customers at the right time. It was not lost on the Obama strategists that the “change” they were talking about was not the kind “you can believe in” but rather the kind you can put in a slot machine. “I kind of felt like the Devil’s advocate,” Chauncey McLean, 31, the Democratic Party’s director of media tracking during the campaign and now A.M.G.’s chief operating officer, wryly told me.","A.M.G. was founded in late December by a splinter group of longtime Obama advisers: Larry Grisolano, who oversaw how the campaign spent its advertising dollars; Grisolano’s direct-mail partners Terry Walsh and Pete Giangreco; Jeff Link, a seasoned Iowa veteran who was an outside adviser in 2012; and Erik Smith, an advertising consultant for the 2012 campaign, whose work running one of the biggest 2004 pro-Kerry outside groups gave him an inside track with party donors from the corporate world.","McLean was their first hire. During the campaign he proved himself to be particularly deft at translating between the old hands of the political world, who talk about “message” and “narrative,” and the quants in their 20s, who speak of “code” and “algorithms.”","McLean was so moved by Obama’s 2004 convention speech — the one that called for an end to a red-state America and a blue-state America — that when Obama decided to run in 2008, he took a leave from law school and joined the campaign. He had just spent the last 18 months of the 2012 presidential race bouncing between a couch in Washington and a small, shared apartment in Chicago where a colleague slept in the dining room. So he was experiencing considerable culture shock in the high life of Vegas.","Arriving at Caesars Palace after a first-class flight (only the second of his life), he was shown to his room. “I open the door and there’s just this huge, like, double, wall-to-wall window with a view of the strip and a huge king bed,” he said. Over room service, he met with his deputy, Chris Frommann, now 26, and made some last-minute revisions to their proposal. McLean took an iPhone picture of his kung pao chicken and sent it to his wife back in Brooklyn, “to show her that I’d made it,” he joked.","The next morning McLean, Frommann, Grisolano, Smith and a couple of others were escorted through a maze of doors that led them to the casino’s marble-and-glass executive offices, where their meeting went well enough that they scheduled another, to discuss a deal. Later that night they celebrated with a red-meat-and-red-wine dinner at Old Homestead, Caesars’ upscale steakhouse.","Recalling that Vegas trip while sitting at a MacBook Pro-dotted coffee shop in Brooklyn in March, McLean treated his shift from selling Obama to selling Caesars as a small discomfort that was necessary if he wanted to keep working on the technological advancements he and his colleagues developed on the campaign. In a nonpresidential year, no political effort would have the money to finance what he described as the “huge R.& D. project” that the Obama campaign effectively became. The resources for that kind of project could now be found only in corporate America. If companies with big budgets wanted members of Obama’s team to do for them whatever it was that they did for the president, McLean couldn’t see why they shouldn’t answer the call.","Political marketing has usually lagged behind commercial marketing. Companies that spend billions of dollars a year developing ways to make many more billions of dollars a year tend to have little to learn from presidential campaigns, which are generally start-ups aimed at a one-day sale. But the (re)selling of the president, 2012, was an entirely different matter. The campaign recruited the best young minds in the booming fields of analytics and behavioral science and placed them in a room they called “the cave” for up to 16 hours a day over the course of roughly 16 months. After the election, when the technology wizards finally came out, they had not only helped produce a victory that defied a couple of historical predictors; they also developed a host of highly effective marketing techniques that were either entirely new or had never been tried on such a grand scale.","Grisolano and McLean and the others were part of a singular breakthrough in the field of television-ad buying, where about 50 percent of the campaign’s budget was spent, or more than $400 million. Previous campaigns would make decisions about how to direct their television-advertising budgets largely based on hunches and deductions about what channels the voters they wanted to reach were watching. Their choices were informed by the broad viewership ratings of Nielsen and other survey data, which typically led to buying relatively expensive ads during evening-news and prime-time viewing hours. The 2012 campaign took advantage of advanced set-top-box monitoring technology to figure out what shows the voters they wanted to reach were watching and when, resulting in a smarter and cheaper — if potentially more invasive — way to beam commercials into their homes. The system gave Obama a significant advantage over Mitt Romney, according to Democrats and many Republicans (at least those who were not on Romney’s media team). Now A.M.G.’s founders say the company is at the forefront of a move to turn upside down the way the $60-billion-a-year television-ad market has functioned since its start. And they hope to get very rich in the process.","That is essentially the pitch Grisolano began making just before Christmas to the tech whizzes he needed to hire to rebuild the system they used during the campaign. He also offered profit sharing and salaries often commensurate with those being offered by Facebook or Google, who were also recruiting from the Obama campaign.","“You’re sort of involved in this cutting edge of something and see this whole thing on the horizon changing,” Grisolano recounted telling them. “I think that’s exciting.”","McLean, for one, was primed to hear his message. When the election was won last fall, he asked Jim Messina, Obama’s innovative campaign manager — and ardent tech advocate — what he should do with his life. As McLean tells it, and Messina affirms, Messina said, “I’d either go out into the country and run a campaign or I’d go make a load of money.”","A couple of weeks before Election Day, over drinks at the Pump Room in Chicago’s Gold Coast, a safe distance away from the re-election headquarters and its press minders, Grisolano and Erik Smith first let on that there was far more happening in the Chicago campaign office than any of us covering it truly understood. Grisolano told me that the campaign literally knew every single wavering voter in the country that it needed to persuade to vote for Obama, by name, address, race, sex and income. What’s more, he hinted, the campaign had figured out how to get its television advertisements in front of them with a previously inconceivable level of knowledge and accuracy.","Grisolano, a gruff and stocky Iowan, spent years in the shadow of his mentor, Obama’s founding strategist, David Axelrod, happily so, but he now seemed eager for his own recognition. There was also no mistaking that he believed he had figured something out that would be worth a lot of money after the election. He wouldn’t say more, at least not then. But after the election, in February, he began to describe his new business venture to me in detail.","To understand how it works, you must first understand the vast technological engine that powered the campaign but remained largely out of view of the public and the press. Messina, the campaign manager, often boasted about how the Obama 2012 effort would be “the most data-driven campaign ever.” But what that truly meant — the extent to which the campaign used the newest tech tools to look into people’s lives and the sheer amount of personal data its vast servers were crunching — remained largely shrouded. The secrecy around the operation was partly because the president’s strategists wanted to maintain their competitive edge. But it was also no doubt because they worried that practices like “data mining” and “analytics” could make voters uncomfortable.","Using data wasn’t new for the Obama strategists. The 2008 campaign developed the most sophisticated system to date to identify tens of millions of voters and place them into useful categories: those most likely to vote Republican, who would be ignored; those supporting Obama — and how likely they were to vote. That system — based on a complicated scoring method that relied on the processing of reams of data — was first devised by an outside consultant, Ken Strasma. But it was partly managed inside the campaign by an economics forecaster, Dan Wagner, who, at 24, helped perfect it for the campaign’s use. Wagner, who was recruited by A.M.G. but decided to start his own venture instead, seems to exist in two realms. One is digital, where he operates like a Dungeons and Dragons dungeon master, trying to shape the rules to the reality he is creating (“I was a Level 14 wizard or something,” he jokes of the fantasy role-playing game). The other is corporeal, where he is self-deprecating about things like his romantic life. (“Hey, I do ‘Big Data,’ ” he says.) His work on the 2008 campaign has been portrayed in a book, “The Victory Lab,” by Sasha Issenberg. “Here’s where I am in the ‘Victory Lab’ — blah, blah, blah,” he said dryly while turning to his chapter in the copy I was carrying when we met for breakfast at the Ace Hotel in Manhattan one day in May.","Wagner dismisses the notion of “romantic war rooms” operating on political gut instinct as outdated and misguided. His is a hard-data system that rejects anything that is not definitively quantifiable. In the Bush era, strategists boasted about how they could predict voter behavior based upon car and sport preferences, a well-publicized bit of political magic that captured the imaginations of politicians and journalists alike. Wagner’s approach, part of a broader move in politics, cut all of that out; why engage in such divination when you have the time and money to just call voters and ask them about their leanings directly? “We’re trying to predict political preference; we’re not trying to predict whether you buy a car,” Wagner says dismissively.","Photo","Left to right: Gaurav Shirole, Chris Frommann, Chauncey McLean, Will St. Clair.Credit\nAndrew Hetherington for The New York Times","The campaign couldn’t call the more than 150 million registered voters, obviously. But they could call enough of them in swing states (up to 11,000 a night) to figure out how they — and other people who lived near them, looked like them and earned like them — were likely to vote with an increasing degree of accuracy. In 2008, Wagner and his small team combined information from those calls with any other data they could find — census data, state voter lists and the like — and fed it into algorithms that produced support scores. One ranked how likely swing-state voters were to support Obama on a scale of 0 to 100, and another ranked how likely they were to show up at voting booths. Those scores helped the campaign direct resources toward the right voters, and Obama beat John McCain by 7 percentage points.","But even before the president took office, as the economy was in meltdown, his strategists, looking ahead four years, assumed that his re-election would not be easy. Wagner was assigned to the Democratic National Committee headquarters, where he set out to develop a far more sophisticated version of his analytics system, using bigger computer servers, better data on the nation’s voting-age population and more precise algorithms.","If there was any doubt about the system, it was dispelled after the 2010 special election in Massachusetts for the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by Edward M. Kennedy’s death. For much of the campaign, pollsters for the Democratic candidate, Martha Coakley, showed her ahead. Wagner and his group had their own numbers indicating that Coakley’s support was soft and dropping. His warnings went up the chain to the president, but some strategists dismissed him as if he were a “ ‘dumb kid,’ ” Wagner told me.","After Coakley lost and Wagner’s methods were validated, the Democratic Party poured money into Wagner’s department, which grew from 2 people to 15. Later that year, Wagner’s team developed the prototype for what Messina says he considers “an evolutionary jump”: a newly robust and reliable “persuasion score” that identified how easily individual undecided voters could be persuaded to vote for or against the Democrat in a race, based on how likely they were to show shifts in their preferences in telephone interviews conducted over time.","When Messina started up the Obama re-election campaign in 2011, he gave Wagner the go-ahead to nearly quadruple his team, which was moved to the cavernous office space at the Prudential Center in Chicago. This immediately made his analytics department one of the biggest of its kind in the country.","Obama supported the idea, aides said. But he warned in one early meeting against getting too deep into the data and “slicing the salami too thin,” as his communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, put it to me.","Soon after the office opened, Wagner’s group moved into a separate, windowless room, the cave. Messina said he wanted them to lose all sense of time and to focus. Wagner also cited the secret nature of the work. I once unknowingly wandered near the cave, looking for a bathroom, and a young press aide chased me down and escorted me away. (Because it was also near the kitchen, at the time I thought the aide was concerned I might try to force a metaphor out of an exposed piece of rotting fruit.)","“Anybody who had a computer and a basement as a kid saw the cave as a real opportunity,” Wagner told me. It was packed with about 40 desks, a number that was determined through a contest Wagner held among his staff to figure out how to “best utilize the floor plan.” The result came from “the best combination of square footage per person, subject to constraints: You couldn’t move your arms more than six inches without hitting somebody,” he said. On the back of the door his team would affix pieces of paper with snippets of conversation they heard from people who walked by: “Those people are weird, don’t go in there” or “That’s the secret sauce.” Across one wall there was a large printout of the surface of Mars, a mocking reference to a column in The Wall Street Journal in which Peggy Noonan described a job posting of Wagner’s as “politics as done by Martians.”","In fact, through his postings, Wagner assembled a team that included a biophysicist, who worked at the Stem Cell Initiative at Harvard and three professional poker players. The cave dwellers would take breaks at the Ping-Pong table out in the main offices with their peers; Gaurav Shirole, a 23-year-old data analyst and graduate of the business school at the University of California, Berkeley, who also joined A.M.G., became so good that when the president visited the campaign office during the summer, the staff volunteered Shirole to compete against Obama. (Shirole won, but got in trouble with his mother when she saw the photo of him playing in flip-flops and a T-shirt.)","Yet in truth, their task was daunting. Shortly after Messina opened the Chicago offices, Joel Benenson, the president’s national pollster, conducted a “benchmark” poll that had some sobering results. Roughly a fifth of Obama’s 2008 vote had shifted into the undecided column. “We knew we weren’t going to get all of them,” Benenson said. But the campaign needed to get back many millions of them. And it fell to Wagner’s team to figure out exactly who they were, to a man and to a woman, and then rank them according to a 0 to 10 persuasion score.","As the denizens of the cave were setting out to do that, the digital-analytics team, led by Rayid Ghani, a 35-year-old research scientist from Accenture Labs, developed an idea: Why not try sifting through self-described supporters’ Facebook pages in search of friends who might be on the campaign’s list of the most persuadable voters? Then the campaign could ask the self-identified supporters to bring their undecided friends along. The technique, as they saw it, could also get supporters to urge friends to register to vote, to vote early or to volunteer and donate.","Identifying persuadable friends became a significant undertaking. “We ended up building it from scratch because nothing like that existed,” Ghani told me. The computer code alone was thousands of lines, said Will St. Clair, 25, who helped write it and who also now works with McLean at A.M.G.","The campaign didn’t go into much detail, at the time, about exactly how it used Facebook. But St. Clair put it in fairly stark terms when I talked to him at A.M.G.’s temporary offices in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in April. They started with a list that grew to a million people who had signed into the campaign Web site through Facebook. When people opted to do so, they were met with a prompt asking to grant the campaign permission to scan their Facebook friends lists, their photos and other personal information. In another prompt, the campaign asked for access to the users’ Facebook news feeds, which 25 percent declined, St. Clair said.","Once permission was granted, the campaign had access to millions of names and faces they could match against their lists of persuadable voters, potential donors, unregistered voters and so on. “It would take us 5 to 10 seconds to get a friends list and match it against the voter list,” St. Clair said. They found matches about 50 percent of the time, he said. But the campaign’s ultimate goal was to deputize the closest Obama-supporting friends of voters who were wavering in their affections for the president. “We would grab the top 50 you were most active with and then crawl their wall” to figure out who were most likely to be their real-life friends, not just casual Facebook acquaintances. St. Clair, a former high-school marching-band member who now wears a leather Diesel jacket, explained: “We asked to see photos but really we were looking for who were tagged in photos with you, which was a really great way to dredge up old college friends — and ex-girlfriends,” he said.","The campaign’s exhaustive use of Facebook triggered the site’s internal safeguards. “It was more like we blew through an alarm that their engineers hadn’t planned for or knew about,” said St. Clair, who had been working at a small firm in Chicago and joined the campaign at the suggestion of a friend. “They’d sigh and say, ‘You can do this as long as you stop doing it on Nov. 7.’ ” (Facebook officials say warning bells go off when the site sees large amounts of unusual activity, but in each case the company was satisfied the campaign was not violating its privacy and data standards.)","By March 2012, Wagner’s team had a workable list of what it deemed to be the most persuadable voters — in total, roughly 15 million of them in the swing states. Messina ordered the campaign to direct a majority of its efforts toward winning them back, one by one if necessary. They could reach many through their Facebook friends and others through more conventional means like e-mail and knocking on doors. But how could the Obama campaign be as targeted and tech-savvy on TV?","The Internet, and specifically social media, may have fundamentally changed politics, but there is still nothing with the power to enrage or inspire like a well-produced television ad (see “47 percent, Romney”). This is in part because of the evocative nature of video, which can be transmitted over the Internet as well. But it’s also because that imagery is typically put in front of people when they are at their most receptive, zoning out on the couch, relaxing, their defenses down.","TV advertising has also historically been the most expensive and least efficient way to reach voters. Commercial TV time is still valued and sold in pretty much the same way as it was when people gathered every night to watch Walter Cronkite. Most advertising is based on audience ratings kept by Nielsen Media Research, which derives its information from a national survey of 22,000 households and smaller surveys in local markets, selected to perfectly represent the American television-viewing population, Nielsen says. Through “people meters” that monitor what specific members of these households are watching in real time and, in some cases, written diaries of its participating families, Nielsen does a reasonably good job of telling advertisers which demographic groups are watching which shows. Nielsen’s ratings categories are still dominated by the broad audience segment known as “adults 18 to 49,” but they can also include smaller groups like “women 18-plus” and “Hispanics.” If Revlon wants to sell its newest shade of lipstick, for example, it knows it can reach lots of women through a show like “Grey’s Anatomy.” If Miller Lite wants to get its shiny blue cans in front of young men in their beer-drinking prime, it knows it can do so through spots on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”","Political campaigns have typically shown most of their ads during news programs, where they can reach older viewers who are engaged in the topics of the day and, it stands to reason, are most likely to vote. If a pollster identified other broad groups that a candidate wanted to reach, like women or young men, then the campaign could venture out into other shows. Traditionally, “these are the tools that you have,” Grisolano told me one day at his office in Chicago, the L train screeching along the rails outside. “You have programming that overdelivers or underdelivers in broad, sweeping groups.”","The better that campaigns — and all major marketers — have become at identifying precisely whom they want to talk to, the more inefficient the old model can seem. For instance, a campaign may need to win over those 5 percent of independent, female, likely voters who are still undecided, but there is no separate ratings category for them, no precise way to know which shows they are watching. It’s very likely a campaign can speak to some of them through commercials on “Grey’s Anatomy,” but by buying time there, the campaign is spending a lot of money on an audience that is mostly made up of people the candidate actually does not need to speak to.","The 2012 Obama campaign knew it had to be especially efficient in buying television time because it expected to be outspent by the combined forces of the Romney campaign and super PACs, including the American Crossroads organization, co-founded by Karl Rove.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","“If we had to withstand being outspent — and nobody wanted to withstand it — but if we had to, we could tolerate being outspent with the people who have basically already made up their mind for us or the people who made up their mind against us,” Grisolano said. “But we were going to make sure that we put the full power of our buy with the people who were swing voters, who were on the edge. So, my task became, how do you create the tools you need to make that a reality?”","Grisolano was going to have one thing at his disposal that no presidential adviser had before him: Wagner’s list of roughly 15 million persuadable voters. But he had no way of knowing if he would be able to reach them with any real precision on TV. He turned to Amy Gershkoff, a young political scientist he met a couple of years before who was making a name for herself grappling with just these sorts of challenges. Gershkoff was 30 years old, had a Ph.D. from Princeton and had developed software that was making political ad buying more efficient. Gershkoff was digging more deeply into the Nielsen data and matching it against information in party-voter lists to get a better read on what shows key voting blocs — not generic television audiences — were watching. She was finding that a campaign could reach many of them in greater concentrations and for less money on cable channels like Lifetime than on more expensive shows with bigger audiences like “The Office.”","Grisolano recommended that Messina speak with her, and Messina hired her to be director of media planning, reporting directly to him. Messina wanted Gershkoff to build a master program that would allow him, as the campaign manager, to decide how to spend the campaign’s advertising budget across all mediums — not just television, but the Internet, radio, print ads and the mail — at optimum cost using real-time polling data to measure how the ads were moving or not moving opinion. (A version of this project would be built by McLean, whom Gershkoff brought with her, and Frommann, his deputy.)","But it soon became clear that such a system could eliminate the role of Obama’s longtime television-ad-buying firm, GMMB, run by the senior Obama strategist Jim Margolis, which stood to potentially lose millions in buying commissions. Colleagues described Margolis as furious. He called it “dumbfounded.” Grisolano and Axelrod backed him up in his argument that any savings on commissions would be wiped out in the chaos of recreating a system that already existed (and forgoing the expertise and relationships that Margolis’s 30-person buying team had in the television world).","Messina relented, but said that GMMB would take guidance from Gershkoff’s department. As Gershkoff put it to me gingerly when we spoke in May: “Fundamentally I was brought in to create tools that would help Jim spend nine digits’ worth of the campaign’s budget. Any time you’re moving that kind of money around, people can be resistant to the idea.”","There were other turf battles. Gershkoff was given her own analytics department to analyze media, but Wagner believed all analytics should be handled uniformly through his department, several former campaign officials said. (He wouldn’t discuss it with me when I asked about it.) The two had differences in other areas as well. Gershkoff insisted that her staff members wear business attire; Wagner, who often wore flip-flops, had only one requirement of his staff in the cave: “You have to wear clothes.”","But Gershkoff had come upon a cache of data that all the strategists would come to appreciate. She had contracted with a relatively new firm called Rentrak that was competing with Nielsen and was buying up real-time, raw viewing data directly from cable and satellite companies that had nearly 20 million set-top boxes in eight million homes. When Gershkoff told Grisolano, he was thrilled. Rentrak’s huge new trove of data, he surmised, could help him find out with relative certainty what shows were being delivered to the homes of the roughly 15 million persuadable voters Wagner’s department had identified.","The concept for the “optimizer,” as it was known in the campaign, was born: a system that could determine with more precision than ever what swing voters were watching in the greatest concentrations and how to get commercials in front of them in the cheapest advertising time slots possible. But making that idea a reality was going to be very difficult. “My first idea was, O.K., I’ve got a list of people who I know are targets here,” Grisolano said. “I’ve got a list of viewers and what they watch over here. Just match them up and spit out what TV shows my targets are watching.” He acknowledged that “what I didn’t necessarily fully grasp in my enthusiastic naïveté was that the size and magnitude of these data sets are apparently extraordinary, and the engineering feat of doing what I wanted to do was a lot more complicated than I envisioned it.”","That task would not ultimately be overseen by Gershkoff. By the end of 2011, she left the campaign, her tenure cut short by a family emergency, she said. When she re-emerged that spring, it was as the director of global analytics at the public relations and advertising firm Burson-Marsteller.","Responsibility for building the optimizer was handed off to Wagner. “We took over in January and then had to build it from scratch, completely from scratch,” he said. Fortunately, there happened to be a rare expert in set-top-box data, named Carol Davidsen, working in the cave. Davidsen looks younger than her 37 years — “no kids,” she says — and she speaks in a rapid, elliptical manner, as if her thoughts are running too fast for her sentences to keep pace. Before joining the campaign, she had a successful career as a forward-thinking data engineer. But she had become fed up with corporate life by the time she received an unsolicited e-mail from Wagner’s analytics department, which recruited employees by searching the 2008 online-donor list for those who listed themselves as programmers. “I’m a huge supporter of Barack Obama,” she said a few weeks ago at Think Coffee in Greenwich Village. “But I also was kind of at a time in my life where I needed to be part of a perfect team, and I knew that was possible in a world where people weren’t worried about getting a raise or people weren’t worried about getting a promotion.”","Her previous employer, Navic Networks, was a very early pioneer in the field of set-top-box data collection. And she was one of the early programmers to figure out how to make a television, designed as a one-way path for sending programming into American homes, relay information back about what exactly a viewer was watching.","Davidsen determined that Rentrak could roughly do what Grisolano wanted it to do: produce data that could be checked against Wagner’s list of most-persuadable voters to find matches. Rentrak had access to the set-top boxes in the homes of thousands of the targeted voters in every competitive market of every swing state. (For instance, Rentrak had 100,000 people in its Denver sample, some 20,000 of whom were on the Obama list; Nielsen had a total of 600 people in Denver.)","But there was the potentially politically explosive matter of privacy. Unlike Facebook, where users were at least giving the campaign explicit permission to collect personal data even if they had not read the fine print, television watchers were making no such agreement. To address this, the campaign and Rentrak hired a third party to “anonymize” the data so that they would only know that the information was coming from a set-top box of somebody on the persuadable list; identifying information would be stripped away.","The optimizer software would then comb advertising price and viewership data to figure out the top-rated time slots among those on the Obama persuadable list — which could vary from market to market — and then rank them based on which produced the highest concentration of the Obama swing voters at the best rates. The results were striking. The campaign determined that two of the top shows to buy were 1 a.m. repeats of “The Insider” and afternoon episodes of “Judge Joe Brown” — shows that were far cheaper than the evening news or anything being shown on the networks in prime time. “When you’re talking about ‘The Insider,’ that might be shift workers in a state like Ohio, folks who are working class and aren’t getting home until midnight,” said Daniel Jester, the head GMMB buyer, who was aggressively locking in low rates early. “The person watching ‘Judge Joe Brown’ in the afternoon also may be the same viewer watching ‘The Insider’ at 1 a.m.”","The Romney campaign was not pursuing these same voters the same way. If they had been, Davidsen told me, the market would have become competitive, prices would have spiked and the system would have lost some of its advantage. As far as the Obama team was concerned, the optimizer helped it do what most strategists deemed impossible in a campaign between two well-financed opponents — talk to undecided voters through television advertisements on shows on which the opposition was not running a countermessage.","By Election Day, the Obama campaign had done far more to utilize cable and to run ads at odd times of day — who watches “Area 51” on Syfy at 2:30 a.m.? — than Romney had. In all, Obama ran nearly twice as many cable ads as Romney did, 588,006, on more than twice as many channels, 100, according to analysis by NCC Media, which helped both campaigns place spots.","It is not that the Romney campaign was unaware such technology could be developed. Rentrak, a nonpartisan vendor, reached out to offer its services in the spring of 2012 but found no takers. The former Bush strategist Sara Fagen worked with the Romney consulting firm TargetPoint to develop a competing optimizing service, but, she said, the media team “chose not to use it.” (She is now working with some TargetPoint colleagues to develop one for a new company they are forming, Deep Root Analytics.)","Stuart Stevens, Romney’s chief strategist, said the campaign used plenty of data to inform its television buying. But as far as he was concerned, Fagen was one of many offering some new service. The Romney campaign, he said, had a different mission than Obama’s. “We still were trying to inform likely voters who Mitt Romney was,” he said, “and until you get those voters, you’re insane to go off and say, ‘We’re going to try to win this with left-handed Lithuanians.’ ”","In the end, an analysis by the Republican ad-buying firm National Media found that Obama paid roughly 35 percent less per broadcast commercial than Romney did. Kantar Media CMAG, an ad-monitoring firm, showed that Obama and his supporting super PAC got nearly 40,000 more spots on the air than Romney and his super PACs did despite spending roughly $90 million less.","The day after Obama won 51 percent of the vote, he visited his Chicago staff, including those on the analytics team. Davidsen said Obama hugged her and signed a favorite piece of cave paraphernalia, a replica of a narwhal tusk. “An honor,” she said.","When the campaign ended, Obama’s team of tech experts did not exactly knock down the door of the White House personnel office looking to put their newfound tools into the service of the new presidential agenda. They were heading East and West — to Silicon Valley, Wall Street and, in the case of A.M.G., Las Vegas — in search of venture capital and clients.","There is, of course, a tradition of political operatives leaving presidential campaigns to cash in on the corporate side. This has often been to join the public-policy campaigns of a given industry or company between political bouts, or perhaps to help with some brand and image management.","But there is just as much of a tradition in Democratic politics, especially among the young, to keep the fight alive after a campaign’s end. The young staff members of the McGovern campaign left that particularly demoralizing endeavor to re-engage with their causes and their party; the Web-pioneering Deaniacs went on to feed the ranks of MoveOn and the 2008 Obama campaign.","The Obama political movement had tended to hold itself apart from the corporate world, its members galvanized by what they saw as an opportunity to change the country. But after Election Day in November, huge political success met financial opportunity. The people in their 20s and 30s from the Obama tech team had seen others just like them get incredibly rich on innovations (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) that were as transformational as anything they could hope to achieve in government. Now they started to think about what innovations they could bring to the market.","A.M.G. may be the most baldly commercial of the new crop of companies coming out of the cave, but they are all trying to translate what they learned there into future success. A few weeks ago, Wagner announced he was starting a new firm called Civis Analytics with an investment from Eric Schmidt, the Google executive chairman, who was a technology adviser during the campaign. As Wagner described it to me, he would use analytics to help nonprofit and for-profit companies reach out to segments of the population they were struggling to connect with. One of his first clients is the College Board, which runs the national SAT test. Civis will identify “kids who are low-income, high-achieving but not meeting their college potential.” The “commercial applicability is wide,” he said, so the company will not be averse to working with big, for-profit companies of all kinds.","Carol Davidsen was also recruited by A.M.G., but she decided to take the lessons of the Obama campaign in a different direction. If anything, her approach is almost anticorporate, even though she said she was not against getting rich if she could. Her company, called Cir.cl, which she founded with a campaign programmer, Joshua Thayer, endeavors to find people with complementary interests who may have reason to do business with each other, like parents with baby equipment to dispose of and parents-to-be in the market for that equipment. She calls it “recommerce.”","“I have a lot of friends with kids,” she said one recent Friday at her new office, a bouncy-ball and Mac-strewn onetime closet space in an industrial building in Downtown Brooklyn. “There’s this little plastic play house. Does every single one of those need to go into a garbage dump? Why did we give up on doing business with each other? Why is it always to big corporations? It doesn’t have to be.” Explaining her choice to me, she said, “I don’t want to spend my time optimizing for Coke.”","When I talked to Chauncey McLean in Brooklyn in April, he walked me through how the campaign’s technological achievements could translate into services provided to private businesses, like Caesars. The casino had gobs of data on its customers. “We have a giant list of people, and we need to make a model of likely customers,” he said. A.M.G. would break them down along a range of Caesars Scores, à la Wagner’s persuadable scores. Then A.M.G. could work through it and direct advertising toward those whose visits had fallen off: find what they watch via Rentrak in the greatest concentrations and then ply them with TV advertising.","Over several meetings with McLean and his young A.M.G. staff members, I asked them to talk about the switch in mission from getting Obama elected to helping Fortune 500 companies sell stuff. Will St. Clair, who helped write the campaign’s Facebook program, said he saw himself as a programmer first and foremost and only joined A.M.G. after deciding that he didn’t want “to play the Internet start-up billionaire game, which is a lot less fun than it looks on paper.” Gaurav Shirole said he was considering a job in the Treasury Department when McLean approached him. “I’m a Silicon Valley kid, so the start-up bug has been there forever.”","Frommann acknowledged having ventured into politics with a certain idealism. “We’ve all watched ‘The West Wing,’ like, four times, and we want to do our small part to change the world,” he said. Politics, he said, was emotionally satisfying. Corporate clients meant new data sets, “stuff I haven’t worked with before, intellectually that’s interesting to me.”","Still, it was hard not to detect some deeper disappointment about what was possible in politics. Frommann told me that in 2010, shortly after college, he joined the Social Security Administration. Within a year, he had helped develop a new system that, he said, would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year. Just as his idea was gaining traction, his entire unit was disbanded, the ostensible result of budget cuts but also, he surmised, bureaucratic infighting. Sometimes, he said, it seems as if political life can be as much like “The West Wing” as it is like “House of Cards,” the Netflix show about a conniving member of Congress living in a kill-or-be-killed Washington.","McLean says Grisolano wooed him by awarding him with the title of chief operating officer and wide latitude to hire whomever he needed. He was also drawn to Grisolano’s sales pitch that the optimizer approach could prove a disruptive force in a $60 billion commercial-advertising industry. It spoke to the same desire to be part of something big that led him to join the first Obama campaign. “This is going to be a huge deal, right?” he said “It’s a multibillion-dollar industry, and we’re going to change the way that it works.”","He said his work at A.M.G. would also help provide the Democratic Party with even better tools three years from now, when he and his colleagues say they want to be involved in 2016. “We’re going to bring it home,” McLean said.","But for now, he does not seem to miss Washington. “I respect everybody who’s working for the president — right? They’re incredible kids — incredible people — but you have a limited movement, because you’re hamstrung; the House is the House,” he said. “When you go where the money is and you go where people get reached, you have a transformational effect. Money creates change.”","Jim Rutenberg is a national political correspondent for The New York Times."],"isopubdate":"2013-06-20"}
{"originalurl":"http://tech-inshorts.blogspot.com/2018/03/facebook-makes-its-privacy-data.html","title":"Facebook makes its privacy, data downloading and deletion settings easier to find","text":["Search This Blog","Subscribe to this blog","Follow by Email","With Facebook facing a wave of public backlash over how it has handled user data over the years — a backlash that was kicked off two weeks ago with the revelation that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had worked on targeted election campaigns using personal and private Facebook data — the company today announced a new set of changes to help users find and change their privacy settings, as well as download and delete whatever data has been collected through Facebook’s network of social media services.","To be clear, many of these settings and features already existed in Facebook, but now Facebook is making them significantly clearer for the average user to find and use. It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe.","What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.)","We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front.","For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place:","User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now.","Privacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that.","Downloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.","The news comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week posting an acknowledgement of Facebook’s role in the scandal, and a pledge to improve the company’s practices with regards to third-party apps and how Facebook works with them, and what data it will provide in the future, which he also followed up with a full-page apology printed in several newspapers. It has not been enough for some, and #deletefacebook has become a trending concept, with the company’s stock taking a nosedive in the last two weeks.","from Social – TechCrunch https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/facebook-data-privacy/","Reactions:","Google+ Followers","Popular Posts","Indian telecom operator Reliance Jio is in talks with Xiaomi to bring the Xiaomi Smart TVs in India along with the JioFiber bundle.

The move comes after a week a tumult at the world biggest social media site following revelations that political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had amassed Facebook user data for some 50 million people without ever getting their permission.","The social media giant has rolled out a new settings page for its mobile app and has also added a new dashboard called “Access Your Information” where users can find everything they’ve shared with or on Facebook in one place.","In addition to redesigning its settings menu on mobile devices, Facebook said it is creating a new privacy shortcut menu where users would be able to better secure their accounts and control personal information. It would also allow users to review and delete data they have shared, including posts and search queries.","Facebook’s new privacy settings page.","Here’s a simple breakdown of all new additions:","Privacy settings in one place: All the settings that used to spread across 20 different screens are accessible from a single one. Users will no longer have to dig through every single menu to find the requisite privacy setting.","Privacy Shortcuts menu: This brings settings like two-factor authentication, ad controls, tools to manage who sees your posts and controls for reviewing what you’ve shared under a single menu.","Secure download of all Facebook data: While this was already possible Facebook says that everything you download now including photos, contacts and posts could be migrated to another service. There are no details mentioned of how this migration will work.","Additionally, Facebook also plans to clarify the information being gathered by apps that hook into Facebook. Several seemingly innocent apps that allow users to play games with their friends or share photos could also be quietly monitoring their posts, interactions with friends, and contacts. In the new centralized page, people will be given a streamlined list of what each app is collecting on them, as well as the ability to delete the apps.","What is important to note here is that all these changes are cosmetic. Facebook hasn’t had a sudden change of heart and won’t alter the way it collects your data or serves you content. All of this information was available to users before, it was just scattered and buried in different pages that made it tougher to collect. The silver lining here is that it’ll be easier now for users to both offer an rescind their consent to Facebook on how it interacts with your data.","Facebook forced to move quickly","Facebook reportedly began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after the Cambridge Analytica revelations. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reignited fears over how much influence and power the social network has over its user base and how much it knows about them.","Facebook shares are down nearly 18% since March 16, the day of the revelation, eating away nearly $100 billion of the company’s market value.","“The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, a Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement announcing the new system. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.”","Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.”","Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information.","Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica either played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential election or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to help disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","…We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","“There’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.”","Responding to the allegations, Cambridge Analytica sent the following statement.","In 2014, SCL Elections contracted Dr. Kogan via his company Global Science Research (GSR) to undertake a large scale research project in the US. GSR was contractually committed to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR were also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. The language in the SCL Elections contract with GSR is explicit on these points. GSR subsequently obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, SCL Elections deleted all data it had received from GSR. For the avoidance of doubt, no data from GSR was used in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election.","Under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act (Unlawful obtaining etc. of personal data), a criminal offense has not been committed if a person has acted in the reasonable belief that he had in law the right to obtain data. GSR was a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding the its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections. It would be entirely incorrect to attempt to claim that SCL Elections","illegally acquired Facebook data. Indeed SCL Elections worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that SCL Elections had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s Terms of Service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-16"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

But it remains to be seen who will take direct action and whether or not any of these moves are the right decision.","Data = $$$","Bill Gates declared “Content is King” in an essay published to Microsoft’s website back in 1996. “Content is where I expect much of the real money will be made on the Internet, just as it was in broadcasting,” Gates wrote in the opening. But ask any internet-focused company in 2018, and the answer you’ll hear will most likely be data.","Data has become a business in itself. Founders look to find underserved areas, get as much data as they can, and therefore, become valuable. If Facebook, or another tech giant, doesn’t buy a startup to keep it a standalone service or just want to acqui-hire executives, the data itself becoming a part of Facebook’s empire can be reason enough. When French entrepreneur Thomas Pasquet thought about his next company in digital advertising after selling his startup, he looked at smartphones.","“A company that started war on mobile would be the company with the most access to data, the most comprehensive data,” Pasquet told Mashable.","In 2014, Pasquet started Ogury and has since collected more than 400 million mobile user profiles that helps it analyze how people use apps. For example, Ogury’s data suggested that Snapchat’s active user base dropped in January, with 82.7 percent of people who had it downloaded using the app at the beginning of the month and only 77 percent doing so on January 31. For an advertising agency, those consumer insights can be valuable. (Snapchat releases daily active user data on a quarterly basis, and the quarter including January has yet to be made public. However, Snapchat says it had 187 million daily active users in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, up from 178 million in the previous quarter.)","For Pasquet and Ogury, collecting more data can mean making more money. For Mintz and Looker, the overwhelming amount of data has created a business. Looker doesn’t provide new data sources. Rather, Looker is a tool that visualizes existing data sets.","“The things that got me excited about it were not the technical side of it but what it has empowered me to do. Data is the only way to make sense of what 7 or 8 million people want to do,” Mintz said.","Given that idea of scale, Mintz said he doesn’t see a future where data-fueled decisions and data-focused companies simply disappear. But change could come in how this information is collected and by what services.","Trust with transparency","While data can help advertisers — or anyone really — better understand the world, the scandal around Facebook and Cambridge Analytica stems from not being transparent about what exactly is happening behind the scenes.","Facebook users may have thought they were just taking a personality test for academic research or playing a fun cow game, but these actions led data scientists — not just the software engineers at Facebook — to have access to unsuspected users’ personal information.","“I think transparency is key to everything here. If you’re accessing someone’s data, I think it works best when they know why and what value you’re getting out of it,” said Patrick Ambron, CEO at BrandYourself.","Ambron’s business is fairly clear on how it makes money. That’s in part because it’s a subscription service rather than an advertising business like Facebook. BrandYourself sells a tool that scans people’s social media accounts and flags certain content as problematic.","“We’re a good case of it being a clear transaction of why you’re giving us your data, and you’re paying us money,” Ambron told Mashable.","Ogury also claims it is “clear” with user consent. All users are shown an agreement called “Consent to Collection and Use of Data,” which says that the data collected “may include information about your device, location, email, application, and browsing usage.” Pasquet, Ogury’s founder, said that at least one of three people reads the agreement and does not choose to opt into the tracking.","“At the start we said the consumers are smart, and we should ask them directly if they’re willing to share information,” Pasquet said.","On the other hand, Facebook users don’t necessarily understand exactly how their activities are being monitored and why. It can seem impossible to stop it even if you delete the app. Pasquet mentioned a frustrating example where someone could see a surprise vacation their significant other booked via online ad tracking. Impending UK regulations will create more data protections overseas, but data remains vulnerable in the U.S. and beyond, at least for now","Facebook could be forced or decide on its own to change that by updating its user agreement and surfacing it more often to its users, Ambron said. To prevent another Cambridge Analytica scandal, he also suggested creating stricter contracts with companies that use its data. Facebook should still make anonymized data available for academic researchers, like it’s doing with Stanford economics professor Raj Chetty’s America inequality study, but they need to do more thorough vetting and continuously audit, Ambron added.","“We as a society haven’t figured out yet how to keep the societal contract agile enough to keep up with the real rapid pace of change, and I think we have to,” Mintz said. “Technological change is not going to slow down, and it can’t just be a free for all.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

And that's not all that is wrong with what the meme.","Spilled milk","The lawsuit the meme refers to involved two married reporters -- Jane Akre and Steve Wilson -- and their former employer, WTVT Channel 13, a Fox affiliate in Tampa, Fla.","In 1996, the husband-and-wife team began reporting on the use of Posilac, a synthetic growth hormone in Florida dairy cattle developed by Monsanto. After eight months of back and forth between the reporters and the station, the story never aired, and the reporters were fired in 1997. Akre and Wilson sued the station for breach of contract and retaliatory firing in 1998.","Why the reporters lost their jobs is the heart of the case. According to Akre and Wilson, WTVT caved to pressure from Fox corporate and Monsanto, and fired the pair when Akre threatened to take what Akre described asthe station’s deliberate news distortion to the Federal Communications Commission. According to WTVT, the reporters submitted a biased and inaccurate report and were terminated after they refused to make the necessary edits.","In 2000, a Tampa jury ruled that WTVT did indeed retaliate against Akre and awarded her $425,000, the Tampa Bay Times (then the St. Petersburg Times) reported. WTVT then appealed the case. In 2003, the Florida Second District Court of Appeals reversed the ruling, arguing that Akre’s retaliation allegation did not hold water.","According to Akre, WTVT deliberately distorted news by airing a revised version of the Posilac story. That, Akre says, is prohibited under the false news provision. When Akre threatened to notify the FCC, the station fired her and breached the whistleblower statute that prohibits retaliation against employees who disclose an employer’s \"violation of law, rule, or regulation.\"","The station deniedrepeatedly that it had tried to broadcast distorted news and said it wanted fair and balanced reports from Akre and Wilson. WTVT argued that the FCC’s news distortion policy is more a rule of thumb than a codified law, and thus not under the purview of the whistleblower statute. The appeals court agreed.","Stuart Benjamin, a professor of telecommunications at Duke University, said he doesn’t see anything in the legal documents that suggests WTVT admitted to any lies or distortion. Rather, the station argued, and the court agreed, that Akre failed to meet her burden of proof, according to Benjamin.","\"If a statute prohibits me from hitting you only if I act with malice, and you say that I hit you but don’t establish malice, then I have a simple winning argument in court that you failed to show malice.That doesn’t mean I agree I hit you. It just means I have a winning argument that focuses on the absence of malice,\" he said.","Freedom of the press","Beyond what was in writing, Akre doesn’t remember WTVT admitting to lying and defending it as a legal right.","\"I don’t think they said it just like that, but they basically said we can do what we want,\" Akre told PunditFact. \"They kept saying ‘we have First Amendment rights,’ meaning they can operate with impunity and have the constitutional right to do so.\"","The First Amendment, as well as the Florida Constitution, \"prohibits judicial review of Defendants’ news judgments and the exercise of editorial discretion, consistent with the guarantees of a free press,\" the station argued in its defense statement.","What this means is that the court shouldn’t judge the editing choices of WTVT, the station’s lawyer Patricia Anderson told The Weekly Planet.","Anderson invoked the First Amendment because it is dangerous for the courts and the FCC to become involved in disputes between members of the media and tread on either party’s freedom of press rights, according to Alison Steele, a media lawyer and Anderson's’ former law partner. (Steele currently represents the Tampa Bay Times, which operates PunditFact.)","Deni Elliott, a professor of media ethics at the University of South Florida, said that by invoking the First Amendment, Fox is suggesting that they are not accountable to anyone -- \"not a reasonable stand for a news organization to take.\"","But to infer that WTVT used the First Amendment to defend news distortion and declare impunity is wrong. \"That wasn’t ever their position,\" Steele said.","\"There was never a factual or logical nexus established between the alleged crippling of the First Amendment and the firing of these two individuals,\" said Thomas McGowan, a media lawyer who was part of WTVT’s defense team.","Liane Casten, the reporter who wrote the the Chicago Media Watch article that originated the meme, said WTVT admitted to the false news allegations and defended it as a legal right during the trial, but could not recall the specifics. That position, however, is not corroborated by Akre.","Steele, who worked with WTVT’s attorney, said it’s possible lawyers conceded the point as a hypothetical. But it was never central to their legal argument, nor an admission in the sense Casten or the meme suggests.","\"I can certainly imagine that in oral argument. The other side says, ‘If you did do this,’ and you respond, ‘If I did, it doesn’t matter.’ That’s just part of the refining and defining what the legal argument,\" she said. \"This happens all the time, but it’s not an admission.\"","The ruling","The Internet meme claims, \"Fox admits they lie\" and, under the First Amendment, \"have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves.\"","The claim doesn't track back to the national cable network most people know. Instead, it's rooted in a wrongful termination lawsuit between a Tampa Fox affiliate and two reporters. The heart of the suit was whether the Fox affiliate wrongly fired the reporters over a story about a synthetic growth hormone in Florida dairy cattle.","The reporters and the station disagreed about the accuracy of the story.","As part of the lawsuit, lawyers for the station argued that the courts do not have the right to play referee on story decisions -- citing the First Amendment.","We found no evidence that the Fox affiliate admitted that it lied about the news it ultimately presented, and we certainly found no evidence that Fox News as a whole admits it lies (in the present tense).","While the Fox affiliate argued that it has the right to present the news as it chooses, it’s quite a leap to suggest Fox as a television corporation defended some right to \"distort news reports\" -- other than in a hypothetical sense to quash a wrongful termination suit.","This meme wasn’t conjured out of thin air, but it’s not accurate. We rate it False.","How to contact us","We want to hear your suggestions and comments. Email PunditFact with feedback and with claims you'd like to see checked.

In 2016, they were used to swing an election.","1. Trolling for fun and profit","Seventeen years ago, weblogs and social networks — what we’d eventually know as social media — were beginning to emerge. Giving everybody the ability to publish was still revolutionary, but not everybody was ready to create their own content from scratch. Writing a whole blog post, or uploading an original photo, was a high barrier to entry: an article could take hours or days, and not everybody had the skills or technology to take a beautiful digital photograph.","Memes were a neat solution: you clicked a few buttons, and suddenly had customized content to share on your blog. Correspondingly, weblogs began to fill up with dumb Cosmopolitan-style personality tests: What kind of girlfriend are you? Which Care Bear are you? Infuriated by the banality, I created a sort of parody, Which horrible affliction are you?, that deliberately trolled the blogosphere by allowing bloggers to declare themselves to be rickets or plague — and almost instantly became the most shared content online. I told the whole story in We Are the Monkeys of Rum.","My content was more viral for two reasons:","People really did prefer to post pre-made content than go through the time and effort of creating their own.","I trolled hard. A potential answer in Which evil criminal are you? was President Truman for dropping the atomic bomb. The resulting, often outrage-driven, conversation across blogs and Livejournal helped spread my links better than the content itself.","Over time, social media switched to concentrate on Twitter and Facebook, and my own interest waned in favor of other projects. The site was sold for a modest sum and we all moved on with our lives. Today, I support media startups that have the potential to create a more informed, inclusive, and empathetic society through Matter.","In particular, because modern social networks didn’t allow you to post HTML, building an adequate sharing mechanism for personality tests became more complicated. For real customization, you would probably need to actually build a Facebook integration, forcing users to authenticate and share their information.","We could see which sites (and therefore which people) were sharing our content; we could see how it was being discovered; we could know where in the world those people were. But by authenticating and adding a Facebook identity to each user, developers could learn a whole lot more.","2. Rise of the viral information scrapers","Facebook newsfeeds are filled with BuzzFeed quizzes and other oddball questionnaires that tell you which city you should actually live in, which ousted Arab Spring ruler you are, and which Hogwarts house you belong in. But these new online quizzes have a dark edge that their analog predecessors didn’t. In the wake of the U.S. election, a secretive data firm hired by Donald Trump’s campaign boasted that it has been using quizzes for years to gather personal information about millions of voters. Its goal: the creation of digital profiles that can predict — and possibly exploit — Americans’ values, anxieties, and political leanings.","When a user authenticated with a personality test app, their ID was transferred. Through the API, the app could determine that user’s interests, the content they had shared, and the IDs of their friends.","Their friends’ information could then also be scraped, and their likes and friends inferred.","Content could be posted to a user’s timeline, which would then recruit other friends to click through, authenticate, and continue the information crawl.","In 2015, Facebook moved from making these IDs universally available to using something called “app-scoped IDs”. In this new version of their API, a user has a new ID for every application they use, and their friends don’t have IDs if they’ve never used the app. This limits the scope of the crawler somewhat, as the base Facebook ID is unknowable to the app. Only users who have used the app can have their information crawled.","Regardless, according to reports, Steve Bannon approached the firm well before this API change, in late 2013, and a contract was signed in 2014. The likes and shares on a user’s timeline were cross-referenced with voter rolls and other information in order to build complete profiles. This is where a Cambridge Professor, Dr Alexsandr Kogan, helped: not with the information gathering itself, but with linking the acquired data across multiple sources to build more complete profiles.","Once voter records were mapped to Facebook profiles, they could be used as a corpus for detailed machine learning predictions, and controversial psychographic profiles, that could potentially suggest ways to sway opinions.","3. Dangerous by design","It is important to understand that Cambridge Analytica’s acquisition of 50 million user profiles is not an “information breach”, as has been widely reported.","Facebook has been designed to be an information-gathering engine in order to more effectively sell personalized advertising. Its algorithm also attempts to deeply understand your interests in order to “optimize for engagement”: keep you using the site, and therefore viewing those personalized ads, for as long as possible. Its users access Facebook for 50 minutes a day.","In order to gather the most information it can, Facebook has been engineered to be the world’s most efficient peer pressure engine. Users on the platform are constantly being persuaded to stay; those who try and leave report being relentlessly emailed with personalized, emotional content to try and get them to come back.","This coercive business model has created a network with three characteristics that make it particularly susceptible to being used as a backdoor for democracy:","It gathers as much information about as many people as possible in a single place. 2.2 billion people have Facebook accounts — and counting.","While Facebook’s API has intentionally been limited to reduce data scraping, this only applies for third-party companies. As a platform, Facebook itself has the ability to make any data inferences it wants, and to package it up as a service to its customers.","While the companies call it standard practice to work hand-in-hand with high-spending advertisers like political campaigns, the new research details how the staffers assigned to the 2016 candidates frequently acted more like political operatives, doing things like suggesting methods to target difficult-to-reach voters online, helping to tee up responses to likely lines of attack during debates, and scanning candidate calendars to recommend ad pushes around upcoming speeches.","All of this activity is powered by deep mines of data about every single one of us.","Elections have become information warfare battlegrounds, fought using all of our personal details without our consent. Here, the weapons are vast data silos like Facebook and Twitter, alongside open, anonymous marketplaces for highly targeted advertising.","Rather than building a surveillance state controlled from the top down, we’ve all opted into a bottom-up global surveillance society that tracks our activity, interests, and personal networks far more efficiently than any police state ever could. We’re all complicit in building the database of us.","For ethical technologists, one solution is to build security-conscious platforms that aren’t susceptible to this kind of viral abuse — and that certainly don’t rely on them as a business model.","For conscious consumers, one solution is to engage with social networks and apps that actively protect your privacy. (And for smart technology companies to band together to create a kind of Fairtrade label for responsible data use.)","For legislators, one solution is to pass new laws regulating how data is gathered and used.","For all of us, one solution is to band together and use our social power as consumers and citizens to refuse to allow platforms to be built in this way any longer. Democracy is too important, and our freedoms too precious, to be chipped away by social media apps — let alone asinine personality tests designed to learn about you as easily as they spread.","In some ways, for startup founders, for engineers, for users, and for legislators, the current moment is the most important personality test of all:","What kind of citizen are you?","This is a personal blog post, but you should know that I want to invest in new kinds of platforms that create a more informed, inclusive, and empathetic society. Applications for the Matter accelerator are open now. We can do better than build platforms that can be gamed in this way. Let’s change media for good."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","...On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data.","The basics of the story are this: In 2013-14, the young firm called Cambridge Analytica had backing from the right-wing billionaire, Robert Mercer; a rising political force in its association with the Breitbart News impresario Steve Bannon; a bold mission to, in the words of one former employee, \"fight a culture war in America\" and a scheme to use state-of-the-art Big Data and psychological profiling to win elections with modern propaganda.","What CA lacked, however, was the data the pull this off. That's when what Facebook's top lawyer has now acknowledged was \"a scam — and a fraud\" came into play. Wylie — the young political data maven now turned whistleblower — and the team assembled by Mercer and Bannon turned to experts in \"psychometrics\" at Britain's Cambridge University; there, a Russian American (heh … a bit more on that later) professor named Aleksandr Kogan was hired for $800,000. Kogan reportedly then lied to Facebook about his real project — a personality quiz and an app that 270,000 people consented to but which allowed the firm to pull Facebook \"likes\" and other personal info from 50 million unsuspecting Americans. (The company also seems to have lied to Facebook about later destroying the data.)","According to the newspapers, Cambridge Analytica ultimately created about 30 million usable profiles for voters — who were then targeted in the 2016 election with the kind of psychological warfare that the Pentagon has honed for decades to use on our enemies.","In 2016, the enemy was us.","Craig Timberg and Tony Romm at the Washington Post: Facebook May Have Violated FTC Privacy Deal, Say Former Federal Officials, Triggering Risk of Massive Fines. \"Two former federal officials who crafted the landmark consent decree governing how Facebook handles user privacy say the company may have violated that decree when it shared information from tens of millions of users with a data analysis firm that later worked for [Donald] Trump's 2016 campaign. ...On Sunday morning, [David Vladeck, who as the director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the subsequent consent decree resolving the case in 2011] said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook's sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica 'raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.'\"","[CN: Video may autoplay at link] Matt Rosoff at CNBC: Facebook Is Facing Its Biggest Test Ever — and Its Lack of Leadership Could Sink the Company. \"For more than a year now, Facebook has been deflecting stories about how its platform was used during the 2016 presidential election.

Most notably, a U.S. grand jury recently indicted 13 Russian nationals for conducting a disinformation campaign on American soil intended to further political divisions in the country and sway the election toward Trump. Their tactics included using Facebook groups to organize divisive political protests and buying targeted ads.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","...On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data.","The basics of the story are this: In 2013-14, the young firm called Cambridge Analytica had backing from the right-wing billionaire, Robert Mercer; a rising political force in its association with the Breitbart News impresario Steve Bannon; a bold mission to, in the words of one former employee, \"fight a culture war in America\" and a scheme to use state-of-the-art Big Data and psychological profiling to win elections with modern propaganda.","What CA lacked, however, was the data the pull this off. That's when what Facebook's top lawyer has now acknowledged was \"a scam — and a fraud\" came into play. Wylie — the young political data maven now turned whistleblower — and the team assembled by Mercer and Bannon turned to experts in \"psychometrics\" at Britain's Cambridge University; there, a Russian American (heh … a bit more on that later) professor named Aleksandr Kogan was hired for $800,000. Kogan reportedly then lied to Facebook about his real project — a personality quiz and an app that 270,000 people consented to but which allowed the firm to pull Facebook \"likes\" and other personal info from 50 million unsuspecting Americans. (The company also seems to have lied to Facebook about later destroying the data.)","According to the newspapers, Cambridge Analytica ultimately created about 30 million usable profiles for voters — who were then targeted in the 2016 election with the kind of psychological warfare that the Pentagon has honed for decades to use on our enemies.","In 2016, the enemy was us.","Craig Timberg and Tony Romm at the Washington Post: Facebook May Have Violated FTC Privacy Deal, Say Former Federal Officials, Triggering Risk of Massive Fines. \"Two former federal officials who crafted the landmark consent decree governing how Facebook handles user privacy say the company may have violated that decree when it shared information from tens of millions of users with a data analysis firm that later worked for [Donald] Trump's 2016 campaign. ...On Sunday morning, [David Vladeck, who as the director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the subsequent consent decree resolving the case in 2011] said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook's sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica 'raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.'\"","[CN: Video may autoplay at link] Matt Rosoff at CNBC: Facebook Is Facing Its Biggest Test Ever — and Its Lack of Leadership Could Sink the Company. \"For more than a year now, Facebook has been deflecting stories about how its platform was used during the 2016 presidential election. Some of this activity — like Facebook embedding workers with the Trump campaign to tell them how to advertise more effectively — was perfectly legal... Other activity was against Facebook's policies, or outright illegal. Most notably, a U.S. grand jury recently indicted 13 Russian nationals for conducting a disinformation campaign on American soil intended to further political divisions in the country and sway the election toward Trump. Their tactics included using Facebook groups to organize divisive political protests and buying targeted ads. CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has remained aloof throughout the whole sequence of events.\"","Fucking hell.","As you may recall, Jared Kushner has previously bragged about working with Cambridge Analytica and he is potentially being investigated for leveraging the campaign's data operation to help select Facebook targets for the Russians.","* * *","What is the @nytimes even doing with this headline?

(No shit, General Sherlock.) \"Retired U.S. Army general Barry McCaffrey says he can't remain quiet any longer. Late Friday, the respected four-star general sounded an alarm about uncomfortably close relations between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, warning in a tweet that the U.S. president appears to be 'for some unknown reason under the sway of Mr. Putin.'\"","Reluctantly I have concluded that President Trump is a serious threat to US national security.

Then a senator from Alabama, Sessions chaired the meeting as head of the Trump campaign's foreign policy team.","\"Yes, I pushed back,\" Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 14, when asked whether he shut down Papadopoulos' proposed outreach to Russia.","Sessions has since also been interviewed by Mueller.","Three people who attended the March campaign meeting told Reuters they gave their version of events to FBI agents or congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although the accounts they provided to Reuters differed in certain respects, all three, who declined to be identified, said Sessions had expressed no objections to Papadopoulos' idea.","One person said Sessions was courteous to Papadopoulos and said something to the effect of \"okay, interesting.\"","The other two recalled a similar response.","...The three accounts, which have not [previously] been reported, raise new questions about Sessions' testimony regarding contacts with Russia during the campaign.","Sessions previously failed to disclose to Congress meetings he had with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and testified in October that he was not aware of any campaign representatives communicating with Russians.","In other words, this may be the second time that Sessions has perjured himself.

Filed False NYC Housing Paperwork. \"When the Kushner Cos. bought three apartment buildings in a gentrifying neighborhood of Queens in 2015, most of the tenants were protected by special rules that prevent developers from pushing them out, raising rents, and turning a tidy profit.

Now a clue has emerged as to how [Donald] Trump's son-in-law's firm was able to move so fast: The Kushner Cos. routinely filed false paperwork with the city declaring it had zero rent-regulated tenants in dozens of buildings it owned across the city when, in fact, it had hundreds.\"","Michael Kranish and Karen DeYoung at the Washington Post: Kushner Companies Confirms Meeting with Qatar on Financing. \"Jared Kushner's father met with Qatar's finance minister three months after [Donald] Trump's inauguration, a New York City session at which funding for a financially troubled real estate project was discussed, the company acknowledged Sunday.

But she believed Trump was a good person, and she was angered that his critics didn't seem open to the parts of his personality that would lead them to believe the same.

Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebook’s official post.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” the added language argued.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","While the language is up for debate, lawmakers don’t appear to be looking kindly on Facebook’s arguably legitimate effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)","While most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I’ve called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.","On Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”","Just what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Now, Facebook wants to make the process of managing a user's data more streamlined through a portal called \"Access Your Information.\"","Users will be able to see their every action on Facebook and decide if they want to delete it. That includes every like, message, event response, and any other mundane action on Facebook that could be used to profile a person.","The idea is to make it more useful for people to take control of their information, allowing them to see what Facebook has collected — and to wipe the slate clean, if they so choose.","A single screen for settings","Settings can be a tricky and less-than-intuitive place for users to navigate. Facebook's mobile settings were previously spread across nearly 20 screens, but will now be condensed into one.","Users will be able to jump right into their personal information or change their password in the security section, among other actions, instead of going through layers to find the one setting they really need.","Privacy shortcuts","This is Facebook's one-stop shop for finding more information about privacy, security and ads. Privacy shortcuts have been around for a few years (you may recall the cartoon dinosaur mascot Facebook attached to them).","The Privacy Shortcuts menu is also getting a simplified makeover to make the experience more visual and easier to navigate.","This is the menu where users can manage their audiences for various posts and review friend requests they've sent, posts they've reacted to, and other actions, all with just a few taps. Don't like something? Facebook will let users delete it here.","The revised menu also provides some practical security options, enabling users to turn on two-factor authentication, which requires them to enter a code sent to their phone when they log in from a new device, creating an extra layer of security.","Facebook says the new tools are just the start. In the coming weeks, they're planning other measures to be more transparent, including an updated policy about the data they collect and how it is used, along with proposed updates to Facebook's terms of service that underscore the social network's commitments to its users."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

It may not be a huge amount for one single person, but when you count up how many emails are being sent each day and how many social media users exist around the world, that amount suddenly becomes very big.","It’s estimated that by 2021, there will be 3.02 billion users of social media. That’s 41% of the world’s population. Facebook say that each of their users emits 299g of CO2 per year. Not bad. But for 3.02 billions users?

Within the menu, users can review and delete what they have shared, manage ad preferences, and control who sees their page, among other features.","Data deletion tools","Facebook is also debuting tools to find, download and delete your data.","Egan and Beringer said: “Some people want to delete things they’ve shared in the past, while others are just curious about the information Facebook has. So, we’re introducing Access Your Information – a secure way for people to access and manage their information, such as posts, reactions and comments, and things you’ve searched for. You can go here to delete anything from your timeline or profile that you no longer want on Facebook.”","They added: “We’re also making it easier to download the data you’ve shared with Facebook – it’s your data, after all.

{"originalurl":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/facebook-cambridge-analytica/555866/?utm_source=fbb","title":"Cambridge Analytica and the Dangers of Facebook Data-Harvesting - The Atlantic","text":["On Friday night, Facebook suspended the account of Cambridge Analytica, the political-data company backed by the billionaire Robert Mercer that consulted on both the Brexit and Trump campaigns.","The action came just before The Guardian and The New York Timesdropped major reports in which the whistle-blower Christopher Wylie alleged that Cambridge Analytica had used data that an academic had allegedly improperly exfiltrated from the social network. These new stories, backed by Wylie’s account and internal documents, followed years of reporting by The Guardianand The Intercept about the possible problem.","The details could seem Byzantine. Aleksandr Kogan, then a Cambridge academic, founded a company, Global Science Research, and immediately took on a major client, Strategic Communication Laboratories, which eventually gave birth to Cambridge Analytica. (Steve Bannon, an adviser to the company and a former senior adviser to Trump, reportedly picked the name.)","The promise of Kogan’s company was that they could build psychological profiles of vast numbers of people by using Facebook data. Those profiles, in turn, might be useful to tune the political messages that Cambridge Analytica sent to potential voters. Perhaps a certain kind of message might appeal more to extroverts, or narcissists, or agreeable people.","To gather that data, the Times reports, Kogan hired workers through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to install a Facebook app in their accounts. The app, built by Global Science Research, requested an unusual (but not unheard-of) amount of data about users themselves and their friends. That’s how 270,000 Turkers ended up yielding 30 million profiles of American Facebook users that could be matched with other data sets.","From the current reporting, it seems that Kogan violated Facebook’s terms of service in saying he was using the data for academic research, but then selling it to Strategic Communications Laboratories. That’s what got Cambridge Analytica and Kogan in trouble. (Cambridge Analytica told The Guardian that they do not have possession of the data nor did they use any of this data in the 2016 election. An anonymous source in the Times story disputes this.)","There’s a lot about Cambridge Analytica that doesn’t quite add up. Are they data geniuses who swung the Brexit vote and got Trump elected, or pretenders bluffing their way to fat marketing contracts? Right after the election, several stories pointed to their psychological profiles of voters as a crucial piece of the Trump digital machine. As time has gone on, their role has come to be seen as less important, more in line with the tiny slice of the Trump campaign treasury that they got, roughly $6 million.","While the specifics of this particular violation are important to understand, the story reveals deeper truths about the online world that operates through and within Facebook.","First, some of Facebook’s growth has been driven by apps, which the company found extended the amount of time that people spent on the platform, as retired users of FarmVille could attest. To draw developers, Facebook had quite lax (or, as one might say, “developer-friendly”) data policies for years.","Academic researchers began publishing warnings that third-party Facebook apps represented a major possible source of privacy leakage in the early 2010s. Some noted that the privacy risks inherent in sharing data with apps were not at all clear to users. One group termed our new reality “interdependent privacy,” because your Facebook friends, in part, determine your own level of privacy.","For as long as apps have existed, they have asked for a lot of data and people have been prone to give it to them. Back in 2010, Penn State researchers systematically recorded what data the top 1,800 apps on Facebook were asking for. They presented their results in 2011 with the paper “Third-Party Apps on Facebook: Privacy and the Illusion of Control.” The table below shows that 148 apps were asking for permission to access friends’ information.","Pennsylvania State University","But that’s not the only way that friends leak their friends’ data. Take the example of letting an app see your photos. As the Penn State researchers show, all kinds of data can be harvested: who’s tagged in photos, who liked any of the pictures, who commented on them, and what they said.","If one were to systematically crawl through all the data that could be gleaned from just a user’s basic information, one could build a decent picture of that person’s social world, including a substantial amount of information about their friends.","Facebook has tightened up some of its policies in recent years, especially around apps accessing friends’ data. But TheGuardian’s reporting suggests that the company’s efforts to restuff Pandora’s box have been lax. Wylie, the whistleblower, received a letter from Facebook asking him to delete any Facebook data nearly two years after the existence of the data was first reported. “That to me was the most astonishing thing,” Wylie told The Guardian. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","But even if Facebook were maximally aggressive about policing this kind of situation, what’s done is done. It’s not just that the data escaped, but that Cambridge Analytica almost certainly learned everything they could from it. As stated in The Guardian, the contract between GSR and Strategic Communications Laboratories states, specifically, “The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information.”","It’s important to dwell on this. It’s not that this research was supposed to identify every U.S. voter just from this data, but rather to develop a method for sorting people based on Facebook’s profiles. Wylie believes that the data was crucial in building Cambridge Analytica’s models. It certainly seems possible that once the “training set” had been used to learn how to psychologically profile people, this specific data itself was no longer necessary. But the truth is that no one knows if the Kogan data had much use out in the real world of political campaigning. Psychological profiling sounds nefarious, but the way that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica first attempted to do it may well have proven, as the company maintains, “fruitless.”","So what is to be done? It’s possible that these new stories will cause Facebook to restrict the use of its data by people outside the company, including legitimate researchers. But that kind of self-imposed or external regulation would not strike at what’s actually scary about these efforts.","If Cambridge Analytica’s targeted advertising works, people worry they could be manipulated with information—or even thoughts—that they did not consent to giving anyone. And societally, a democracy running on micro-targeted political advertisements tuned specifically for ever tinier slices of the population is in trouble, as scholars like Zeynep Tufekci warned in 2012 (and in 2014).","Those two concerns extend far beyond Cambridge Analytica. In fact, the best system for micro-targeting ads, political or otherwise, to particularly persuadable segments of the population is Facebook itself. This is why Facebook’s market value is half a trillion dollars.","In Facebook’s ad system, there are no restrictions on sending ads to people based on any “targetable” attribute, like older men who are interested in the “Confederate States of America” and the National Rifle Association and who are “likely to engage with political content (conservative).”","A screenshot from Facebook’s ad-purchasing platform (Alexis Madrigal)","That’s to say nothing of the ability to create databases of people from other sources—electoral rolls, data on purchasing habits or group affiliations, or anything gleaned by the hundreds of online data companies—then letting Facebook itself match those people up to their Facebook accounts. Facebook might never reveal the names in an audience to advertisers or political campaigns, but the effects are the same.","Facebook’s laxity and the researcher’s malfeasance are newsworthy. But is the problem with privacy-obviating social networks, psychological profiling, and political micro-targeting that some researcher violated Facebook’s terms of service? Or is it that this controversy estranges the whole enterprise, providing a route to approach the almost unthinkable changes that have come to democratic processes in the Facebook era?","We want to hear what you think about this article.

Scepticism has become the order of the day in our post-truth society. This is the price paid for dealing in lies and tolerating them.","Jesus said: “If I say the truth, why do you not believe Me?” John 8:46.","Such was their prejudice that He said: “Because I tell you the truth, you do not believe Me” John 8:45.","Jesus diagnosed their problem: “But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you” John 5:42.","After a dumbed-down EU (Brexit) referendum campaign based on soundbites (because these are all that the public will pay attention to), some people woke up to a result that they did not like, and then blamed the politicians for not giving the information they think the other side needed, but more especially blaming the other side for lies in their campaign. If the result had gone the way they wanted, they would care little about the lies.","So it is little wonder that such people pay so little attention to Christianity. Similarly they will wake up too late to discover that they are on the wrong side of history and of eternity. Then they will blame God for not telling them more forcefully about the truth. God knows how to answer them, but in the meantime don’t waste your time and use it properly.","Jesus also said: “But now you seek to kill Me, a man Who has told you the truth” John 8:40. This ungodly behaviour is so well known that it is proverbial to ‘kill the messenger for bringing the message’.","This shows the inherent wickedness as well as the folly in human beings.","It is a basic principle of Christianity to teach critical thinking by promoting the truth and belief of the truth. Christians learn to distinguish truth from error.","Yet, for some people, the prospect of eternal life in heaven is ‘too good to be true’, so they will not believe it, nor will they examine it.","Possibly this is explained by their thinking that Jesus Christ is ‘too good to be true’. So they will not believe in Him either.","So Jesus says: “If you do not believe that I am the Messiah, you shall die in your sins” John 8:24.","The angel of the Lord told Joseph: “She (Mary) shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people from their sins” Mat 1:21. Jesus came to save His people from their sins, but if you die in your sins then you will spend eternity in your sins without any escape from them and their consequences.","Search","Search for:","Interesting searches to start you off","Text in red is a hyperlink; just click on the red text to learn more.

By exploiting this, an attacker could have gained access to the victim’s Tinder account, who must have used their phone number to log in.","This could have been exploited through a vulnerability in Facebook’s Account Kit, which Facebook has recently addressed.","Both Tinder’s web and mobile applications allow users to use their mobile phone numbers to log into the service. And this login service is provided by Account Kit (Facebook).","Login Service Powered by Facebook’s Accountkit on Tinder","The user clicks on Login with Phone Number on tinder.com and then they are redirected to Accountkit.com for login.

It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information.

{"originalurl":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/16/facebook-suspends-cambridge-analytica-the","title":"Facebook suspends Cambridge Analytica, the data analysis firm that worked on the Trump campaign – TechCrunch","text":["Facebook suspends Cambridge Analytica, the data analysis firm that worked on the Trump campaign","Facebook announced late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories, and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica — which used Facebook data to target voters for President Donald Trump’s campaign in the 2016 election. In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.”","Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.”","Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information.","Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica either played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential election or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to help disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","…We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","“There’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.”","Responding to the allegations, Cambridge Analytica sent the following statement.","In 2014, SCL Elections contracted Dr. Kogan via his company Global Science Research (GSR) to undertake a large scale research project in the US. GSR was contractually committed to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR were also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. The language in the SCL Elections contract with GSR is explicit on these points. GSR subsequently obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, SCL Elections deleted all data it had received from GSR. For the avoidance of doubt, no data from GSR was used in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election.","Under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act (Unlawful obtaining etc. of personal data), a criminal offense has not been committed if a person has acted in the reasonable belief that he had in law the right to obtain data. GSR was a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding the its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections. It would be entirely incorrect to attempt to claim that SCL Elections","illegally acquired Facebook data. Indeed SCL Elections worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that SCL Elections had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s Terms of Service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-16"}

The “behavioural microtargeting” company has also received around $2.5m over the past two years from conservative Super Pacs to which Mercer or members of his family have donated.","In an interview with the Guardian last month, Cruz said his funding and outreach apparatus “is very much the Obama model – a data-driven, grassroots-driven campaign – and it is a reason why our campaign is steadily gathering strength”.","Cruz is increasingly seen as a leading Republican contender, uniting factions within the party beyond his evangelical and Tea Party base. In Iowa – the first state to vote in the presidential primary, in less than two months – the outspoken Texas senator dethroned Trump in a poll for the first time this week as the mogul became ensnared in yet more controversy.","Cambridge Analytica has also worked with the Republican candidate Ben Carson, receiving $220,000 from his campaign earlier this year. But the company is more closely involved in Cruz’s presidential bid, with a team of its data scientists currently working at Cruz campaign headquarters in Houston.","Having donated $11m to the main pro-Cruz Super Pac, Keep the Promise I, Mercer is Cruz’s top financier – and the largest individual donor to Super Pacs or outside groups during the presidential election cycle thus far, according to data compiled by the political transparency website Open Secrets.","Mercer’s connections to both the Cruz campaign and the data firm that is apparently helping to power the senator’s advantages were previously reported by Politico and Bloomberg. But political strategists and privacy advocates agreed that Mercer’s parallel funding channels, combined with concerns over the surreptitious, commodified Facebook data – reported here for the first time – represented an intensified collision of billionaire financing and digital targeting on the campaign trail.","“If people begin to be turned off by Trump, the Cruz campaign will probably have a better strategic understanding of the implications and how to capitalize upon them,” said Bud Jackson, a Democratic specialist in digital grassroots campaigning, when asked to review the relationships. “Where a candidate’s campaign may be afraid to go outside the boundaries of ethical behaviour because of a potential public backlash, an outside group may be less afraid.”","In an interview, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler said the campaign had contracted Cambridge Analytica “because they’re a market leader and best in the field” but that officials had “done our due diligence”.","“My understanding is all the information is acquired legally and ethically with the permission of the users when they sign up to Facebook,” he said, referring questions about previous research to Cambridge Analytica.","The Guardian contacted Cambridge Analytica prior to publication via email with its findings and a list of detailed questions. Repeated calls were also made to its offices in Washington and New York, as well as its parent company in London. A representative in New York refused to speak with the Guardian and hung up the phone.","After this article was published, Facebook said the company was “carefully investigating this situation” regarding the Cruz campaign.","“[M]isleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do, including banning those companies from Facebook and requiring them to destroy all improperly collected data,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement to the Guardian.","Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist and senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, described the Guardian’s findings as “troubling” and highlighted shortcomings by the FEC to adequately regulate campaigns’ use of data.","“What it essentially means is there is no one regulating campaigns’ privacy data and security practices,” he said. “So it means you have a wild west, where the campaigns can do whatever they want and get away with it.”","Research that seeded data on millions","Documents seen by the Guardian show Cambridge Analytica’s parent, a London-based company called Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL), was first introduced to the concept of using social media data to model human personality traits in early 2014 by Dr Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer at Cambridge University’s renowned psychology department.","Kogan established his own company in spring that year and began working with SCL to deliver a “large research project” in the US. His stated aim was to get as close to every US Facebook user into the dataset as possible.","The academic used Amazon’s crowdsourcing marketplace Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to access a large pool of Facebook profiles, hoovering up tens of thousands of individuals’ demographic data – names, locations, birthdays, genders – as well as their Facebook “likes”, which offer a range of personal insights.","This was achieved by recruiting MTurk users by paying them about one dollar to take a personality questionnaire that gave access to their Facebook profiles. This raised the alarm among some participants, who flagged Kogan for violating MTurk’s terms of service. “They want you to log into Facebook and then download a bunch of your information,” complained one user at the time.","Crucially, Kogan also captured the same data for each person’s unwitting friends. For every individual recruited on MTurk, he harvested information about their friends, meaning the dataset ballooned significantly in size. Research shows that in 2014, Facebook users had an average of around 340 friends.","Kogan assured the MTurk users their Facebook data would “only be used for research purposes” and remain “anonymous and safe”.","However, the Facebook data was then used to generate sophisticated models of each of their personalities using the so-called “big five” personality traits and characteristics – openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism (known as the OCEAN scale).","By summer 2014, Kogan’s company had created an expansive and powerful dataset. His business partner boasted on LinkedIn that their private outfit, Global Science Research (GSR), “owns a massive data pool of 40+ million individuals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles”.","Documents show SCL agreed to a contract with GSR, whereby it would pay its data collection costs in order to improve “match rates” against SCL’s existing datasets or to enhance GSR’s algorithm’s “national capacity to profile capacity of American citizens”.","In an email, Kogan said he was unable to explain in detail where all the data came from, as he was restricted by various confidentiality agreements. He said SCL is no longer a client.","He said that while GSR often used MTurk for data collection, it “never collected more than a couple thousand responses on MTurk for any one project, or even across all projects for a single client – the vast majority of our MTurk data collection as a company is in the form of surveys only”. He said GSR stores Facebook data anonymously.","Kogan explained that separate from his university role, his private company undertook various commercial ventures relating to data analysis. He said that when GSR collect Facebook data, the terms detail the use that information collected will be put to and make clear to participants that they are giving GSR full permission to use the data and user contribution for any purpose.","He said Cambridge University had “no knowledge of the clients or projects GSR had worked on” and that GSR has never used any data collected as part of his university activities.","‘Packaging voters like they’re consumers’","Today, Cambridge Analytica’s central offering to US politicians is to enable them to use the OCEAN scale in shaping highly targeted campaign messages. This allows candidates like Cruz to campaign on specific issues, but communicate them in multiple ways to different audiences depending on the personal information the company holds about them.","As the company’s CEO, Alexander Nix, explains in a promotional video: “The more you know about someone, the more you can align a campaign with their requirements or their wants and needs.” He did not respond to a request for comment.","Michael Zimmer, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where he specialises in privacy and internet ethics, described this as a “particularly problematic” kind of voter targeting that raised broader concerns in the US about “packaging voters like they’re consumers”.","“It’s one thing for a marketer to try to predict if people like Coke or Pepsi,” he said, “but it’s another thing for them to predict things that are much more central to our identity and what’s more personal in how I interact with the world in terms of social and cultural issues.”","Prior to its relationship with Cruz, Cambridge Analytica worked with a handful of 2014 midterm candidates, according to FEC filings. The firm also secured hundreds of thousands of dollars of business with John Bolton’s Super Pac, formed by the hawkish former UN ambassador to support conservative candidates campaigning on national security issues.","Last week, the Cruz campaign launched a combative TV ad timed to air during a major college football game in Iowa. In the 30-second ad, Cruz vows: “We’ll rebuild our military, we’ll kill the terrorists and every Islamic militant will know – if you wage jihad against us, you’re signing your death warrant.”","Tyler, the Cruz spokesman, said Cambridge Analytica did not work on television advertising for the campaign. “They’re helping with online targeting and messaging, and that’s how we find people online,” he said.","It remains unclear when Mercer’s involvement with Cambridge Analytica began, but FEC filings show the company started working with Super Pacs that the secretive conservative donor has backed during the second half of 2014.","On Wednesday in Washington, Cruz was the only member of the Senate armed services committee to skip a hearing on US strategy to combat the Islamic State. Instead, he travelled to attend a fundraising luncheon in New York hosted by the president of Keep the Promise I, the Super Pac funded by Mercer that, one day earlier, had announced a $600,000 digital advertising strategy to be rolled out via social media in early voting states."],"isopubdate":"2015-12-11"}

On Saturday, we learned why: The firm played a role in secretly harvesting data belonging to more than 50 million users.","On Sunday, a third bomb dropped: Joseph Chancellor, currently a researcher at Facebook, may be connected to this whole mess.","A Sunday report from CNN reveals that Chancellor previously served as a director of Global Science Research (GSR). When whistleblower Christopher Wylie teamed up with Cambridge University's Aleksandr Kogan to develop an app that could harvest Facebook user data, GSR was the company that data funneled through.","It's not clear what Chancellor knew about GSR's data collection practices, if he knew anything. CNN points out that Chancellor and Kogan were both listed as directors when GSR incorporated in May 2014, according to U.K. government records, but Cambridge Analytica claims \"no recollection\" of any emails or calls with Chancellor.","Kogan and Wylie have both been suspended from Facebook while the investigation plays out. Chancellor, who hasn't personally commented, continues to work at Facebook, and the social media company confirmed to CNN that it is \"looking into the situation.\"","In 2014, Kogan and Wylie built an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" that paid participants for taking a personality test. The data gathered from these tests — which required test-takers to link the app with their Facebook profiles — was ostensibly to be used for academic purposes.","In reality, it formed the data-driven backbone of software that Cambridge Analytica used to profile U.S. voters and serve them personalized ads ahead of the 2016 election.","These facts emerged when Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, opted to blow the whistle on his past work in an interview with The Observer. Along with the story, he shared with the paper a dossier containing emails, bank records, and other evidence pointing to GSR's data collection and the company's connection to Cambridge Analytica.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

The share plunge erased $5billion from the net worth of Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg as calls for investigations came on both sides of the Atlantic after Facebook responded to the explosive reports of misuse of its data by suspending the account of Cambridge Analytica, a British firm hired by Trump’s 2016 campaign.","Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy called for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to appear before Congress, along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter. The two lawmakers said the companies “have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data” and that the lack of oversight “raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights.”","Senator Ron Wyden asked Facebook to provide more information on what he called a “troubling” misuse of private data that could have been used to sway voters. Wyden said he wants to know how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook tools “to weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.”","In Europe, officials voiced similar outrage. Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, called the revelations “horrifying, if confirmed,” and vowed to address concerns in the United States this week. In Britain, parliamentary committee chair Damian Collins said both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook had questions to answer.","“We have repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular whether data had been taken from people without their consent,” Collins said in a statement. Their answers have consistently understated this risk, and have also been misleading to the committee.” Alexander Nix is chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, which has denied misusing Facebook data for its work on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research said the revelations highlight “systemic problems at Facebook,” but that they won’t immediately impact the social network’s revenues."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/1Nf3XsY?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.00849fa09e67","title":"Mark Zuckerberg should spend $45 billion on undoing Facebook’s damage to democracies - The Washington Post","text":["Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has announced that he wants to give away $45 billion. I’m sure he needs some advice on how to spend it. Here’s mine: He should use it to undo the terrible damage done by Facebook and other forms of social media to democratic debate and civilized discussion all over the world.","Weak democracies are the most vulnerable to the curse of Facebook. I was recently at a gathering of experts who work in post-conflict countries, and all present agreed: Reconstructing a nation — any nation, whether Libya or East Timor — requires the establishment of a framework for national debate. If nothing else, leaders of the conflict have to agree about why the war ended, why they decided to stop fighting and what will happen next. Then they have to transmit that agreement to their followers. But if this is impossible — because “mainstream” media don’t exist, because Facebook offers conflicting versions of the truth, because no one trusts what they read — then peace is impossible, too.","Poor democracies are equally vulnerable. In countries — and there are more than you think — where reputable, fact-checked, independent media don’t function (because they’re too expensive, because the Internet destroyed the advertising market, because illiberal governments put pressure on the media), then the possibility of civilized conversation disappears, too. If different versions of the truth appear in different online versions; if no one can agree upon what actually happened yesterday; if fake, manipulated or mendacious news websites are backed up by mobs of Internet trolls; then conspiracy theories, whether of the far left or far right, will soon have the same weight as reality. Politicians who lie will be backed by a claque of supporters.","Rich democracies haven’t realized that this is also fast becoming their problem. Whenever I’ve described the disappearance of facts and the growth of Internet fantasy while in London or Washington, the response has usually been rather smug: How very terrible for all of those people in Tunisia or Slovakia, but “it couldn’t happen here.” But it can and it has: Donald Trump claimed that “thousands” of Muslims in New Jersey cheered the collapse of the World Trade Center, and thousands of real commenters and bloggers rushed to his defense on Facebook and elsewhere. Never mind that it didn’t happen: It is now possible to live in a virtual reality where Trump’s lies are acclaimed as the hidden truth that the mainstream media have concealed from the masses.","Those who don’t live in Trump’s world can find alternatives, of course. Ali Amin, a Virginia teenager, was so entranced by the world of online jihad that he became “absorbed in a ‘virtual’ struggle while disconnecting from what was real.” He wound up with an 11-year prison sentence for providing material support to a terrorist group. Nor is that kind of experience reserved for jihadis. Anyone who spends any time in the many alternative worlds that can be accessed via Twitter or Facebook can encounter similarly false information, in many forms and in many languages, every day. Just follow the right Twitter accounts, and you’ll get links to the fake websites and dubious organizations that produce invented statistics. You’ll find friends who believe in the invented statistics, too. If you so desire, you can then go on to live in a bubble entirely divorced from any reality except one created by far-right bloggers, left-wing anarchists or Kremlin spin doctors, all of whom excel at developing this kind of alternate reality.","Many of those who do the inventing have particular political goals, such as the election of Trump, or the recruitment of Islamic State volunteers. But the longer-term impact of disinformation is even more profound: It creates cynicism and apathy. Eventually it means that nobody believes anything. People aren’t bothered by Trump’s lies — or Vladimir Putin’s lies, or the Islamic State’s lies — because they don’t believe anything they read anyway. There’s so much garbage information out there, it’s impossible to know what is true.","Nobody yet knows what to do about this sea change, because few people have even accepted that it is happening or understand how it works. There’s a wide-open space for Zuckerberg to help journalists, academics, activists and politicians figure out how to bring reality back into public debate. Maybe we need to study “media literacy” in schools; maybe we need independent “accuracy indexes” to rate websites; maybe we need to work on understanding the psychology of conspiracy theorists. We don’t know yet what works, but it’s time we started trying to figure it out. And that is a $45 billion question.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","Anne ApplebaumAnne Applebaum is a Washington Post columnist, covering national politics and foreign policy, with a special focus on Europe and Russia.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it.","\"All kinds of people had access to the data,\" said Wylie, who helped develop Cambridge Analytica's methods for using the information to target and persuade voters. \"It was everywhere.\"","Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ, a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave, the official campaign backing Britain's withdrawal from the EU, Wylie said.","Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company, SCL Group, that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun-for-hire, often in countries where democratic institutions are weak. He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost.","The 28-year-old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013. He left the next year.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign. It denies any wrongdoing.","Cambridge Analytica's acting CEO, Alexander Tayler, said in a statement that Wylie was a part-time contractor who \"has no direct knowledge of our work or practices\" since he left the company.","Wylie said he \"absolutely\" believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica's databases for its work on the Brexit campaign. In the closely fought referendum in 2016, 51.9 percent of voters backed Britain's departure from the EU.","\"I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning,\" Wylie said.","He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn't want to relocate to Britain. The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a \"department,\" he said.","Because of the links between the two companies, Vote Leave got the \"the next best thing\" to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ, \"a company that can do virtually everything that (Cambridge Analytica) can do but with a different billing name,\" Wylie said.","AggregateIQ, based in Victoria, British Columbia, issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL.","\"AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates,\" the company said. \"All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client.\"","Wylie's testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign.","They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625,000 pounds ($888,000) to the pro-Brexit student group BeLeave, which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ."],"isopubdate":""}

Facebook, the company you created, now has more users (~2.1 billion) than there are people in China (~1.4 billion), the largest country in the world.","You have the ability to reach all of these users with whatever message you’d like them to see, whenever you want them to see it. You control the way billions of people get their news and information, you have immense influence over the connected world.","It’s because of your great power that I’m concerned when I see this headline:","“Facebook has gotten too big for Mark Zuckerberg”","“Mark Zuckerberg is not comfortable with the enormous influence he has over the world.” — CNN Money","Yo, Mark. Here’s the deal, you’re leading one of the largest companies in the world. You’re impacting the lives of all 2 billion Facebook users. You’ve risen to the highest ranks of power in the world, and you have a huge responsibility to use that power nobly and honestly. So far your company has failed to do so, it has repeatedly mislead people to believe that the information your company gathers is to help make the product better for them. However, after recent news it appears that Facebook is focused on making the product more profitable for itself.","Leading Facebook Users, To Where?","Your position, as CEO of Facebook, is like being the leader of a global superpower, spread over the world, spread across demographics, economic situations, and geographic locations. You are leading your followers (or Facebook friends), but where are you taking them? Right now both you and they are unsure of where the platform is headed. You’ve betrayed your friends, by allowing their data to be compromised on Facebook. What are you doing to regain their trust? Fortunately for you, users have been given so little power to this point, that they can’t switch up their use of Facebook to benefit them. This means that in order to assure their data’s privacy and security, they need to delete their accounts and completely leave your social network. Most people aren’t willing to do this, because Facebook has become something they use every day.","When there were concerns about Fake News and propaganda being spread on Facebook, you said that you were going to make Facebook more about our family and friends sharing content we’re actually interested in. Now you’re saying that you want to “give people a better idea of how their data are being used.” Unfortunately, I don’t think that’s what people want. We already know that we can read your privacy policy and see what information is being gathered and used. Regardless of what it says, users have little to no control of if the information is used. We want control. We want to know that Facebook is a platform for the user, for us, the people. Until now it hasn’t been. It’s been about profits for Facebook. While the social networking that Facebook offers is awesome, it’s completely unfair that you use all of our data in ways that make us uncomfortable. You, after all, are the one getting the last laugh.","Privacy, For Big Companies Is Possible!","Apple, a company that has consistently been big on privacy, is outspoken about the importance of privacy. Could Apple be more profitable if they opted to collect and use its users’ data for advertising and other purposes? Most certainly.","“Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly” according to Steve Jobs, in this 2010 interview.","There is great value in privacy, both for the company and the consumer. Apple hasn’t gone through this negative media frenzy that Facebook is seeing right now. They have actually seen the opposite, privacy advocates supported Apple for standing up to the FBI and refusing to crack an iPhone involved in a terrorism case.","Of course, Facebook runs on a completely different business model than Apple. It’s completely naive to assume that Facebook could exist in its current form without collecting user data, and Facebook is certainly not the only privacy villain on the internet. Facebook collects all kinds of information, but it has a very important portion of our data, that very few companies have access to: our relationships.","According to Jean-Louis Gassée, Mark Zuckerberg thinks we’re idiots. I’m not sure that the case, but the world’s relationship with the King of Social Media needs to change.","Zuck, Lead Us Into the Glorious Future, Where Facebook Keeps our Information Private","Privacy on the biggest social network in the world is not just possible, it’s essential for its survival.

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

At that juncture, Facebook already faced user concerns about how it dealt with privacy and user data.","Jobs starts by pointing out that not everyone in Silicon Valley thinks alike on privacy. Apple “always had a very different view of privacy” than many of its cohorts, he said. Jobs then laid out his strongly held views on privacy — which even went so far as risking annoying users by forcing them to answer questions about the sharing of their data:","“Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly. I’m an optimist; I believe people are smart, and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data.”","Steve Jobs: An unofficial mentor for Mark Zuckerberg","As with many young, high-profile Silicon Valley executives, Zuckerberg received unofficial mentoring from Jobs early in his career. “I had a lot of questions for him,” Zuckerberg said during an interview with Charlie Rose back in 2011. The topics included “how to build a team around you that’s focused on building as high quality and good things as you are,” he said.","Right at the start of Facebook’s existence (so far back that it was still called Thefacebook), Apple was responsible for one of the biggest cash influxes in the company’s history. To gain a foothold in colleges by offering promotions and discounts, Apple sponsored a group on the site by agreeing to pay $1 per month for every user who joined — with a monthly minimum of $50,000.","Relations between Apple and Facebook weren’t always good","Nonetheless, relations between the two companies haven’t always been so good. Zuck disagreed with Apple CEO Tim Cook’s assertion that “you’re the product” for companies that base their revenue on user data. The Facebook CEO lashed out at this concept, calling it “ridiculous.” (He also knocked Apple for pricing its products so highly.)","Jobs also supposedly referred to the Facebook founder as a “****ing a**hole” after a particularly heated spat.","Still, we totally think Zuckerberg should have learned a valuable lesson from Jobs and followed his advice.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

{"originalurl":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/facebook-data-misuse-scandal-affects-substantially-more-than-50m-claims-wylie/","title":"Facebook data misuse scandal affects “substantially” more than 50M, claims Wylie – TechCrunch","text":["Chris Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower whose revelations about Facebook data being misused for political campaigning has wiped billions off the share value of the company in recent days and led to the FTC opening a fresh investigation, has suggested the scale of the data leak is substantially larger than has been reported so far.","Giving evidence today, to a UK parliamentary select committee that’s investigating the use of disinformation in political campaigning, Wylie said: “The 50 million number is what the media has felt safest to report — because of the documentation that they can rely on — but my recollection is that it was substantially higher than that. So my own view is it was much more than 50M.”","We’ve reached out to Facebook about Wylie’s claim — but at the time of writing the company had not provided a response.","“There were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,” Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says users’ data was obtained by CA. “It first started as a very small pilot — firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral register… We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallife deployed via Facebook’s platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014.","“That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.”","The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie.","“This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.”","Facebook has previously confirmed 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it.","Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing.","Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reported that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform.","In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak.","It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes. EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that.","“There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.”","Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, Facebook settled with the FTC over charges it had deceived users by “telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public”.","And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal.","Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.","When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data.","The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data”. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it has also tweeted re: the GSR data.","(Following the session, CA has also now put out a longer response statement, refuting multiple parts of Wylie’s testimony and claiming he has “misrepresented himself and the company”. In this it also claims: “Cambridge Analytica does not hold any GSR data or any data derived from GSR data. We have never shared the GSR data with Aggregate IQ [another alleged affiliate company], Palantir or any other entity. Cambridge Analytica did not use any GSR data in the work that we did for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.”)","Asked by the committee about Nix’s earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”.","“That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data.","Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered.","Kogan also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”.","Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it sought to predict via patterns in the data.","He said:","For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC. And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like.","“That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.”","Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later.","“The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data”","Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms.","Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.”","The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions.","“That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Wylie added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.”","Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.”","The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns.","Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used.","“Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.”","In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: “The source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property.”","Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA.","“It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore.","“But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].”","The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”.","During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform.","“He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted?","“It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.”","We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either.","Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge. They certainly didn’t with me — until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no I’ve actually given over everything to the authorities.”","“I suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016… they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,” he said. “So I don’t think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach that’s going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data,” he added. “It was everywhere.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them.

Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign.

And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The noteworthy discovery one can make from the original article is, how little it takes – just a few Facebook ‘likes’ – to establish some very telling characteristics of a person. The power to look at data in such great detail and make connections with seemingly irrelevant, other points of data could be the cornerstone of behavior modification. When large amounts of data are studied over time, surely consistent patterns can be found. When there is a large enough sample of data, reliable estimations could then be made about entire societies. This is important because societies provide the general environment in which individuals live. Once the relationship between societies and individuals could be understood with a degree of sureness, behavior modification could be done at a micro and macro level. This is extremely dangerous and gives unsurpassed power to the ones in control of such technologies, be they governments, corporations, or any other institution. The only defense a person has is a sense of awareness, but that too after a period of time will turn into paranoia.","“Commercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.”","Cambridge Analytica has come out with a statement in its defense. However, shifting the discussion from behavior manipulation to finer points of legality will be a great distraction. On a legal front, there may or may not be defensible positions. That will be an altogether different debate.","Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service. We are in touch with Facebook now and can confirm that we do not hold or use any data from profiles https://t.co/YD8kFXCFTL","The more important issue, from which mankind, in general, should not take away its focus is the very practice of using information shared in innocence to modify the behavior of others.","#IfSocialMediaDisappeared I am afraid, there will still be people who will resort to manipulative practices. The flaw was always there among some of humans. Social media has given them a much larger playing field.","To look at just Cambridge Analytica or Facebook as isolated examples would be as much a tendency as it would be a mistake. Other organizations are engaged in using information with the intention of expanding their businesses.","It is important to understand the process and know the kind of people who are behind such technologies. After all, they are the ones putting the intention in the algorithms! Should we be so enthused about the technology, or be so concerned with the legality of certain practices that we overlook the underlying motivations? The way social media has become so deeply integrated into everyday living, practically speaking, it is already too late to step away from all of this without severely disrupting all of human society and even individual lives.

Verizon is one of many ISPs who operate massive advertising networks. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)","Ever since Congress voted to repeal the FCC's broadband privacy protections due to come into force later this year - which would have prevented internet service providers like AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner, Sprint and Verizon from selling personal data like web browsing history without prior consent - there's been a lot of bluster and blarney flying about.","Some, like the Cards Against Humanity creator Max Temkin, have promised to buy and publish the browsing histories of those congressmen and women who voted to abolish the privacy rules. As Russel Brandom at The Verge has already pointed out, this would most likely be straight up illegal, and those campaigns are probably doomed to failure.","What few have actually addressed is how telecoms companies actually profit from such data (and will be able to continue to do without consent, thanks to the vote). No, ISPs will not just sell massive Excel sheets of personal info to the highest bidder, nor will they flog records on named individuals, again a probable breach of the law.","ISPs = giant advertising networks","Instead, they'll continue to operate much like Facebook and Google do. They will wait for brands and ad companies to come to them and offer money for ad space on their networks, whether that's via text messages, apps or websites, wherever ISPs have presence (so, kind of everywhere in modern life...).","ISPs have been doing this for years as most aren't just providing internet services; many operate giant advertising networks. For instance, AT&T has AdWorks, while Verizon has the blandly-titled Relevant Mobile Advertising and Verizon Selects, which it melded with its AOL Advertising Network in 2015.","AT&T's graphic on how its AdWorks platform works, combining data and then targeting the ad.AT&T AdWorks","They build substantial datasets on the online activities of certain demographics, say 18 year-olds who spend four hours a day reading about One Direction. They can then tell companies who want to market to those teenagers that thanks to their dataset they know just who to target and how. ISPs take advertisers' money and place those ads where they go best, on devices and web services they know the consumer uses.","And that's what makes ISPs such attractive ad networks: the incredibly detailed information they have on consumers, even when compared to Silicon Valley heavyweights. \"It's very similar to Facebook, except the ISPs have a better understanding of who's using what device in the home,\" noted Matt Hogan, CEO at DataCoup, a New York company trying to help consumers sell their data directly and openly. \"They also have a potentially more granular look at mobile behavior including across the board app usage and mobile browsing.\"","The fact that the rules won't come into force simply means the ISPs won't have to fear any future FCC restrictions of their sprawling ad networks.","Data leak anxiety","This might sound innocuous compared to much-feared but highly-unlikely sales of personal data to anyone and everyone, but there are many who see this as a pernicious and invasive kind of marketing, not to mention that such datasets can and do leak. \"It's likely that these datasets find their way into the ad-tech ecosystem, where the morals are a bit looser,\" noted Hogan.","\"In ad-tech, there are so many players, so little oversight, so many leakage points, so much collation and file mapping. This is where I see immediate consumer risk. It's hard to know if the ISPs plan to play in that sandbox, but I imagine it's hard to operate in the ad network business without some incorporation of the ad-tech ecosystem.\"","End on a good note...","While there's been some righteous anger swelling from this week's vote, there are some reasons to remain positive. For one, services like VPNs, Tor and HTTPS encrypted websites will prevent ISPs from grabbing granular data on customers.","Second, Hogan thinks that the streamlining of regulation of ISPs under FTC jurisdiction, rather than FCC, will spur on a self-regulating market where privacy will be a selling point. Hogan, a former Lehman Brothers and Deutsche Bank salesman, believes the FTC, as a traditionally more reserved enforcer, will let the market \"dictate the direction of innovation.\" It's a similar line of thinking to the FCC chairman Ajit Pai, who said yesterday the FTC was a more capable regulator of internet privacy.","In Hogan's ideal world, those ISPs who are privacy-focused, like those who actually spoke out against the vote, will be considerably more attractive than the monolithic entities who spend a lot of money trying to convince lawmakers to do their bidding. \"With this new regulatory regime, I think privacy will be a differentiating factor,\" he said.","\"Perhaps the best tools the consumer has is their voice and their wallet,\" Hogan added. \"If they don't like what the ISPs could potentially do with their data then they can yell and scream about it - both to the ISP's and their congressman. More potent, if they don't like what a contracting service is doing, go down to the street and subscribe to the contracting service that is taking their privacy more seriously.\"","I cover security and privacy for Forbes.

We do use Facebook as a platform to advertise, as do all brands and most agencies, or all agencies, I should say. We use Facebook as a means to gather data. We roll out surveys on Facebook that the public can engage with if they elect to.”","That line is one of the claims the committee says it’s keen to press him on now. In a letter to Nix, it writes: “[T]here are a number of inconsistencies in your evidence to us of 27 February, notably your denial that your company received data from the Global Science Research company [aka the firm behind the survey app used by CA to harvest data on 50M Facebook users, according to The Observer].”","“We are also interested in asking you again about your claim that you “do not work with Facebook data, and […] do not have Facebook data,” it continues, warning: “Giving false statements to a Select Committee is a very serious matter.”","The self-styled ‘not a political consultancy’ but “technology-driven marketing firm” (and sometime “campaign consultancy and communication services” company) — which Nix also described in his last evidence session as “not a data miner… a data analytics company” — had its Facebook account suspended late last week for violating Facebook’s platform policies.","While Nix was suspended as CEO by CA’s board on Tuesday, following a Channel 4 News report aired a series of secret recordings that appeared to show Nix advocating the use of proxy organisations to feed untraceable messages onto social media to influence voters. The recordings were made by an undercover reporter posing as a potential client.","The UK’s data protection watchdog, the ICO, has also applied for a warrant to gain access to CA’s offices and servers — accusing the company of failing to hand over information the regulator had requested as part of a wider investigation it’s carrying out into the use of data analytics for political purposes.","We reached out to the company for comment on the DCMS recall. At the time of writing it had not responded.","Below are a few choice segments from Nix’s last evidence session in from of the committee — which we expect he will be asked to revisit should he agree to make a repeat appearance…","The committee has also asked Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence in person — albeit, don’t bet the farm on that coming to pass. CA ‘data whistleblower’ Chris Wylie has agreed to testify and is due to given evidence on March 27.","Q698 Rebecca Pow:… Could you expand a bit more on what those surveys are, what you are asking people and how you are gathering the data? Do you keep that data on surveys carried out on Facebook or does Facebook keep it?","Alexander Nix: I cannot speak to Facebook, but as far as I am aware the process works a bit like an opinion survey. If I want to find out how many people prefer red cars or yellow cars, I can post that question on Facebook and people can agree. They can opt in to answer a survey and they give their consent and they say, “I prefer a yellow car” and then we can collect that data. That is no different to running a telephone poll or a digital poll or a mail poll or any other form of poll. It is just a platform that allows you to engage with communities.","Q699 Rebecca Pow: Are they a big part of your data-gathering service?","Alexander Nix: When we work for brands, whether it is in the UK or in the US or elsewhere, we often feel the need to probe their customers and find out what they think about particular products or services. We might use Facebook as a means to engage with the general public to gather this data.","Q700 Simon Hart: Let me ask a very quick question on the Facebook survey opt-in option that you were describing. If you are asking somebody what kind of car they prefer and they opt in, does that facilitate access to other data that may be held by Facebook, which is irrelevant to car colour, or is it only the data you collect on car colour that is relevant?Nothing else that is part of the data held by Facebook would be available to you.","Alexander Nix: You are absolutely right—no other data. As far as I am aware, Facebook does not share any of its data. It is what is known as a walled garden, which keep its data—","Q701 Simon Hart: People are not in any way accidently giving you consent to access data other than that that you specifically asked for.","Alexander Nix: That is correct. People are not giving us consent and Facebook does not have a mechanism that allows third parties such as us to access its data on its customers.","Q702 Simon Hart: Even with its customers’ consent.","Alexander Nix: Even with its customers’ consent.","Chair: You said in your letter to me that, “Cambridge Analytica does not gather” data from Facebook.","Alexander Nix: From Facebook?","Chair: Yes.","Alexander Nix: That is correct.","*","Q718 Chair: The actual quote from the letter is: “On 8 February 2018 Mr Matheson implied that Cambridge Analytica ‘gathers data from users on Facebook.’ Cambridge Analytica does not gather such data.” But from what you said you do, do you not, through the surveys?","Alexander Nix: Yes, I think I can see what has happened here. What we were trying to say in our letter is that we do not gather Facebook data from Facebook users. We can use Facebook as an instrument to go out and run large-scale surveys of the users, but we do not gather Facebook data.","Q719 Chair: By that do you mean that you do not have access to data that is owned by Facebook?","Alexander Nix: Exactly.","Q720 Chair: You acquire data from Facebook users through them engaging with surveys and other things.","Alexander Nix: Exactly right.","Q721 Chair: Is your engagement, either directly or through any associate companies you may have, just through the placing of surveys or are there other tools or games or thingsthat are on Facebook that you use to gather data from Facebook users?","Alexander Nix: No, simply through surveys.","*","Q729 Chair: In that presentation I think there is a slide on data analytics where you describe that data is sourced from multiple sources and any marketing company will know that there are companies that specialise in data analytics to analyse consumer behaviour. I think on your chart you had logos of different companies. I think Experian was one and Nielsen was one. You had Facebook on there as well.

It also denied that the Facebook data was used by the Trump campaign and says it didn’t work on the Brexit referendum.","The company insisted Wylie was a contractor, not a founder.","For Facebook, the controversy appears to be taking a toll. On Monday, Facebook shares fell US$12.53 or 6.77 per cent to US$172.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.","Facebook has denied the data collection was a breach because people knowingly provided their information. The company has said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his test via his Facebook app.","Facebook has also said it would ban Cambridge Analytica, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded Kogan’s app. Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn’t disclosed it until now.","On Monday, Facebook said it hired a digital forensics firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine if the Facebook data the company collected still exists or if it’s been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica agreed to give the auditor complete access to its servers and systems, Facebook said.","The social-media giant said it’s also asked Wylie and Kogan to submit to an audit as well. It said Kogan has given his verbal agreement to do so and Wylie has declined.","The Facebook data breach exposed by Wylie in recent days has caused a commotion on both sides of the Atlantic and has caught the attention of Canada’s privacy watchdog.","“Recent media reports regarding the use of personal information posted on Facebook for political purposes raise serious privacy concerns,” Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien said in the statement.","“Our office will be reaching out to Facebook to seek information regarding whether Canadians’ personal information was affected by the issues raised in those reports. That will help us determine possible next steps.”","Therrien also said his office has offered to assist an investigation into the matter already launched by the U.K. information commissioner’s office. He said his ultimate goal is to ensure that the privacy rights of Canadian Facebook users are protected.","Asked Monday about the possible Facebook breach, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the government will take every step to protect the integrity of the Canadian democratic system.","“When an issue like that emerges, we all need to take it very, very seriously, make sure we get the facts and respond accordingly,” Goodale said in Ottawa.","“This is a rapidly moving, rapidly evolving situation because of technology. What we know or think we know today is likely to be radically different six months from now. And we have to be alert to every twist and turn along the way.”","The data leak may prompt a stronger push from Canadians for stronger privacy protection legislation, according to cyber security expert Dominic Vogel.","“I think from a policy perspective, what we’re going to start seeing is even strong teeth from regulatory a perspective around privacy policies and data usage,” he said. “This is really going to star upping up the ante of privacy regulation and people being in greater control of their data.”","However, users also need to understand any information they give out online could be sold or used, and sometimes the data collection comes in seemingly innocuous forms.","“We see all these fun quizzes, what friends character or ice cream flavour are you,” he says. “People really need to pause and understand that 99.9 per cent of those quizzes are garbage,. They’re meant to troll your data.”","On Monday, Wylie told NBC’s “Today” in an interview that Cambridge Analytica used data to create profiling algorithms that enabled the company to “explore mental vulnerabilities of people.” It enabled the firm to inject information into different forms of online content, so that people saw things that may not have been true, he said.","“This is a company that really took fake news to the next level,” Wylie said.","He also said he had left Cambridge Analytica before it joined the Trump campaign. But he added he knew the company met with Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in 2015, before Trump had announced his candidacy."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Anyone who got in during the dog days after the IPO could have could have made 10 times their original investment!","(Missing that early price is one of my biggest regrets as an investor.)","But if you saw in the news what billionaire investor George Soros just said about social media giants, you may very well be looking for the next Facebook at this point — one with all the growth potential Facebook had in its early days.","And we may have found just such an obscure stock… more on that in a moment. (And its CEO is making a $429 million bet on the stock!)","But first, let’s talk about Soros. He just told everyone at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that Facebook’s and other social media giants \"days are numbered.\" He says the company’s near-stranglehold on social media will soon be attacked by regulators… and that its growth will stop in less than three years because it will \"run out of people to convert.”","Given Soros’ reputation as one of the world’s top hedge fund managers, he really has me thinking about what to do with my own Facebook shares. The company is an absolute powerhouse in the ever-growing advertising space, but if Soros is right and its own growth stops… yikes.","Luckily two great growth investors are agreeing on a possible “new Facebook.\"","First, renowned investor Tom Gardner has identified a stock that he thinks resembles Facebook in its early days.","And it’s growing at a torrid pace – profit grew 42% over the prior year quarter alone!","But there’s something even more unique about Tom’s latest buy signal that has the investing community bustling.","Tom’s brother David – a legendary investor who picked Amazon at $3.19! – has gone on record also recommending investors buy this same exact stock.","Some investors have come to call this signal a “total conviction” buy sign – and it’s an incredibly rare occurrence. Over 17 years of guiding investors, Tom and David have only ever formally agreed on recommending 21 stocks.","And when they have, the results have been spectacular:","Netflix, which Tom agreed with David on in June of 2007, is a “Total Conviction” pick up 11,716%.","Tesla, which Tom agreed with David on in November of 2012, is up 843%.","In fact, across the 21 stocks Tom and David Gardner have agreed on ... the average return for each stock is an astounding 509% … crushing the S&P 500 by almost 6x!","But here’s the real kicker about this “Total Conviction” buy…","This tiny little internet company is 209 times smaller than the size of Facebook.","Yet, the Gardners think it has a jaw-dropping market opportunity that could be bigger than 2016 total sales of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google – combined!","This small cap stock has already banked $429 million for its young CEO.","And this obscure company has been raking in cash from deals with industry titans … with almost no fanfare from Wall Street.","And every good investor knows the big money is made by finding little-known companies with big growth prospects – and getting in early.","So if Soros is right, and Facebook’s day are indeed numbered… then perhaps this small company that Tom says resembles an early Facebook will fit the bill.","The Motley Fool has recommended this stock four times already in the past year, and each time it’s gone on to crush the market.","But we think that’s just the beginning.","At such a small size we’re confident this stock has PLENTY of room to go.","However please note – unfortunately as of now, you risk missing out on this “Total Conviction” stock – because Tom will only reveal this stock recommendation to members of the Stock Advisor community.","But while you can't go back in time to lock in the 509% returns you'd have by purchasing all of the stocks David and Tom have agreed on ...

{"originalurl":"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/21/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerbergs-statements-on-privacy-2003-2018.html","title":"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's statements on privacy, 2003-2018","text":["Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is testifying before Congress this week to discuss the company's data privacy practices, as well as issues like fake news and Russian tampering in the 2016 presidential elections.","According to a transcript of his prepared testimony, he will admit that Facebook has made mistakes on these issues, including privacy: \"It's not enough to give people control of their information, we have to make sure developers they've given it to are protecting it too.\" He will also talk specifically about the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where a developer created a Facebook quiz that it used to build detailed user profiles, which were later passed to the political data analytics firm against Facebook's policies.","But this is not a new issue. Zuckerberg has been thinking and talking about privacy ever since he built the predecessor to Facebook, called Facemash, at Harvard back in 2003. When users of the service complained that their pictures were being used without permission, Zuckerberg took the site down and apologized.","Since then, a fairly consistent pattern has emerged. Zuckerberg and other Facebook employees rarely talk about \"privacy,\" but rather operate from the assumption that people want to share information, as long as they can control how it's used. And as was the case with Facemash, sometimes the company goes too far -- in which case Zuckerberg apologizes, Facebook makes changes, and life goes on.","Here's a comprehensive look at what Zuckerberg has said about privacy and controlling data, according to CNBC research and Michael Zimmer's \"Zuckerberg files.\"","'Issues about violating people's privacy don't seem to be surmountable'","Harvard's student newspaper interviewed Zuckerberg in 2003 about his pre-Facebook project, facemash.com, which asked students to rate the attractiveness of their classmates. Pictures were scraped from housing websites and uploaded.","The website quickly caused outrage and was permanently taken down. A then-19-year-old Zuckerberg said:","\"I don't see how it can go back online. Issues about violating people's privacy don't seem to be surmountable. The primary concern is hurting people's feelings. I'm not willing to risk insulting anyone.\"","In an apology letter, he wrote, \"I hope you understand, this is not how I meant for things to go, and I apologize for any harm done as a result of my neglect to consider how quickly the site would spread and its consequences thereafter...I definitely see how my intentions could be seen in the wrong light.\"","'There are pretty intensive privacy options'","Zuckerberg built the first version of Facebook from the ashes of Facemash. In 2004, with just hundreds signed on, Zuckerberg made sure to clarify that the extensive search capabilities were countered by privacy options for members who didn't want everyone to be able to look up their information.","\"You can limit who can see your information, if you only want current students to see your information, or people in your year, in your house, in your classes. You can limit a search so that only a friend or a friend of a friend can look you up. People have very good control over who can see their information.\"","'We're not forcing anyone to publicize any information about themselves'","Early Facebook investor Jim Breyer interviewed Mark Zuckerberg in 2005, during which Zuckerberg responded to an audience question about his approach to the ethical and legal implications of monetizing Facebook.","\"But in terms of the ethical implications of creating this? I mean what I kind of saw this as is enabling out for your flow of information.... We're not asking anyone to put anything out there that they wouldn't be comfortable putting out. We're not forcing anyone to publicize any information about themselves. We give people pretty good control over their privacy. I mean you can make it so that no one can see anything, or no one can see your profile unless they're your friend. And I think that we encourage people to use that stuff. We point people to it.\"","You can watch the full presentation here. Zuckerberg's comments on ethics start around 41:20:","'We're obviously really sensitive to people's privacy'","Zuckerberg delivered a guest lecture moderated Professor Michael D. Smith at Harvard in 2005, where he talked about Facebook's expansion from Harvard to other schools. The idea of privacy and data usage came up:","\"We have a lot of stuff that we put in place to make sure that people don't aggregate information off of Facebook. Obviously, you can't see profiles of people at other schools. But also, if you try to view a lot of profiles, it picks up that you're just viewing an abnormal number of profiles. By analyzing user activity, we've built Bayesian filters that let us pick out abnormal activity really quickly and just show very limited information to those users .... We're obviously really sensitive to people's privacy.\"","'We simply did a bad job'","In 2007, Facebook faced its first big privacy flap after it had expanded beyond universities to the general population. The company introduced Beacon, which allowed third-party sites to publish user purchases unless users opted out. That meant that some users unwittingly broadcast to their friends information like their movie purchases from Blockbuster or plane ticket purchases from Travelocity.","Zuckerberg addressed it in a Facebook blog post that has since been archived:","\"We've made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we've made even more with how we've handled them. We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it. . . . Instead of acting quickly, we took too long to decide on the right solution. I'm not proud of the way we've handled this situation and I know we can do better....","We were excited about Beacon because we believe a lot of information people want to share isn't on Facebook, and if we found the right balance, Beacon would give people an easy and controlled way to share more of that information with their friends.","But we missed the right balance. At first we tried to make it very lightweight so people wouldn't have to touch it for it to work. The problem with our initial approach of making it an opt-out system instead of opt-in was that if someone forgot to decline to share something, Beacon still went ahead and shared it with their friends.\"","Zuckerberg's Law","\"I would expect that next year, people will share twice as much information as they share this year, and next year, they will be sharing twice as much as they did the year before,\" he said. \"That means that people are using Facebook, and the applications and the ecosystem, more and more.\"","His remarks were later dubbed \"Zuckerberg's Law.\"","'We're just going to keep on moving more and more' toward openness","Zuckerberg spoke to Wired in 2009 about the creation of public profiles:","\"Just a couple of weeks ago we announced this open privacy setting where prior to that it was impossible for someone to take their profile and say that they wanted it to be open. Now they can do that. They can say it's open to everyone. And what I would just expect is that as time goes on, we're just going to keep on moving more and more in that direction....Just from the launches that we've had, it's pretty clear that we haven't mastered the art of moving people along in terms of change, making these changes; but I think we're getting better at it.\"","The 'social norm' of privacy has evolved over time","Zuckerberg responded to a question about \"pushing the envelope\" on privacy during an award speech in 2010:","\"It's interesting looking back, right? When we got started — just a night in my dorm room at Harvard — the question a lot of people asked is, 'Why would I want any information on the internet at all? Like, why would I want to have a website?' And then, in the last five or six years, blogging has taken off in a huge way, and all these different services that have people sharing more information. And people have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information — and different kinds — but more openly with more people. And that social norm is just something that's evolved over time. And we view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and updating what our system is, to reflect what the current social norms are. A lot of companies would be trapped by the conventions, and their legacy of the systems that they've built. Doing a privacy change for 350 million users is really it's not about the type of thing that a lot of companies would do. But I think we view that is a really important thing to always kind of keep a beginner's mind and think, 'What would we do if we were starting about the company now, and the site now? ' We decided that these would be the social norms now and we just went for it.\"","'What people want isn't complete privacy .... they want control'","\"The way that people think about privacy is changing a bit ... What people want isn't complete privacy. It isn't that they want secrecy. It's that they want control over what they share and what they don't.\"","'Some people don't understand how their personal information is used'","Zuckerberg wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2010, in which he outlined Facebook's principles for privacy:","\"We have also heard that some people don't understand how their personal information is used and worry that it is shared in ways they don't want. I'd like to clear that up now. Many people choose to make some of their information visible to everyone so people they know can find them on Facebook. We already offer controls to limit the visibility of that information and we intend to make them even stronger.","Here are the principles under which Facebook operates:","— You have control over how your information is shared.","— We do not share your personal information with people or services you don't want.","— We do not give advertisers access to your personal information.","— We do not and never will sell any of your information to anyone.","— We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone.\"","'Applications have to ask for permission'","\"There's this false rumor that's been going around which says that we're sharing private information with applications and it's just not true. The way it works, is ... if you choose to share some information with everyone on the site, that means that any person can go look up that information and any application can go look up that information as well. ... But applications have to ask for permission for anything that you've set to be private.\"","'There have been misperceptions that we're trying to make all information open, but that's false'","He discussed the \"serendipitous connections\" that Facebook enables in on stage in 2010:","\"Privacy is very important to us. I think there are some misperceptions. People use Facebook to share and to stay connected. You don't start off on Facebook being connected to your friends, you've got to be able to find them. So having some information available broadly is good for that. Now, there have been misperceptions that we're trying to make all information open, but that's false. We encourage people to keep their most private information private. But some of the most basic information, we suggest that people leave public.","\"We recommend settings for people, and we asked that everyone review their settings and make a choice about what they wanted them to be. We didn't simply change them….The big feedback that we got was that the privacy settings had become too complex. Over the years we'd just accumulated many, many settings.","\"More than 50 percent of Facebook users have changed their privacy settings at one point. That demonstrates that our users understand the tools, he says. 'To me, that's a signal that on the whole, we're getting it right and giving people the control they want.'","'We realize that people will probably criticize us for this for a long time'","\"If I could choose to share my mobile-phone number only with everyone on Facebook, I wouldn't do it. But because I can do it with only my friends I do it.","A lot of people who are worried about privacy and those kinds of issues will take any minor misstep that we make and turn it into as big a deal as possible,\" he said. \"We realize that people will probably criticize us for this for a long time, but we just believe that this is the right thing to do.\"","'Everyone needs complete control over who they share with at all times'","Zuckerberg shared a Facebook note to his personal page in 2011 after the FTC signed a consent decree governing Facebook's use of personal data. He said:","\"I founded Facebook on the idea that people want to share and connect with people in their lives, but to do this everyone needs complete control over who they share with at all times....","This idea has been the core of Facebook since day one. When I built the first version of Facebook, almost nobody I knew wanted a public page on the internet. That seemed scary. But as long as they could make their page private, they felt safe sharing with their friends online. Control was key. With Facebook, for the first time, people had the tools they needed to do this. That's how Facebook became the world's biggest community online. We made it easy for people to feel comfortable sharing things about their real lives....","I'm the first to admit that we've made a bunch of mistakes. In particular, I think that a small number of high profile mistakes, like Beacon four years ago and poor execution as we transitioned our privacy model two years ago, have often overshadowed much of the good work we've done... not one day goes by when I don't think about what it means for us to be the stewards of this community and their trust.\"","On the decree and the hiring of chief privacy officers, Zuckerberg said:","\"[T]his means we're making a clear and formal long-term commitment to do the things we've always tried to do and planned to keep doing -- giving you tools to control who can see your information and then making sure only those people you intend can see it .... As a matter of fact, privacy is so deeply embedded in all of the development we do that every day tens of thousands of servers worth of computational resources are consumed checking to make sure that on any webpage we serve, that you have access to see each of the sometimes hundreds or even thousands of individual pieces of information that come together to form a Facebook page....","We do privacy access checks literally tens of billions of times each day to ensure we're enforcing that only the people you want see your content. These privacy principles are written very deeply into our code. .... We will continue to improve the service, build new ways for you to share and offer new ways to protect you and your information better than any other company in the world.\"","'Giving people control over what they share is a fundamental principle'","\"[W]e hope to rewire the way people spread and consume information. We think the world's information infrastructure should resemble the social graph — a network built from the bottom up or peer-to-peer, rather than the monolithic, top-down structure that has existed to date. We also believe that giving people control over what they share is a fundamental principle of this rewiring.\"","In response to reports about the PRISM surveillance program and other revelations from activist Edward Snowden:","\"When governments ask Facebook for data, we review each request carefully to make sure they always follow the correct processes and all applicable laws, and then only provide the information if it is required by law. We will continue fighting aggressively to keep your information safe and secure.","We strongly encourage all governments to be much more transparent about all programs aimed at keeping the public safe. It's the only way to protect everyone's civil liberties and create the safe and free society we all want over the long term.\"","'We go out of our way to help fix issues'","In early March 2014, reports surfaced that the National Security Agency posed as Facebook in controversial surveillance program. Zuckerberg responded to the allegations by telling users that he was \"so confused\" and frustrated that the U.S. government might have undermined his security engineers.","\"To keep the internet strong, we need to keep it secure. That's why at Facebook we spend a lot of our energy making our services and the whole internet safer and more secure. We encrypt communications, we use secure protocols for traffic, we encourage people to use multiple factors for authentication and we go out of our way to help fix issues we find in other people's services....","Unfortunately, it seems like it will take a very long time for true full reform. So it's up to us -- all of us -- to build the internet we want. Together, we can build a space that is greater and a more important part of the world than anything we have today, but is also safe and secure. I'm committed to seeing this happen, and you can count on Facebook to do our part.\"","'The kind of privacy that no one had ever seen before'","Earnings conference call (July 2014)","Zuckerberg spoke about privacy on the company's earnings call in July 2014:","\"I think something that's misunderstood about Facebook. One of the things that we focused on the most is creating private spaces for people to share things and have interactions that they couldn't have had elsewhere. So, if you go back to the very beginning of Facebook, rewind 10 years, I mean there were blogs and things where you could be completely public and there were e-mails, right? So, you could circulate something completely privately. But there was no space where you could share with just your friends, right? I mean it wasn't a completely private experience, but it's not completely public and it's 100 or 150 of the people that you care about.","And creating that space which was a space that had the kind of privacy that no one had ever seen before was what enabled and continues to enable the kind of interactions and the content that people feel comfortable sharing in this network that don't exist in other places in the world.","So, we're constantly looking for new opportunities to create new dynamics like that and open up new different private spaces for people where they can then feel comfortable sharing and having the freedom to express things that you otherwise wouldn't be able to.\"","'Facebook stands with many technology companies to protect you and your information.'","Reposting a comment from subsidiary WhatsApp, Zuckerberg said: \"Facebook stands with many technology companies to protect you and your information.\"","The original post, written by WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum, said:","\"The purpose of security is to safeguard privacy. Billions of people share their most personal, intimate information using services like ours, and they expect all of us to keep it safe from criminals and other bad guys. Asking a single company to undermine the security of its product for an investigation threatens the security of all of us in the long run.","Today, WhatsApp and other companies are asking a U.S. court to overturn an order that would require Apple to weaken the security of its product. We are proud to stand together to demonstrate how these efforts go beyond what the law allows and how they compromise the values upon which our country is built.\"","'Keeping our community safe does not require compromising privacy'","\"As we discuss keeping our community safe, it is important to emphasize that part of keeping people safe is protecting individual security and liberty. We are strong advocates of encryption and have built it into the largest messaging platforms in the world — WhatsApp and Messenger. Keeping our community safe does not require compromising privacy. Since building end-to-end encryption into WhatsApp, we have reduced spam and malicious content by more than 75%.The path forward is to recognize that a global community needs social infrastructure to keep us safe from threats around the world, and that our community is uniquely positioned to prevent disasters, help during crises, and rebuild afterwards. Keeping the global community safe is an important part of our mission — and an important part of how we'll measure our progress going forward.\"","'We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you'"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}
{"originalurl":"http://www.maeeshat.in/2018/03/the-corrective-measures-required-post-facebook-data-breach/","title":"The corrective measures required post-Facebook data breach - Maeeshat","text":["The corrective measures required post-Facebook data breach","The Facebook data breach raises urgent questions that need to be answered responsibly by our industry — given its terrifying scale and impact. In today’s world, data is a form of soft power, and it is essential for those who wield it, to use it responsibly so that consumer confidence isn’t compromised.","The challenge is that, at an idea-generation stage, it can be difficult to draw a clear, bright line between whether data is being used for optimisation or for manipulation.","Take, for instance, the Obama and Trump campaigns in the US. The former used the same digital platforms for optimising communication and ensuring voter confidence and dissemination of information. On the other hand, British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used the same platforms but with malafide intent — to manipulate the views and preferences of voters.","As investigations continue, it is increasingly clear that data was stolen, models used were unauthorised for the purpose they were being used, the messages (in many cases) were outright lies.","So the whole operation was questionable from the get-go. It is, therefore, extremely critical to demarcate this difference — are the final consumers of a data-driven model being actively manipulated or is data being used to merely optimise a communications strategy?","It is also essential to clearly define the parties involved in the data “lifecycle” and their roles and responsibilities, with regard to how data is being used. There are usually three parties in this lifecycle, each requiring a different kind of oversight and norms.","First are the data originators, those that capture and store the data. And I’m not only talking about Facebook and Google, but also a wide range of other originators — for e.g. Equifax (which holds extremely sensitive consumer credit information), banks (which store individual-centric financial information), telecom organisations (which hold a treasure trove of communications and browsing information), etc.","Two safeguards are critical here.","One, data security safeguards to ensure the privacy (external parties shouldn’t be able to see it) and integrity (external parties shouldn’t be able to change it) of the data. This can be improved by ring-fencing the data sources and ensuring advanced security measures.","And two, ensuring explicit consumer consent for sharing and using this data. This can be done by introducing easy-to-understand verbiage around fair-use — where their data could be used and for what purposes.","These two interventions — data security and informing users where data could be shared — are the key and will go a long way in winning back consumer trust in these platforms.","The second type of entity involved is the data processing companies which employ intelligent algorithms over the data to extract insights. This includes companies like Cambridge Analytica.","Given that data processing companies also have access to a large scale of data, entrusted by clients, it is imperative that their systems are subject to similar levels of security, compliance and governance norms.","This can be resolved through globally-agreed standards of security, enforced through regular third-party audits. We need to be held to the same standards as the data sources themselves when it comes to security of the data so that we aren’t the weak link in the event of a data leak.","There may also be value in exploring how we can expressly declare the nature of algorithms employed and the source of these algorithms (in cases where there is a patent to one), to an unaffiliated third-party regulator. This will ensure better transparency around what the data is being used for.","Finally, we have the third party in the data lifecycle: The buyers of the data — organisations that pay for the data and algorithm-driven insights around it. In this case, they are the political organisations that are beneficiaries of the analysis work by the processing companies.","Here, let’s go back to my earlier point of drawing the line between what is optimisation and manipulation.","Are the data buying organisations sponsoring an ad because they feel consumers genuinely stand to benefit from the content, or are they using the data to manipulate users into actions that are not in their best interest?","More importantly, does the ad-sponsoring organisation have the authority to display that ad, or are they a geo-political adversary? This can be cleared up by implementing fair-usage policies around what the extracted data is being used for, who is using it, and what are the implications of that data — all of which needs to be made more transparent and subject to governance norms in certain cases.","Obviously, the three parties interplay with each other. For instance, Facebook and Google are two of these parties — the source and the processor. Thus, it needs to be ensured that they be accountable to both sets of norms.","It is imperative that all parties in the data lifecycle take seriously the trust with which data is being shared with them by their users — for their own good.

It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.","We have updated the story accordingly.","Original story:","Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief information security officer, will shift roles at the company. His transition will come in the wake of disagreements with other Facebook executives like COO Sheryl Sandberg about how to investigate and disclose Russian activity on the platform, The New York Times reports, citing employees of the social network. Stamos advocated for greater disclosure. Prior to his hiring at Facebook in 2015, Stamos was Chief Information Security Officer at Yahoo.","Personnel on Stamos' security team—which previously numbered 120 but is now down to three—are being gradually transferred to the product and infrastructure divisions within Facebook, under his supervision. The NYT report suggests that this has been part of his responsibilities since December, when his normal day-to-day responsibilities as CSO were reassigned. He was asked by Facebook to stay through August for optics.","Stamos is currently working in a new role in the company. \"I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security,\" he tweeted. He has not commented on any future plans to depart the organization entirely—a tweet clarifying his role after The New York Times report did not dispute the report's claim that he is leaving Facebook in August.","This news broke shortly after Facebook came under intense scrutiny over the inappropriate acquisition of its user data by Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm involved in elections in both the US and the UK. Stamos took to Twitter to defend the company—in particular, he sought to clarify that this was not a \"data breach.\" He also said in a tweet that has since been deleted:","It should be noted that several other prominent platforms, like Android and iOS, allow access to friend (contact) data with user permission. Like us, those platforms have policies about the use of data, but misusing contacts gathered knowingly from a phone is also not a \"breach\".","Stamos later deleted those tweets, saying he \"should have done a better job weighing in.\" Echoing some of the concerns that reportedly led to his departure from the role, he later tweeted:","There are a lot of big problems that the big tech companies need to be better at fixing. We have collectively been too optimistic about what we build and our impact on the world. Believe it or not, a lot of the people at these companies, from the interns to the CEOs, agree."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The most disruptive part of the proposed regulation, according to tech industry insiders and analysts, is the requirement that companies obtain consent for any data they keep on their users. Old data will not be exempted or \"grandfathered in\" under the new law.","As it currently stands, that means companies will have to re-obtain consent from all their existing users for all the data they are currently storing on them, no matter how old, according to several analysts and policy experts.","In theory, the law will ban Facebook from using the data it already has, unless the company can persuade you to re-register your permission for all the info you have already given the company. The two largest companies affected by the law will be Facebook and Google.","But Facebook, perhaps, has the bigger hurdle to overcome in order to comply. It not only uses your data as part of your personal Facebook account, it also supplies that data to advertisers through its Audience Network and Custom Audiences products, which generate ads on other websites and apps outside Facebook. The new ePrivacy law will force Facebook to ask all its European users to give permission for each separate type of data being stored or shared by Facebook.","Goldman Sachs: 'Existing data will risk becoming obsolete'","\"Organizations will have to re-obtain user consent (for the data they wish to keep) and build a fully documented permission trail before GDPR becomes enforceable - or existing data will risk becoming obsolete. There is a risk of further customer data loss once users have the right to opt out of marketing campaigns and erase their personal data as mentioned above,\" according to a note sent by Goldman Sachs analyst Lisa Yang and her team.","\"Facebook and Google will either be (a) prohibited from using the unprecedented amounts of data already in their control; or (b) subject to fines and penalties that will, for the first time in history, have a significant impact on their bottom lines,\" according to a white paper prepared for the trade organization Digital Content Next, which represents tech companies.","The EU is not kidding about those fines, either. The maximum penalty for breaking the law is 4% of total global annual revenues, which in Facebook and Google's cases would be about $1.6 billion (£1.1 billion) and $4.4 billion (£3.1 billion), respectively.","\"We note that Facebook was recently fined €1.2 mn by Spain's data protection agency for violating the country's privacy rules, with the regulator noting that \"Facebook's privacy policy contains generic and unclear terms,\" and that \"The agency considers that Facebook does not adequately collect the consent of either its users or nonusers, which constitutes a serious infringement\". This followed a similar ruling from the French data regulator which fined Facebook €150,000 for collecting and compiling user data without a legal basis and explicit consent.\"","'Much of the EU data subject data on which Facebook and Google currently sit could lose its value'","The new requirement is as dramatic as it sounds, according to the DCN paper. Facebook's entire existing European user graph is under threat:","\"Under the proposed ePrivacy Regulation, much of the EU data subject data on which Facebook and Google currently sit could lose its value because it could not be used for online behavioral or targeted advertising purposes, without dramatic changes to their current practices.\"","Similarly, at a Citi Research event held in late December, Yves Schwarzbart, the head of policy at the InternetAdvertising Bureau UK, was asked, \"Does that mean that you would have to restart building a user graph from scratch?\"","He replied, \"To some extent potentially, yeah.\"","The new regulation will affect any tech company from any country that does business in Europe. It is still being debated by the European Commission, so it may be changed or softened before launch.","Goldman's Yang believes both Facebook and Google are relatively well placed to handle the changes because they have \"direct\" relationships with people. Their users are so dependent on both their platforms, they are likely to hand over consent rather than be locked out of their email, Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp. But even so, the fear is that when each European users is forced to review and consent to every single data-type they hand over the Facebook, they may reduce their total permissions, thus lowering engagement overall.","Sheryl Sandberg: 'We also know that there may be a DAU impact for implications on European usage'","Facebook is already preparing for the new laws.","COO Sheryl Sandberg said on her last earnings call that Facebook might take a hit: \"We're going to continue to give people a personalized experience to be clear about how are using the data and give choices, and we realize that this means that some users might opt out of our ads targeting tool.

How to avoid becoming a propaganda tool?","Everything that an\nimportant person does, matters... And often it matters most in the way and\ndirection that this person did not intend...","Ernst Labruyère – 2016","It is a\nquite anachronistic picture: a man – with the carved out smile and the somewhat\nuntrained and slightly too elastic tread of the successful manager, leading by\nexample – is running on Tiananmen Square. The peculiar event takes place, right\nbefore the wall of the Forbidden City at the Gate of the Heavenly Peace in\nBeijing, under the watchful eye of Mao Zedong, the Great Helmsman of China...","The protagonist of the picture is followed by an odd-looking flock of subordinates\n(and probably bodyguards), who carefully beware of passing their boss during his running\npractice. “He is the boss and we don’t want to be fired”, is what they seem to\nthink during their cautious tread, following in his footsteps.","One can immediately distinguish the protagonist from a professional\nrunner, as everything that the latter one does is meant to save energy for later,\nin the last few hundred meters before the finish of his marathon or\ncross-country run. This man, however, is here with a goal. He is the man in\ncharge; so much is clear...","His spotless, dark-grey (anthracite-ish) T-shirt reveals that\nthis is Mark Zuckerberg: the man that blessed (or punished) the world with\nhis Facebook application and became the youngest self-made billionaire in human\nhistory.","According to Algemeen Dagblad, the Dutch newspaper that printed this\npicture, Zuckerberg is involved with his project “A year of running”. And his\nsubordinates? They follow him for as long as the bells of their bank accounts\nchime... at a cautious distance of the boss.","The picture caused quite some emotion in China and no...,\nnot because it was an insult of the Great Helmsman or the Communist Party of\nPresident Xi Jinping.","No, it caused commotion because neither Zuckerberg\nnor his assistants wore a face mask, even though the general air pollution and air\nquality in Beijing are sometimes about as bad as they have ever been measured.","As a Western\nguy, I am often puzzled by the Asian habit to wear a face mask under virtually\nall circumstances, but not in case of the air pollution in Beijing.","Even though Helmsman Mao is probably not more than 30-50\nmeters removed from Facebook’s immortal leader, the polluted air clouds his ‘larger\nthan life’ picture on the wall and makes it already quite hard to read the left\npart of the aphorism on the wall. The rest of the picture is akin to a city during\nthe emergence of sea fog, with trees and buildings that vanish at the horizon.\nIt seems like a good place indeed to wear a face mask and probably all visitors\ndo so. But not Mark Zuckerberg...","And that was not to the amusement of some of the Chinese readers, who\nwatched this harmless looking picture in mounting amazement and anger. The\nAlgemeen Dagblad:","The Chinese are\npuzzled about Mark Zuckerberg not wearing a face mask. The level of air\npollution in Beijing is fifteen times higher than considered ‘safe’.\nInhabitants of Beijing wonder whether this gesture by Mark Zuckerberg is the\numpteenth attempt to please the Chinese authorities, who state that they are\nslowly winning the fight against air pollution.","The Chinese journalist\nand adamant runner Peng Yuanwen jokingly\nstated that the lungs of Zuckerberg single-handedly filtered the pollutive\nparticles out of the air of Beijing. “The human vacuum cleaner is obviously better,\nwhen American-made...’, he wrote.","What also surprised\nthe Chinese was that Zuckerberg was obviously able to post a message on\nFacebook, where this is impossible for Chinese citizens, as their Facebook\naccounts are blocked by the government[...].","Others were offended\nby the location of the picture: at Tiananmen Square, where countless insurgent students\nwere murdered in 1989 during their protests for democratic reforms in China[...]","And so a picture, which should radiate success, independence, optimism\nand power/strength as key points for the protagonist, has suddenly turned into\na political hot potato, as a result of the “Law of Unintended Consequences”:","Everything that an\nimportant person does, matters... And often it matters most in the way and\ndirection that this person did not intend...","Normally, the impact of such a picture will blow over in a\ncouple of days, as things normally do. I have little doubt that this particular\npicture soon will also become nothing more than a small pebble in a large pond. It is a relatively harmless picture that only offends genuine insiders\nin the Chinese matters and history and leaves most other viewers indifferent, after the hype has gone.","Nevertheless, this picture is a clear political lesson for Mark Zuckerberg\nand other people ‘of good conduct and great power and integrity’: in China and numerous other countries, everything is political. This is especially true for countries\nwith powerful, but vain leaders of questionable repute, who are looking for\nworldwide influence, recognization and admiration.","Dutch king Willem-Alexander and president Vladimir Putinhaving a cosy beer together at the 2014 Olympic Games in SochiPicture copyright of: EPAPicture for illustratory purposes.

Be careful with that: most government leaders never saw it coming at the time these two guys fell from\ngrace in their home countries. And then THEIR name was mentioned as one of the contagious, former friends of the now hated old leader and (thus) enemies of the new people in charge.","Where political leaders and heads of state play a distinguished and also unavoidable role in keeping up relations with other countries and heads of state – even the not very democratic and sympathetic ones, as a consequence of strategic interests – this is\nmuch less so in the case of Mark Zuckerberg, who is 'just' an influential business-man.","We can only hope that Zuckerberg is AWARE of the terrible\nevents happening on Tiananmen Square in 1989... and of the fact that a lot of Chinese\npeople CAN’T use his tool Facebook, due to the current account blocks and other, more opaque boundaries that the ubiquitous Chinese government has raised\nin order to silence the possible protesters and dissidents within their country.","And does Zuckerberg UNDERSTAND that Beijing is one of the\nmost polluted cities in the world, in which many people die well before their\ntime, due to exhaust gas poisoning? And that this very edition of his daily run in Beijing, being executed without-a-face-mask, might look like grotesque, Chinese government propaganda on behalf of president\nXi Jinping?!","Social media, like Facebook, Twitter, Blogger and Instagram\nhave interconnected the world in a way still deemed impossible in the Nineties\nof last Century. They, however, have also brought forward a generation of thought\nleaders (i.e. the founders and chairmen and -women of these companies), who\nhave far more influence through their words and actions than they might understand themselves.","When these thought leaders use their influence for\nbenevolent causes and positive political influence, this is fantastic and it can\nwork wonders. When they become the subjects of propaganda from questionable\nleaders and countries, on the other hand, they can damage everything for which\nthey stood initially.","So please, Mark Zuckerberg, feel free to run in China, but\ndon’t do it on Tiananmen Square anymore!

You shouldn’t have to wade through complicated privacy settings in order to ensure that the companies with which you’ve entrusted your personal information are making reasonable, legal efforts to protect it. But Facebook has allowed third parties to violate user privacy on an unprecedented scale, and, while legislators and regulators scramble to understand the implications and put limits in place, users are left with the responsibility to make sure their profiles are properly configured.","Over the weekend, it became clear that Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics company, got access to more than 50 million Facebook users’ data in 2014. The data was overwhelmingly collected, shared, and stored without user consent. The scale of this violation of user privacy reflects how Facebook’s terms of service and API were structured at the time. Make no mistake: this was not a data breach. This was exactly how Facebook’s infrastructure was designed to work.","In addition to raising questions about Facebook’s role in the 2016 presidential election, this news is a reminder of the inevitable privacy risks that users face when their personal information is captured, analyzed, indefinitely stored, and shared by a constellation of data brokers, marketers, and social media companies.","Tech companies can and should do more to protect users, including giving users far more control over what data is collected and how that data is used. That starts with meaningful transparency and allowing truly independent researchers—with no bottom line or corporate interest—access to work with, black-box test, and audit their systems. Finally, users need to be able to leave when a platform isn’t serving them — and take their data with them when they do.","Of course, you could choose to leave Facebook entirely, but for many that is not a viable solution, unfortunately. For now, if you’d like keep your data from going through Facebook’s API, you can take control of your privacy settings. Keep in mind that this disables ALL platform apps (like Farmville, Twitter, or Instagram) and you will not be able to log into sites using your Facebook login.","If disabling platform entirely is too much, there is another setting that can help: limiting the personal information accessible by apps that others use. By default, other people who can see your info can bring it with them when they use apps, and your info becomes available to those apps. You can limit this as follows.","From the same page, click “Edit” under “Apps Others Use.” Then uncheck the types of information that you don’t want others’ apps to be able to access. For most people reading this post, that will mean unchecking every category."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

His campaign is gathering signatures with the goal of landing the California Consumer Privacy Act on the November ballot.","“What we are proposing is some very basic rights: Let people find out what information companies are collecting, and let them have the ability to say, ‘Don’t sell my information,’” said Mactaggart, who was inspired to draft the initiative after chatting at a party with a Google engineer who told him that people would freak out if they knew how much companies track, compile and sell their personal information.","Sponsored By","Ever used Evite to invite friends to a religious celebration or a child’s birthday party? Your religion or the age of your child may be for sale. Use a fitness or fertility app? They collect loads of personal information that can be shared — and a study by the Future of Privacy Forum found that some don’t have privacy policies telling users what happens to their data. Use a discount card at the grocery or drug store? Everything you buy is a piece of data about you. Marketing companies compile these billions of bits of data to build profiles of the kind of consumer or voter they think you are.","The measure would give Californians the ability to opt out of having their personal data sold or shared by requiring businesses to display a button on their websites that says, “Do Not Sell My Personal Information.” Clicking the link would take users to an opt-out form.","Mactaggart and his supporters seized on the recent controversy over Cambridge Analytica accessing the data of millions of Facebook users to benefit clients such as the Trump campaign, publicly calling on the company to stop opposing his ballot measure. There’s little reason to think it will.","Though Zuckerberg said on national television that Facebook has a “basic responsibility to protect people’s data,” his company has worked with other Internet giants to beat back numerous efforts to increase consumer privacy. They lobbied against federal legislation last year that would have required tech companies to obtain customers’ permission before selling their data to advertisers. And they lobbied against a bill in the California legislature that would have required Internet service providers to get permission from customers before selling or sharing information about their browsing history.","Now they’re fighting Mactaggart’s measure by warning that it would fundamentally disrupt the 21st Century economy, not only impacting the business of digital advertising, but also hampering many services people have come to rely on. Mapping apps, ride-hailing apps and email subscription services all rely on sharing users’ data. The initiative treats “sharing” data and “selling” data the same, and opponents say such services wouldn’t work if consumers were allowed to opt out of sharing the data. The measure says the opt-out wouldn’t apply when the consumer intentionally discloses personal information (for example, revealing their location when hailing a ride), but opponents maintain the distinction is unworkable.","“Just about every sector of business in the state will oppose this because it’s a direct threat to their vitality,” said Steve Maviglio, spokesman for the tech-funded political committee opposing the privacy initiative, called the Coalition to Protect California Jobs. The committee has backing from the California Chamber of Commerce, TechNet and the Internet Association — a trio of powerful and deep-pocketed interests.","Facebook didn’t respond to request for comment, but it’s a member of TechNet and the Internet Association, which argue that changing the Internet’s rules in one state is impractical because it’s a global network.","“This measure will stifle innovation and send companies to competing states and countries that do not have such job-crushing regulations,” said a statement from TechNet Vice President Andrea Deveau.","The initiative also would allow Californians to sue companies that violate their request not to share personal information — another point of contention for business groups, which almost always oppose policies making it easier for them to be sued.","Consumer groups have been assessing whether the initiative as drafted does what it aims to do. Several now support it, although others including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which litigates civil liberties issues in technology, have not yet taken a position.","Leading the campaign with Mactaggart is Mary Ross, a former CIA analyst who moved to California two years ago. As a counterintelligence analyst, Ross said she helped monitor foreign governments’ efforts to spy on America. So when Mactaggart asked her to join his campaign, Ross said she had “an insider’s perspective” on the power of big data.","“Information is powerful whether it’s a government using it or a business,” Ross said.","“Information is being used to manipulate people and you don’t even know when you’re being manipulated ... Maybe it’s being done to make you buy something or maybe it’s being done to get you to go vote a certain way. But if there is no transparency or accountability, it’s going to continue.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Stamos–one of the more public-facing employees at the company–is parting ways over disagreements with how the company has handled its problem with misinformation.","advertisement","Stamos—who led the team that studied “information operations” on Facebook and Instagram in the wake of the 2016 U.S. election—is known as a prolific tweeter, and has long defended Facebook’s actions when it came to security and political interference. After his day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others in December, he announced his intentions to leave, but was asked to remain on through August, according to today’s Times report. Stamos has been helping his team transition to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions; the security veteran once oversaw over 120, but now reportedly only three people answer to him.","In a tweet this evening, Stamos appeared to dispute the Times story. “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.” He did not address his future plans.","Facebook has come under new fire over revelations that data firm Cambridge Analytica was able to access millions of users’ personal data and use it for political microtargeting. When this news broke, Stamos took to Twitter to defend and contextualize Facebook’s actions, arguing that the incident did not amount to a “data breach.”","“Kogan [the contractor working for Cambridge Analytica] did not break into any systems, bypass any technical controls, or use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed. He did, however, misuse that data after he gathered it, but that does not retroactively make it a ‘breach.'” Stamos later deleted the tweet and others about the incident.","“I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in,” he later tweeted. “There are a lot of big problems that the big tech companies need to be better at fixing.

And the political consulting industry scours the victor’s tactics so they can be sold in the next election cycle, whether they worked, were happenstance, or a mix of the two.","Exhibit A for this dynamic is the 2016 Trump campaign’s use of digital media, especially Facebook. In late February, President Trump named Brad Parscale, his digital director, as his 2020 re-election campaign manager. In the meantime, Parscale has been helping the Republican Party raise millions from small donations online.","“It begs the question, why don’t more campaigns have their digital consultant serve as their campaign manager,” wrotePeter Graves, a media consultant and ex-RNC regional political director for the trade publication, Campaigns and Elections. \"After all, most federal campaigns are doing the majority of their voter contact now online. Moreover, digital is the only space on campaigns that collaborates with every department.”","But what did Parscale do for Trump in 2016 that is setting the standard for 2018?","“If I had to characterize what the Trump campaign did, they automated Facebook’s best [advertising] practices at a very large scale. I think that statewide campaigns will try to do the same kind of thing in 2018,” said Colin Delany, founder of Epolitics. “I’m wondering if any new technology is going to come out of the resistance. It’s possible. I think a lot of what you are seeing is training and capacity building.”","In other words, Democrats are playing catchup to Republicans, compared to 2016, when their presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic National Committee—under a series of chairwomen—were more focused on older media platforms like TV, rather than new platforms like social media.","To begin to understand how Parscale, an online advertising specialist, went from building websites for Trump products, to running Trump’s online messaging and fundraising in 2016, to assisting the RNC with small donor outreach in 2018, to being named Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, you have to examine how Parscale used Facebook.","Consultants like Delany are quick to say they can’t tell you how the Trump campaign’s messaging specifically affected voters when they cast ballots. But they can say how Parscale used Facebook, which revolutionized how national campaigns targeted and messaged likely voters.","If you roll back the clock to before the internet, a baseline emerges showing how much has changed. When I was press secretary on the 1990 campaign that first elected Bernie Sanders to the House of Representatives, I remember picking up a half-dozen TV ads for the campaign’s final stretch. Bernie looked at the stack of 30-second videos and said his future rested on those tapes. That was a statewide race in a rural state with small media markets, but compare its scale to what Parscale and Facebook did for Trump.","It’s no secret. An October 2016 in-depth report by Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg for Bloomberg.com laid out the basics. It started with indentifying persuadable voters in swing states, and then sending messaging poking at their biases and personality types. More recent reports, such as this weekend's Guardian report featuring a Trump campaign whistleblower, added more detail showing how powerful Facebook's user profiles were in 2016.","The Trump campaign took voter files from the Republican Party, which had people’s electoral histories—age, gender, address, party registration and voting histories. They took more personalized data by Cambridge Analytica, the data-mining firm run by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, which boasted it had pyschologically profiles of every voter. (On Friday, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica for not deleting data taken from the social network in 2016 to create its voter profiles. The Guardian reported Cambridge Analytica's data was culled from 50 million to 60 million Facebook user profiles it had stolen before it joined the Trump campaign.)","The campaign put all that voter profiling data into Facebook’s advertising supercomputers, which had its own deep profiles of users based on their pages, communications and networks. Facebook provided staffers to every major campaign in 2016 to facilitate this process. From that data merging and data mining, Parscale oversaw an operation that identified 13.5 million Facebook users in 16 states that it deemed were persuadable. It targeted those individuals with the kind of personality-driven content that social media emphasizes—more opinion, belief and bias than facts.","The Trump campaign didn’t just send out original content, noted Melissa Ryan, who writes the Ctrl Alt Right Delete newsletter. “The Trump campaign put out relatively few ideas of their own,” she explained on Medium.com. “Instead they chose to validate and amplify the conversation happening online. They didn’t need to confirm or deny anything, they simply gave Trump’s army their megaphone… [It] put their supporters one content front and center, taking a backseat in their own campaign.”","“They were banking that people are more likely to believe something from an unofficial source that seems true rather than to believe something from an official source that actually is true,” Ryan explained. “Once they realized there was no line to cross, they went all in using social media to bully and intimidate others, spread misinformation, and mainstream the language of hate. Those who spoke out were met with a flood of abuse, and that abuse was organized. Their targets had few places to turn as tech companies turned a blind eye, and law enforcement was of little help.”","By late October, days before former FBI director James Comey announced the FBI was reopening its investigation into Clinton’s handling of classified emails, the Bloomberg reporting team said Parscale’s crew of subcontractors had determined “which social media ads [messages, memes, shares, etc.] were most effective. Those companies test ad variations against one another—the campaign ultimately generated 100,000 distinct pieces of creative content—and then roll out the strongest performers to broader audiences.”","Facebook allowed Parscale to build and target what it calls “custom audiences,” as ex-Facebook executive Antonio Garcia-Martinez explained in a Wired piece, “How Trump Conquered Facebook—Without Russian Ads.” Its custom audience consisted of all the impressionable voters—Trump enthusiasts on one hand, Democrats dubious about Clinton on the other—who could be encouraged to vote or encouraged not to.","Then the campaign used another Facebook advertising feature built atop that preliminary customization called “Lookalike Audiences.” It targeted another wider circle of Facebook users in the swing constituencies in swing states. Some of this was to keep Trump’s base engaged. Some was to discourage three key columns of Clinton supporters from voting. As Bloomberg noted, “idealistic white liberal, young women and African Americans” were the targets of Trump’s three voter suppression campaigns.","Garcia-Martinez, the original product manager for \"Custom Audiences,” explained how the Trump campaign targeted audiences and then fed it content, often propaganda from other online sources. This explains how Breitbart.com temporarily had more traffic than Fox News in the campaign’s final weeks. But Garcia-Martinez’s explanation also alludes to platform features that are designed to be psychologically engaging and provoke emotional responses. It starts with creating political echo chambers filled with like-minded associates.","“We’ve all contributed to this political balkanization by self-sorting (or being sorted by Facebook) into online tribes that get morphed into filter bubbles, which are then studiously colonized by commercial memes planted and spread there by a combination of Custom and Lookalike Audiences,” he wrote. “One of the ways the Trump campaign leveraged Lookalike Audiences was through its voter suppression campaigns among likely Clinton voters. They seeded the Audiences assembly line with content about Clinton that was engaging but dispiriting. This is one of the ways that Trump won the election, by the very tools that were originally built to help companies like Bed Bath & Beyond sell you towels.”","Colin Delany, the online media consultant and author on the topic, is quick to point out that it’s impossible to trace how all this messaging affected voters’ behavior when they cast their 2016 ballots. That’s because the thread Parscale could observe—whether messaging recipients liked, commented on or shared his handiwork—was broken as voters put down their devices and picked up ballots.","But Delany said there was another metric that confirmed how powerful and engaging Facebook was before 2016’s Election Day. It helped raise a fortune for Trump.","“Now one of the main things with Facebook is this is one of the few operations that I’ve heard of that’s been able to raise a significant amount of money by targeting people on Facebook,” he said. “Now my suspicion is that almost all the money actually got raised by email. But they would identify and recruit the people via Facebook.”","“If you can get them to respond to the first fundraising pitch and give you $5, then you are in their email program. Or you get them to sign a petition. You get them to do whatever it is that gets them the email address,” Delany said. “The small donor lists that the RNC is using to pretty good effect right now comes out of the work that Parscale did for Trump. If you want to look for results, I think you can look to social media fundraising.”","Seen from that metric, there’s no denying the political power of social media. With 10 days to go before Election Day, Bloomberg reported that Parscale’s operation raised $275 million from 2.5 million small donors. That’s more than the nearly $238 million raised by the Sanders presidential campaign from his grassroots base. Think about that: Parscale’s operation outraised Bernie’s operation—but Parscale isn’t bragging about it.","The Clinton campaign, as many political insiders and former Facebook executives have said, didn’t use Facebook as aggressively. In one intriguing series of recent tweets, these tech and political insiders said that Democrats in general rely more on TV ads than online messaging, partly because political consultants can earn more that way. They also said her campaign was relying on dated internal assessments by Facebook (from 2010) about its affects on voter participation, and that overall, its campaigns discounted—and didn’t sufficiently study—“observational political science,” or how voters responded to social media provocations in focus groups.","These cringe-worthy observations are part and parcel of political campaigns, which are like startups that rapidly pop up and then mostly disappear after Election Day. Political campaigns are perpetually in search of messaging and fundraising infrastructure they can use; just as institutions like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have created infrastructure seeking new users. Garcia-Martinez, reached by email, said he was stunned by how little political professionals—and academics who study politics—know about advertising.","“My recent [Wired] piece tossed me into a few threads with political/election/academic Twitter, and I found it a very strange world,” he wrote. “Very punctiliously following strict experimental protocols and the scientific method, and also not knowing the first f**king thing about how to advertise on Facebook (their studies measure what they can as outsiders, which isn't much). It is a leap of faith to just assume Facebook ads work for politics.... but without question, they work for more commercial direct-response advertisers.”","His takeaway: “Parscale is hailed as this genius, but all he did is what any reasonably savvy ecommerce operation would have done, and that set him way beyond Hillary and the supposedly ‘best and brightest.’ Which is why, as Delany and Graves, campaign media consultants and columnists, said, social media will be at the center of 2018’s elections for control of Congress and constitutional offices in swing states."],"isopubdate":""}

Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica, a data-analysis firm that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, over allegations that it held onto improperly obtained user data after telling Facebook it had deleted the information. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)","One of the largest data leaks in Facebook history allowed Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to Trump campaign strategist Steve Bannon, to develop techniques that formed the basis of its work on the Trump campaign, The New York Times and The Guardian reported.","Facebook said it suspended Cambridge Analytica over allegations that it kept the improperly obtained user data after telling Facebook it had been deleted.","In a blog post, Facebook explained that Cambridge Analytica had years ago received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm was not authorized to have the information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report.","Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of Kogan's data was used in its 2016 election work for the \"avoidance of doubt.\"","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","The Facebook blog post, written by deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Trump's general-election campaign.","Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","\"The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\"","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.","A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.","The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.","Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized. Flynn is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference after pleading guilty to a felony charge.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nix said Assange denied the request, which came after Assange had said publicly that he had the emails. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.","Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling.","Revelations that Cambridge Analytica misused social media data could also be of interest to Mueller's investigation. While much of the thrust of special counsel's investigation has been tightly held, Mueller has requested that the firm turn over the emails of any employees who worked on the campaign, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last year.","Mueller is also looking at the role Wikileaks played in acquiring and making public the stolen Clinton campaign emails.","Facebook's recurring nightmare: Helping muddy up elections","MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) — Facebook has a problem it just can't kick: People keep exploiting it in ways that could sway elections, and in the worst cases even undermine democracy.","News reports that Facebook let the Trump-affiliated data mining firm Cambridge Analytica abscond with data from tens of millions of users mark the third time in roughly a year the company appears to have been outfoxed by crafty outsiders in this way.","Before the Cambridge imbroglio, there were Russian agents running election-related propaganda campaigns through targeted ads and fake political events. And before the Russians took center stage, there were purveyors of fake news who spread false stories to rile up hyperpartisan audiences and profit from the resulting ad revenue.","In the previous cases, Facebook initially downplayed the risks posed by these activities. It only seriously grappled with fake news and Russian influence after sustained criticism from users, experts and politicians. In the case of Cambridge, Facebook says the main problem involved the transfer of data to a third party — not its collection in the first place.","Each new issue has also raised the same enduring questions about Facebook's conflicting priorities — to protect its users, but also to ensure that it can exploit their personal details to fuel its hugely lucrative, and precisely targeted, advertising business.","Facebook may say its business model is to connect the world, but it's really \"to collect psychosocial data on users and sell that to advertisers.\" said Mike Caulfield, a faculty trainer at Washington State University who directs a multi-university effort focused on digital literacy.","Late Friday, Facebook announced it was banning Cambridge , an outfit that helped Donald Trump win the White House, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded a purported research app described as a personality test. Facebook first learned of this breach of privacy more than two years ago, but hasn't mentioned it publicly until now.","And the company may still be playing down its scope. Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge employee who served as a key source for detailed investigative reports published Saturday in The New York Times and The Guardian , said the firm was actually able to pull in data from roughly 50 million profiles by extending its tentacles to the unwitting friends of app users. (Facebook has since barred such second-hand data collection by apps.)","Wylie said he regrets the role he played in what he called \"a full service propaganda machine.\" Cambridge's goal, he told the Guardian in a video interview, was to use the Facebook data to build detailed profiles that could be used to identify and then to target individual voters with personalized political messages calculated to sway their opinions.","\"It was a grossly unethical experiment,\" Wylie said. \"Because you are playing with an entire country. The psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.\"","Cambridge has denied wrongdoing and calls Wylie a disgruntled former employee. It acknowledged obtaining user data in violation of Facebook policies, but blamed a middleman contractor for the problem. The company said it never used the data and deleted it all once it learned of the infraction — an assertion contradicted by Wylie and now under investigation by Facebook.","Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, said Facebook badly needs to embrace the transparency it has essentially forced on its users by sharing their habits, likes and dislikes with advertisers. Albright has previously noted cases in which Facebook deleted thousands of posts detailing Russian influence on its service and underreported the audience for Russian posts by failing to mention millions of followers on Instagram, which Facebook owns.","Facebook is \"withholding information to the point of negligence,\" he said Saturday. \"How many times can you keep doing that before it gets to the point where you're not going to be able to wrangle your way out?\"","The Cambridge imbroglio also revealed what appear to be loopholes in Facebook's privacy assurances, particularly regarding third-party apps. Facebook appears to have no technical way to enforce privacy promises made by app developers, leaving users little choice but to simply trust them.","In fact, the enforcement actions outlined in Facebook's statement don't address prevention at all — just ways to respond to violations after they've occurred.","On Saturday, Facebook continued to insist that the Cambridge data collection was not a \"data breach\" because \"everyone involved gave their consent\" to share their data. The purported research app followed Facebook's existing privacy rules, no systems were surreptitiously infiltrated and no one stole passwords or sensitive information without permission. (To Facebook, the only real violation was the transfer of information collected for \"research\" to a third party such as Cambridge.)","Experts say that argument only makes sense if every user fully understands Facebook's obscure privacy settings, which often default to maximal data sharing.","\"It's a disgusting abuse of privacy,\" said Larry Ponemon, founder of the privacy research firm Ponemon Institute. \"In general, most of these privacy settings are superficial,\" he said. \"Companies need to do more to make sure commitments are actually met.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

This is a quote from an excellent article in The New York Times:","“One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives.”","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job it is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules.","Alex Stamos, Facebook’s security chief, has reportedly resigned over this issue and said in a statement: “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.”","The heart of the issue is money and how to get it","So what is this “central tension” eating at Facebook like an untreatable disease?","In 2012, I wrote a blog post predicting that Facebook would become the most evil company on earth. The post received a weird reaction since at that time Facebook had about the same sort of popularity as Disney. My argument was not about the people or the culture. I predicted that Facebook would become evil because it had no choice. I wrote:","“Virtually the entire economic model of Facebook is based on a single tactic — collect as much personal information about you as possible as a way to sell highly-targeted ads. So for Facebook to succeed, it simply must collect increasing amounts of information about you. More information = more ad revenue.","“So we have to consider — Is this relentless collection of information and selling of ads sustainable in a way that meets Wall Street’s expectations for continuous and aggressive growth?","“Will we reach a saturation point where it becomes impossible for Facebook to squeeze any more information from us? Will we reach a day when Facebook’s insatiable need for data becomes annoying and invasive? Is there a theoretical limit to information gathering?”","In essence, I predicted that Facebook would become evil because it would have to find bolder and bolder ways to turn our personal information into profits.","The heart of the problem","And this quote I published from The New York Times shows my prediction was correct, and it is at the very heart of these Facebook controversies.","The “central tension” at Facebook is between the security team (wanting to do the right thing) and the commercial team (wanting to do the profitable thing). A few weeks ago, as complaints against Facebook mounted — legal issues, health issues, ethical issues — I noted that Facebook could not solve its own problems and this vicious, endless cycle of turning personal information into profits would just make the commercial situation worse and worse.","NYT: Is the basic economic model of Facebook, in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users — do you feel like that works, given what we now know about the risks?","Zuckerberg: “Yeah, so this is a really important question. The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that — our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together. And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford. A lot of the people, once you get past the first billion people, can’t afford to pay a lot. Therefore, having it be free and have a business model that is ad-supported ends up being really important and aligned.","“Now, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That’s certainly something we’ve thought about over time. But I don’t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it’s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.”","Taking Facebook private","Sure, there is the issue of the Facebook “mission,” but the larger problem is, if Zuckerberg allowed people to subscribe to an ad-free and more secure Facebook, the entire ad model would crumble. Advertisers presumably would have access to those unable to afford a subscription … not very appealing to most brands. And this would undoubtedly open the doors for a competitor.","So the problem is unlikely to be resolved by Facebook. Unless …","Facebook has to make dramatic changes to right the ship … changes that would almost certainly hurt the stock price. As long as Zuckerberg and his company have that excruciating pressure from Wall Street, the organization simply cannot make the dramatic systemic changes it needs to survive.","So, Zuckerberg needs to take the company private. It is the only solution I think that can save the company and truly position it for the long-term.","There is precedence for this of course, most recently Michael Dell took his massive tech company private in 2013 so it could better focus on long-term growth instead of managing to a quarterly profit.","Similarly, Facebook needs the breathing room right now to relieve this “central tension” and focus on the critical systemic issues that are slowly destroying the company and its reputation.","Going private could:","Reduce regulatory, administrative, and reporting requirements and free up money to focus on long-term goals.","Allow Facebook to re-create the company through new business models and monetization schemes without the relentless pressure of “beating the Street” every quarter.","Being private frees up management’s time and effort to concentrate on running and growing a business and addressing some of these ethical issues like fake news and social media addiction. At the beginning of the year, Mark Zuckerberg pledged to “fix Facebook.” Going private would help him focus on realities other than stock price.","I’m not a finance expert and I haven’t carefully studied the Facebook balance sheet, but I think the company has a strong enough cash flow and access to capital that it could operate very successfully as a private firm (although it would need to remain profitable … that would not go away).","Somehow, Zuckerberg needs to resolve this “central tension” causing the crisis at his company and there is no way to do that and meet Wall Street’s expectations at the same time."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.”","Facebook shares fell as much as 6.5 percent, briefly dipping below $150 for the first time since July 2017, before recovering the day’s losses to close up 0.4 percent at $160.06.","The shares are still down 13 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica. The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.","Related Coverage","The recovery in Facebook’s stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company’s relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.","The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.","If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.","ALL APOLOGIES","Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company’s privacy practices.","The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.","The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.","“Facebook’s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,” said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.","Slideshow (3 Images)","In Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is “absolutely certain” that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.","Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers’ access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.","“The was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time,” Zuckerberg said in the ads. “We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”","‘FUTURE REGULATION’","His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany’s justice minister said Facebook’s promises were not enough.","“In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,” Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.","Advertisers and users are also unhappy.","U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet’s YouTube for one week.","Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.","Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.","Reporting by David Shepardson; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Susan Thomas"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

As a New Zealand-based developer discovered, the social media giant collected massive amounts of phone data on some of its users, including call logs with phone numbers and contact info, and metadata like time and location for SMS messages sent and received. As Ars Technica subsequently discovered, the troubling data collection practice extended—for years—to just about any Android user, as long as they gave Facebook access to their contacts at some point.","According to Ars Technica, the data-sharing was the result of a lax feature in Android's API (application program interface) that granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. Because of a loophole, Facebook was able to keep scraping that data without explicitly asking for permission even once an updated Android API that fixed the issue was released in 2012. It seems this was only an issue with Android's API, and iPhone users were unaffected by the issue.","To see what kind of data Facebook has on you, whether you're an Android user or not, you can download your full Facebook archive by going into your settings and clicking on the link at the bottom of the \"General\" tab. One you download the ZIP file, open the file named index.htm and navigate to \"contact info\" in the sidebar. In the future, don't say yes if Facebook asks for permission to access your contacts.","In a blog post on March 25, Facebook denied that it inappropriately scraped call and text data from users' phones, saying that those logs were part of an opt-in feature that Android users had to explicitly agree to. According to Ars Technica, this contradicted the experiences of several Android users whom reporter Sean Gallagher spoke to.","Facebook's privacy practices have been under intense scrutiny lately, for good reason. The company recently took out full-page ads in several major newspapers apologizing for the ongoing Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook's data-sharing rules allowed the political consulting firm to inappropriately gather data on tens of millions of users. The company is now being investigated by the FTC, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also been invited to testify before Congress about the site's privacy practices.","In general, if you don't want Facebook to share data on your every online move with third parties, you'd be wise to limit the amount of information you give it in the first place. Refrain from telling it things like where you went to school, where you work, what your birthday is, and who your siblings are. Remove your phone number or use a Google Voice number in place of your cell phone number, and again, certainly don't let the service comb through your contact list. If you like to get creative, this is one situation where it's perfectly ethical to lie. (Avoiding sharing real data with the company can also double as a good way to foil hackers combing the site for information on you.)","After you download your Facebook archive, it would also be worth it to check out which advertisers have your data from the site. You can turn off targeted advertising by going to your ad settings and unchecking all of the different interests Facebook labels you as having, disassociating yourself from that time you \"liked\" the Dr. Pepper fan page or clicked on an ad for a cute t-shirt you saw on the site. And for more about how to limit the information about you that Facebook gives to third-party apps, read on here."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Her friend Linda Leonhart agrees: “I will definitely take a look to see who has the courage to take on a job like this and do what needs to be done.”CreditCreditAllison V. Smith for The New York Times","By Michael Tackett","March 11, 2018","GRAPEVINE, Tex. — Carol Rains, a white evangelical Christian, has no regrets over her vote for President Trump. She likes most of his policies and would still support him over any Democrat. But she is open to another Republican.","“I would like for someone to challenge him,” Ms. Rains said, as she sipped wine recently with two other evangelical Christian women at a suburban restaurant north of Dallas. “But it needs to be somebody that’s strong enough to go against the Democrats.” Her preferred alternative: Nikki R. Haley, the United Nations ambassador and former South Carolina governor.","One of her friends, Linda Leonhart, agreed. “I will definitely take a look to see who has the courage to take on a job like this and do what needs to be done,” she said.","According to data from the Pew Research Center, support among white evangelical women in recent surveys has dropped about 13 percentage points, to 60 percent, compared with about a year ago. That is even greater than the eight-point drop among all women.","“That change is statistically significant,” said Gregory A. Smith, Pew’s associate director of research, who also noted a nine-point drop among evangelical men. “Both groups have become less approving over time.”","If that drop in support translates into a lack of enthusiasm among core Trump supporters in the midterm elections in November, as it did for many of President Barack Obama’s voters in 2010, the Republican Party could be more vulnerable in its efforts to maintain control of Congress. In 2020, it would also possibly open a lane for a primary challenger to the president.","The women in suburban Dallas all conceded they have cringed sometimes at Mr. Trump, citing his pettiness, impulsiveness, profanity and name calling. Still, they defended him because he delivered on issues they cared most about, such as the appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.","“Certainly we are all embarrassed, but for the most part he represents what we stand for,” said Ms. Leonhart, who is active in the women’s ministry at her church.","A clear majority of white evangelical women, even in the face of the #MeToo movement and renewed claims of marital infidelity against the president, continue, along with white evangelical men, to form Mr. Trump’s most cohesive block of support.","Mr. Trump’s ability to connect so strongly with evangelical voters was among the most notable surprises of the 2016 campaign. Since his election, he has courted evangelical leaders aggressively and, more important, has delivered on promises to appoint conservatives like Justice Gorsuch to federal courts. Men who see themselves as leaders of religious conservatives, such as Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell Jr. and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, have remained doggedly supportive.","And the majority of evangelical women remain in his corner.","But it has not been easy.","“I don’t know any evangelical woman who is going to defend the character of the president,” said Carmen Fowler LaBerge, host of “The Reconnect,” an evangelical-centered radio show.","“Many things the president says and does are things that many evangelicals use as examples with our kids of what we should not do,” added Ms. LaBerge, who did not support Mr. Trump in 2016. “This is not who we are as evangelicals. This is not how we treat people.”","Some evangelical women simply keep their views private. Gathered at a well-appointed home in Falls Church, Va., last week, eight Christian women agreed to talk about their feelings about the president, on one condition: that they not be identified.","They feared reprisal in the workplace, at their children’s schools, even at their church. They meet in secret and have a private Facebook group, which its organizer said has about 160 members, to talk about their support for Mr. Trump.","They said that Christian voters who backed Trump had been derided as unthinking, unsophisticated hypocrites, but for many of them that only affirmed their resolve. One of the women said that her parents had come to the United States illegally from El Salvador and that she was born a short time later. Her father is now a citizen. She supports Mr. Trump and his hard-line plans on immigration.","“I would say that this year has only made me more of a certain supporter,” said another of the women, Joanna, who agreed to be identified only by her first name. “I’ve been really excited to see him come through with his promises, one by one, against incredible odds.”","Still, there is a tension among evangelical women. They said they largely cast their votes against Hillary Clinton more than for Mr. Trump.","“At least in my experience, it was more of an anti-Hillary vote than a pro-Trump vote,” Ms. LaBerge said.","Karen Swallow Prior, a professor at Liberty University who opposed Mr. Trump and voted for a third-party candidate, said, “Now that Trump is in office and we are evaluating his performance then, I am glad to see that people are less in lock step and thinking critically about him as a leader, and it doesn’t surprise me that his overall support would decline from 80 percent.”","“I was one of those culture war evangelicals in the ’80s and ’90s,” Ms. Swallow Prior said. “I was appalled by the candidacy and presidency of Bill Clinton. It was hammered into my mind that character mattered, and that did change when Trump came along. In some ways, I felt betrayed by my evangelical peers who taught me and cemented in me the idea that character matters. I didn’t abandon that belief. I feel like some evangelicals did.”","Evangelical voters, often portrayed as a monolith, are becoming increasingly difficult to define. The support for Mr. Trump reflects a growing pragmatism among evangelical voters who are willing to accept a less than ideal model of Christian faith in exchange for policies that they endorse.","“I think they’ve become experienced and very practical,” said Frances FitzGerald, the author of the recent book “The Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America.” “By large majorities they used to believe that to be elected, you had to be of good character. No longer. It’s ‘We want a president to do what we want him to do, and he’s going to do it if we turn out and vote.’”","Mr. Trump also appeals to white evangelicals in other ways with his strong language, disruptive view of presidential norms and his policies on taxes. “Religious right rhetoric has always been very martial — isolationist and martial at the same time,” Ms. FitzGerald said.","In surveys conducted by LifeWay Research in Nashville, evangelical voters in 2016 cited the economy (30 percent) and national security (26 percent) as their top two issues. Abortion was cited by just 4 percent, said Scott McConnell, the company’s executive director.","Evangelical voters began to emerge as a political force with their support for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and became a more coherent movement with the 1988 presidential campaign of the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and the rise of Christian Coalition. But there are now few obvious leaders of religious conservatism, and voters have become more conventional in their assessment of candidates.","And even among religious conservatives, the Pew poll suggests tolerance for Mr. Trump has its limits.","“It may simply be that there’s not a single breaking point as much as a tipping point, the ‘Oh Lord, I can’t stand another one of these,’” said William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University and author of “With God on Our Side,” which charted the political rise of the religious right.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: White Evangelical Women, Core Trump Supporters, Are Tiptoeing Away.

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly “legitimate way and through proper channels” when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie.","Kogan’s app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Advertisement - story continues below","It seems that Facebook allowed Kogan’s app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as “likes,” because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators. Kogan was reportedly able to create more than 50 million profiles using the trend and characteristics data before providing them to Cambridge.","“Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” Wylie said of Cambridge, according to The New York Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Do you think this company helped Trump win the election as Facebook claims?","YesNo","Completing this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge.

Click here to log out.","Tech companies like Google, Twitter, and especially Facebook, have been hammered with criticism from a large portion of the population — including lawmakers — for purportedly helping Trump win the 2016 election with the platform’s inherent offerings.","How much social media campaigns actually had an effect on election results appears dubious, or at least unclear, and may not even be quantifiable. What is more clear is that Facebook’s features can help sow seeds of further discord by allowing operators to capitalize on polarization.","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology, said in a statement. “While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways.”","Advertisement - story continues below","Severalreports, including The New York Times’ one, are referring to the actions of Cambridge Analytica — which had social media prowess described as the “secret sauce” to Trump’s political campaign — as a data “breach.”","But as noted by Grewal in an update made Saturday morning, “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false” because Kogan requested and gained access through permissible, in fact, standard, means. “Everyone involved gave their consent,” said Grewal.","Facebook says it is subjecting all apps that seek personal user information to its App Review process, “which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.”","Founded by Tucker Carlson, a 25-year veteran of print and broadcast media, and Neil Patel, former chief policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, The Daily Caller News Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit providing original investigative reporting from a team of professional reporters that operates for the public benefit."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Bowery Farming, whose vegetables are now sold in a few grocery stores in New York City, has collected money from the likes of Google’s venture arm and General Catalyst.","Sensei is focused more on wellness. While the company ultimately plans to expand into an array of businesses, its initial focus is on hydroponic farming, using software and sensors to monitor growing conditions. (Its first farm is on Lanai, the Hawaiian island of which Mr. Ellison owns roughly 98 percent.)","Sensei’s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.","“So far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,” Dr. Agus said in a statement. “To properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.”","Its first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.","But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.","“For so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,” Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei’s president, said in a statement. “Now, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.”","Facebook’s slide drags down FANG stocks.","Facebook’s stock had its worst day in about four years.","Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.","The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world’s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry’s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.","Facebook’s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.","“We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group.","Facebook’s woes showed signs of spreading, too.","The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index’s 11 sectors.","Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.","In all, Monday’s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.","Fund flows added fuel to the selloff. MoneyBeat’s Akane Otani reports that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds tracking U.S. technology stocks posted a record $2.6 billion in net inflows last week, according to data from fund tracker EPFR Global. That put year-to-date inflows at $47.5 billion.","Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.","The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 336 points, or 1.35 percent, while the S.&P. 500, was off nearly 39 points, or 1.42 percent.","Photo","A senator demanded that Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a British lawmaker has called for him to testify in an inquiry into the “Brexit” referendum.Credit\nJim Wilson/The New York Times","The latest test to Zuckerberg’s leadership.","Is Mark Zuckerberg’s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?","The giant social media company is under the spotlight because a political data firm apparently misused information about more than 50 million Facebook users. Facebook is still facing questions about Russia-linked accounts that had significant reach within the United States through the social network. In both cases, Facebook has struggled to show the public that it can get in front of its problems. Information about the Russia-linked accounts came out piecemeal, and Facebook knew as early as 2015 that the political data firm had violated its data policies.","Mr. Zuckerberg at first downplayed concerns about Facebook’s role in the 2016 presidential election (something he later said he regretted). His recent communications contain more high-minded deliberation than hard discussion of the company’s problems and how to deal with them.","These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.","Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company’s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook’s profitability. Indeed, there’s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg’s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.","In the near term, though, it’s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook’s extraordinary profitability – its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue – will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.","If governments propose restrictions on using members’ data, Facebook’s business model would be tested. The company’s board, in theory, should press Mr. Zuckerberg for details on how he will deal with such shackles. But prominent board members like Marc L. Andreessen and Peter A. Thiel are skeptical of regulation. Facebook might be tempted to fight back.","Lawmakers may hold the line, however, sensing that the public has real concerns about the company. And if Facebook’s responses look tardy and inadequate, the consequences could be harsh, as the fate of Wells Fargo shows. Mr. Zuckerberg, in his uniquely dominant position, is the one person who can make sure this doesn’t happen.","— Peter Eavis","Lawmakers want answers on Facebook’s latest controversy","Lawmakers in the U.S. and Britain want Mark Zuckerberg to explain how Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm founded by Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer, harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.","What happened:The NYT and The Observer of London reported how Cambridge had collected data from an outside researcher to better target Facebook users. Christopher Wylie, who oversaw Cambridge’s data collection until 2014, told the NYT of his former company, “For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","Facebook argued that the incident wasn’t a data breach and that Cambridge had committed a violation. But former Federal Trade Commission officials told the WaPo that Facebook may have violated a privacy pact reached with the regulator. (The tech giant is reviewing whether one of its employees had been aware of the data leak.)","More on Cambridge Analytica: Alexander Nix, the company’s chief, is facing scrutiny over business dealings with Russian interests. Mr. Wylie said that one Russian company, the oil giant Lukoil, appeared more interested in political message targeting than commercial uses. And Cambridge is reportedly trying to block the airing of a report by Channel 4, a British television channel, in which reporters went undercover at the firm.","“Facebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn’t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.”","Photo","A fleet of self-driving Uber cars in 2016.

The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p.m. The woman was not publicly identified.","Uber said it had suspended testing of its self-driving cars in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.","“Our hearts go out to the victim’s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,” an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.","The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver’s seat. This month, California said that, in April, it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel.","— Daisuke Wakabayashi","Photo","Michael W.

The firm connected with Trump’s political adviser Steve Bannon, whom Wylie also met, the reports said.","‘I do feel responsible’","Wylie, a 28-year-old from British Columbia, is the data scientist who spoke out about the controversy. He’s also the man who helped found Cambridge Analytica.","The reports provided many details about the whistleblower who in 2007 or 2008 landed his first political gig with the federal Liberals.","At age 17, he worked in the office of Canada’s opposition leader, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stéphane Dion, said one of the reports. When he was 18 years old, the newspaper said he learned all about data while working for officials on former U.S. president Barack Obama’s campaign team, and later introduced one director to the Liberals.","A senior source with the Liberal Party said Sunday that Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to publicly discuss staffing details.","However, former Liberal officials from that time said they either hadn’t heard of Wylie — or they barely remembered him.","“I vaguely recall him,” wrote one former senior official in an email Sunday. “I think that he was a summer intern.”","Another former senior Liberal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he asked former colleagues Sunday and some people remembered Wylie. They say he was “pretty junior” and worked in the data strategy and communications space.","One former party official, however, said while they didn’t know Wylie well, they remembered him as a “big advocate of microtargetting.”","Liberal Party insists it doesn’t sell information","One of the newspaper reports said Wylie came up with the idea behind Cambridge Analytica at age 24.","The article also said Wylie was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia as a teen and left school at 16 years old without any qualifications. After working for the Liberals and Obama’s campaign, the report said he taught himself to code at age 19 and later studied law at the London School of Economics.","The reports also said Cambridge Analytica played a major role in the referendum that led to Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.","Rampant social media misuse puts future of popular platforms at risk","Data firm that helped elect Trump built psychological profiles of nearly every U.S. voter","Another article published May 2017 by The Guardian quoted a source that connected Wylie to a web analytics company in Victoria, B.C., called AggregateIQ.

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

By early summer, the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app. The researcher scraped private data from over 50 million Facebook users — and Cambridge Analytica went into business selling so-called psychometric profiles of American voters, setting itself on a collision course with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain.","Image","Mr. Thiel at Trump Tower in Manhattan.

Trump and other Republican candidates in 2016. Mr. Thiel, a supporter of President Trump, serves on the board at Facebook.","“There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data,” said Christopher Wylie, a data expert and Cambridge Analytica co-founder, in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday.","Cambridge Analytica has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports about the firm’s data harvesting were published this month in The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian.","Image","“There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data,” said Christopher Wylie, a Cambridge Analytica co-founder, in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday.CreditParliamentary Recording Unit, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images","The connections between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica were thrust into the spotlight by Mr. Wylie’s testimony on Tuesday. Both companies are linked to tech-driven billionaires who backed Mr. Trump’s campaign: Cambridge is chiefly owned by Robert Mercer, the computer scientist and hedge fund magnate, while Palantir was co-founded in 2003 by Mr. Thiel, who was an initial investor in Facebook.","The Palantir employee, Alfredas Chmieliauskas, works on business development for the company, according to his LinkedIn page. In an initial statement, Palantir said it had “never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica, nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.” Later on Tuesday, Palantir revised its account, saying that Mr. Chmieliauskas was not acting on the company’s behalf when he advised Mr. Wylie on the Facebook data.","“We learned today that an employee, in 2013-2014, engaged in an entirely personal capacity with people associated with Cambridge Analytica,” the company said. “We are looking into this and will take the appropriate action.”","The company said it was continuing to investigate but knew of no other employees who took part in the effort. Mr. Wylie told lawmakers that multiple Palantir employees played a role.","Documents and interviews indicate that starting in 2013, Mr. Chmieliauskas began corresponding with Mr. Wylie and a colleague from his Gmail account. At the time, Mr. Wylie and the colleague worked for the British defense and intelligence contractor SCL Group, which formed Cambridge Analytica with Mr. Mercer the next year. The three shared Google documents to brainstorm ideas about using big data to create sophisticated behavioral profiles, a product code-named “Big Daddy.”","A former intern at SCL — Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of Eric Schmidt, then Google’s executive chairman — urged the company to link up with Palantir, according to Mr. Wylie’s testimony and a June 2013 email viewed by The Times.","“Ever come across Palantir. Amusingly Eric Schmidt’s daughter was an intern with us and is trying to push us towards them?” one SCL employee wrote to a colleague in the email.","Ms. Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica.","In early 2013, Alexander Nix, an SCL director who became chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and a Palantir executive discussed working together on election campaigns.","A Palantir spokeswoman acknowledged that the companies had briefly considered working together but said that Palantir declined a partnership, in part because executives there wanted to steer clear of election work. Emails reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Nix and Mr. Chmieliauskas sought to revive talks about a formal partnership through early 2014, but Palantir executives again declined.","In his testimony, Mr. Wylie acknowledged that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica never signed a contract or entered into a formal business relationship. But he said some Palantir employees helped engineer Cambridge’s psychographic models.","“There were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Mr. Wylie told lawmakers. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.” He did not provide an exact number for the employees or identify them.","Palantir employees were impressed with Cambridge’s backing from Mr. Mercer, one of the world’s richest men, according to messages viewed by The Times. And Cambridge Analytica viewed Palantir’s Silicon Valley ties as a valuable resource for launching and expanding its own business.","In an interview this month with The Times, Mr. Wylie said that Palantir employees were eager to learn more about using Facebook data and psychographics. Those discussions continued through spring 2014, according to Mr. Wylie.","Mr. Wylie said that he and Mr. Nix visited Palantir’s London office on Soho Square. One side was set up like a high-security office, Mr. Wylie said, with separate rooms that could be entered only with particular codes. The other side, he said, was like a tech start-up — “weird inspirational quotes and stuff on the wall and free beer, and there’s a Ping-Pong table.”","Mr. Chmieliauskas continued to communicate with Mr. Wylie’s team in 2014, as the Cambridge employees were locked in protracted negotiations with a researcher at Cambridge University, Michal Kosinski, to obtain Facebook data through an app Mr. Kosinski had built. The data was crucial to efficiently scale up Cambridge’s psychometrics products so they could be used in elections and for corporate clients.","“I had left field idea,” Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote in May 2014. “What about replicating the work of the cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to facebook?” Reproducing the app, Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote, “could be a valuable leverage negotiating with the guy.”","Those negotiations failed. But Mr. Wylie struck gold with another Cambridge researcher, the Russian-American psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built his own personality quiz app for Facebook. Over subsequent months, Dr. Kogan’s work helped Cambridge develop psychological profiles of millions of American voters.","Carole Cadwalladr contributed reporting.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Spy Contractor’s Idea Helped A Firm Harvest Facebook Data.

But This One Is Different.","text":["Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal has everything: peculiar billionaires, a once-adored startup turned monolith, a political mercenary who resembles a Bond villain and his shadowy psychographic profiling firm, an eccentric whistleblower, millions of profiles worth of leaked Facebook data, Steve Bannon, the Mercers, and — crucially — Donald Trump, and the results of the 2016 presidential election.","On its face, the incident read as confirmation of many people’s worst fears — that the online platforms we live on are manipulating us, using the personal information we provided in good faith without our knowledge. Add to it that one of those many unintended outcomes could have been Donald Trump’s election and you’ve got the makings of a lasting outrage.","While the main players in the scandal — Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and Trump — will occupy headlines, they’re just the context — the perfect conditions for genuine outrage. But the Cambridge Analytica scandal isn’t really about Cambridge Analytica at all.","This is a data collection scandal. This is a scandal triggered by a specific incident, but that is broadly about the ways massive companies track us, harvest information from us, and then sell us as coercion targets in sophisticated information campaigns that could be for anything from diapers to mattresses to anti-vax literature.","The story will endure not because of animosity toward political data use but because it perfectly touches upon a deeper anxiety about our online privacy that’s been building for years. Indeed, the Cambridge Analytica scandal could well be the catalyst for a much bigger targeting revolt — a full-scale personal and public reckoning that looks at the way we’ve used the internet for the last decade. It’s a moment that forces us, collectively, to step back and think about what we sacrificed for a more convenient and connected world. And on an internet that feels increasingly toxic it’s hard to look at the tradeoffs we’ve made and feel like we’re getting a fair deal.","2. This is every place I have been in the last twelve months in Ireland, going in so far as the time of day I was in the location and how long it took me to get to that location from my previous one https://t.co/I1kB1vwntT","You can see this reckoning already begin play out across the media as the focus shifts from Cambridge Analytica’s deeds to more general concerns about privacy and the degree to which our personal lives are catalogued so that we can be targeted by anyone with a dollar (or ruble) to spend online. Over the weekend, Ars Technica reported that Facebook has long requested access to contacts, SMS data, and call history on Android devices, hiding behind a confusing opt-in page as cover.","On Twitter, Facebook users are downloading their data and combing through it to highlight various abuses of trust: that the company kept a record of private phone calls and text message data or that Facebook shared personal information with outside entities for ad purposes. Download your own Facebook, Google, and YouTube data and you'll find years’ worth of personal information: every photo, comment, sticker emoji, video you've ever posted online; every location you’ve visited and IP address you’ve logged in from; every search, every file, and every single website you visited. It's binary confirmation of something we perhaps all have silently suppressed. Every movement you make online — and even where you move about in the world — is fastidiously catalogued, analyzed, and ultimately sold.","Ok @Google. I had turned off YouTube history under my Google account settings. Today, I find out YouTube has been keeping my history for years anyway. See recent videos I watched! I track this stuff for a living. HOW THE HECK IS AN ORDINARY PERSON SUPPOSED TO MANAGE THIS? 😖😡🤬 https://t.co/NdJqEYfQIV","In the wake of this revolt, a 2010 clip of Steve Jobs talking about privacy has found new resonance in recent days. In an interview with journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, Jobs is asked to weigh in on a then-recent Facebook scandal and lays out his feelings on user privacy, as Mark Zuckerberg looks on in the audience. “Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly,” he says. “I’m an optimist; I believe people are smart, and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data.”","Today, the clip is presented as a face-to-face warning from Jobs to Zuckerberg and as proof of sorts that Facebook knew exactly what sort of surveillance tools it was building. Indeed, Facebook’s history of privacy scandals makes the current revelations feel all the more flagrant.","In 2007, Zuckerberg first apologized for its controversial Beacon ad program, which tracked purchases on outside sites and posted that information onto a user’s News Feed. “Instead of acting quickly, we took too long to decide on the right solution. I'm not proud of the way we've handled this situation and I know we can do better,” Zuckerberg wrote at the time. Three years later, in a sweat-filled interrogation at another D conference, Zuckerberg repeatedly dodged direct questions about Facebook’s cavalier attitudes toward privacy. More than 11 years after Beacon, Facebook is still behaving recklessly with our personal information and still making the same apologies — the only difference is that this time the advertising systems are far more complicated and the apologies come in full-page ads in the New York Times.","The Great Targeting Revolt isn’t just about the platforms; some in the ad industry are coming clean too. On Sunday the Verge published an editorial by a former digital marketer suggesting that Cambridge Analytica is only the tip of the iceberg. “The contemporary Internet runs on the exploitation of user data,” the author wrote, before citing examples of corporations flagrantly flaunting user privacy to extract data. It may seem obvious but the revelation is profound and the language is important. Marketing is passive but targeting is active and invasive. A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted. Cambridge Analytica, the piece argues, isn’t an outlier but the blueprint for the internet’s vast online ad economy.","A market is a place where things are bought and sold. A target is something that is hunted.","Now in its second week, the size of the scandal is still unclear. We know that data obtained by a researcher was improperly shared with political consultants and that Cambridge Analytica did not delete the data upon Facebook’s request, but there’s a whole lot we don’t know for sure. Is this sort of improper data sharing an isolated incident or is this just part of a systemic information-control problem inside Facebook? Did the data get passed around to data brokers, states, or other companies besides SCL and Cambridge Analytica? Was the specific profile data used in any way to help target voters in the 2016 election? More importantly, is this data actually as useful in persuading voters as the targeting firms would have us believe? And are the people at Cambridge Analytica the psychographic targeting evil geniuses they claim to be? Or is it all just a bunch of bullshit — less “mindfuck tool” and more midlevel marketing?","There’s evidence to suggest that the Cambridge Analytica team were, at the very least, likely overselling their influence. “When we first saw the pitch the first thought was ‘Why would I pay all this money for this stuff when I could just get our guy from Facebook to do this kind of thing for us?’” a former senior Trump campaign official told BuzzFeed News. And some researchers and psychologists are dubious about the effectiveness of the Facebook data in political ad targeting. Speaking to Wired UK, one researcher argued that psychographic profiling is light on actual science. Another professor who studied voter behavior inside Facebook between 2010 and 2015 told the publication that the Facebook data gathered through questionnaires like Cambridge Analytica’s “may not measure what you really care about” and could have actually corrupted the ad targeting data the company had previously collected.","But none of that may matter much anymore at this point. The scandal feels like a watershed moment no matter how effective Cambridge Analytica may have been. Not only has the outrage endured more than a full week of news cycles, but it seems now as if in it the Big Tech backlash has reached a critical mass, sparking an unprecedented crisis. It’s caught the eye of lawmakers across the world — Zuckerberg has been summoned by Parliament in the UK and asked to testify in Congress by multiple senators; Facebook is now under an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission about its mishandling of Cambridge Analytica data; and across the world, company executives are getting skewered by governments in nations like the UK and, worse, Singapore, where officials suggest the company has lost their trust. It’s prompted more direct talk — even from Zuckerberg himself — of regulation. Anti-monopoly advocates are calling on the FTC to restructure Facebook, suggesting a spinoff of Facebook’s ad network and even the reversal of the company’s WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions to make them competing social networks. It even appears that inside Facebook itself there’s confusion and a sense of dwindling morale. And while the blowback isn’t enough to unseat Facebook in the App Store, regular, loyal Facebook users around the world have put momentum behind a #DeleteFacebook campaign — a novel act of online rebellion despite plenty of previous privacy scandals.","Some news events unexpectedly break through and take on new lives and trigger genuine, lasting movement. Moments like these are impossible to predict or control. The Parkland school shooting this February wasn’t an outlier in terms of casualties or sheer scale of horror and yet that particular tragedy’s aftermath was a breaking point and prompted a full-throated rejection of the status quo. The Parkland students were simply fed up. Fed up with the notion of not having control over their own safety. Fed up with a system in which victims of gun violence seemingly have no agency.","While the situations are drastically different, the frustration at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica scandal is similarly about agency and control. For years we’ve read about privacy scandals from the NSA’s Prism program to the data breaches everywhere from Equifax to Ashley Madison. We’re no stranger to the warnings that the platforms we live on harvest our data and that every detail of our online activities acts as the oil that powers the internet’s economic engine and that there’s little we can do, save for opting out completely. But this one lays bare the downsides of this tradeoff — how, despite their pledge to empower us, the platforms we live on have done just the opposite and stripped us of the agency to dictate what happens with our most personal information. Maybe it’s because Facebook feels so personal or because the 2016 election was so divisive, but this scandal is shaping up to be the event that forces the scales to fall from our eyes. We’ve lost control. And we’re fed up.","Every revolution needs to be ignited. Cambridge Analytica feels a lot like a spark.","If you want to read more about Facebook’s data scandal,subscribe to Infowarzel, a BuzzFeed News newsletter by the author of this piece, Charlie Warzel.","Charlie Warzel is a Senior Technology Writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in Missoula, Montana"],"isopubdate":""}

And I Sorely Regret It. - The New York Times","text":["I Voted for Trump. And I Sorely Regret It.","When Donald Trump first announced his presidential campaign, I, like most people, thought it would be a short-lived publicity stunt. A month later, though, I happened to catch one of his political rallies on C-Span. I was riveted.","I supported the Republican in dozens of articles, radio and TV appearances, even as conservative friends and colleagues said I had to be kidding. As early as September 2015, I wrote that Mr. Trump was “the most serious candidate in the race.” Critics of the pro-Trump blog and then the nonprofit journal that I founded accused us of attempting to “understand Trump better than he understands himself.” I hoped that was the case. I saw the decline in this country — its weak economy and frayed social fabric — and I thought Mr. Trump’s willingness to move past partisan stalemates could begin a process of renewal.","It is now clear that my optimism was unfounded. I can’t stand by this disgraceful administration any longer, and I would urge anyone who once supported him as I did to stop defending the 45th president.","Far from making America great again, Mr. Trump has betrayed the foundations of our common citizenship. And his actions are jeopardizing any prospect of enacting an agenda that might restore the promise of American life.","***","What, you may wonder, especially in the wake of Charlottesville, Va., did I possibly see in this candidate?","Although crude and meandering for almost all of the primary campaign, Mr. Trump eschewed strict ideologies and directly addressed themes that the more conventional candidates of both parties preferred to ignore. Rather than recite paeans to American enterprise, he acknowledged that our “information economy” has delivered little wage or productivity growth. He was willing to criticize the bipartisan consensus on trade and pointed out the devastating effects of deindustrialization felt in many communities. He forthrightly addressed the foreign policy failures of both parties, such as the debacles in Iraq and Libya, and rejected the utopian rhetoric of “democracy promotion.” He talked about the issue of widening income inequality — almost unheard of for a Republican candidate — and didn’t pretend that simply cutting taxes or shrinking government would solve the problem.","Image","Julius KreinCreditBenjamin Norman for The New York Times","He criticized corporations for offshoring jobs, attacked financial-industry executives for avoiding taxes and bemoaned America’s reliance on economic bubbles over the last few decades. He blasted the Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz campaigns for insincerely mouthing focus-grouped platitudes while catering to their largest donors — and he was right. Voters loved that he was willing to buck conventional wisdom and the establishment.","He flouted G.O.P. orthodoxy on entitlements, infrastructure spending and, at times, even health care and “culture war” issues like funding Planned Parenthood. His statements on immigration were often needlessly inflammatory, but he correctly diagnosed that our current system makes little sense for most Americans, as well as many immigrants, and seems designed to benefit the wealthy at the expense of working people.","Yes, Mr. Trump’s policy positions were poorly defined, but these days, most candidates’ positions are. And yes, he had little support from the Republican Party leadership. But many of us thought even this might be a positive if it forced him to focus on “making deals” rather than on Washington’s usual ideological posturing. He was never going to fulfill all of his over-the-top promises, but we believed that his administration might achieve some meaningful successes.","In my writing, I tried to steer this administration in the right direction. During the presidential primaries, the blog I helped organize, called the Journal of American Greatness, was one of the leading voices supporting certain themes of Trump’s campaign. (Michael Anton, now a National Security Council adviser, was our most prolific writer.) Then, after the election, I founded a quarterly journal, American Affairs, largely to question elements of what is often called the neoliberal policy consensus — totally open borders for capital and labor; transferring power from national governments to transnational technocracies; unfettered markets; and democracy promotion as the sole premise of foreign policy. In other words, the disappointing legacy we inherited from the Bushes and the Clintons that helped pave the way to Mr. Trump’s election.","In this role, as one of the few people in the media who has been somewhat sympathetic to Mr. Trump, I am often asked to comment on his surprise victory, or more recently on his statements, policies and the gusher of news pouring out of this White House. For months, despite increasing chaos and incoherence, I have given Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt: “No, I don’t really think he is a racist,” I have told skeptical audiences. “Yes, he says some stupid things, but none of it really matters; he’s not really that incompetent.” Or: “They’ve made some mistakes, but it’s still early.”","It’s no longer early. Not only has the president failed to make the course corrections necessary to save his administration, but his increasingly appalling conduct will continue to repel anyone who might once have been inclined to work with him.","From the very start of his run, one of the most serious charges against Mr. Trump was that he panders to racists. Many of his supporters, myself included, managed to convince ourselves that his more outrageous comments — such as the Judge Gonzalo Curiel controversy or his initial hesitance to disavow David Duke’s endorsement — were merely Bidenesque gaffes committed during the heat of a campaign.","It is now clear that we were deluding ourselves. Either Mr. Trump is genuinely sympathetic to the David Duke types, or he is so obtuse as to be utterly incapable of learning from his worst mistakes. Either way, he continues to prove his harshest critics right.","Mr. Trump once boasted that he could shoot someone in the street and not lose voters. Well, someone was just killed in the street by a white supremacist in Charlottesville. His refusal this weekend to specifically and immediately denounce the groups responsible for this intolerable violence was both morally disgusting and monumentally stupid. In this, Mr. Trump failed perhaps the easiest imaginable test of presidential leadership. Rather than advance a vision of national unity that he claims to represent, his indefensible equivocation can only inflame the most vicious forces of division within our country.","If Mr. Trump had been speaking about the overall political climate, he might have been right to say that “many sides” are responsible for exacerbating social tensions. Yet during the events in Charlottesville this past weekend, only one side — a deranged white nationalist — was responsible for killing anyone. To equivocate about this fact is the height of irresponsibility. Even those concerned about the overzealous enforcement of political correctness can hardly think that apologizing for neo-Nazis is a sensible alternative.","Those of us who supported Mr. Trump were never so naïve as to expect that he would transform himself into a model of presidential decorum upon taking office. But our calculation was that a few cringe-inducing tweets were an acceptable trade-off for a successful governing agenda.","Yet after more than 200 days in office, Mr. Trump’s behavior grows only more reprehensible. Meanwhile, his administration has no significant legislative accomplishments — and no apparent plan to deliver any. Wilbur Ross’s Commerce Department has advanced some sensible and appropriately incremental changes to trade policy, but no long-term agenda has been articulated. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue’s recently proposed legislation offers a sound basis for reforming immigration policy, but seems to have no prospects and has received comparatively little attention. The administration inexplicably downgraded infrastructure and corporate tax reform — issues with potentially broad-based support — to pursue a warmed-over version of Paul Ryan’s Obamacare repeal, which ended, predictably, in a humiliating failure.","Nothing disastrous has occurred on the foreign policy front — yet — but the never-ending chaos within the administration hardly inspires confidence. Many senior-level appointees are still not in place, including the assistant secretaries of state, for example. And too many of those who are in office appear to be petty, clueless, and rather repulsive ideologues, like former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who seem to spend most of their time accusing one another of being “swamp creatures.” It’s pathetic. No wonder an increasing number of officials are simply ignoring the president, an alarming but understandable development. The firing of Mr. Bannon is an indication that Mr. Trump is beginning to recognize his blunders, but people like me have forgiven him too many times already.","Effectively a third-party president without a party, Mr. Trump has faced extraordinary resistance from the media, the bureaucracy and even within the Republican Party. But the administration has committed too many unforced errors and deserves most of the blame for its failures. Far from making the transformative “deals” he promised voters, his only talent appears to be creating grotesque media frenzies — just as all his critics said.","Those who found some admirable things in the hazy outlines of Mr. Trump’s campaign — a trade policy focused on national industrial development; a less quixotic foreign policy; less ideological approaches to infrastructure, health care and entitlements — will have to salvage that agenda from the wreckage of his presidency. On that, I’m not ready to give up.","This story has been updated to reflect news events.","Julius Krein (@JuliusKrein) is the founder and editor of American Affairs."],"isopubdate":"2018-08-07"}

Facebook believes shutting that system down “will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook,” Graham Mudd, product marketing director at Facebook, said in a post Wednesday.","​In addition, Facebook is halting its practice of providing anonymized data from its platform to such information brokers that they use to measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns, said people familiar with the matter. But the company is trying to find more secure ways to share data with these brokers to measure ad performance, one of the people said, at a time when advertisers are clamoring for data that proves that Facebook ads work.","Facebook is making the changes as part of a broader internal review of how it handles user information. The company is reviewing its relationship with data brokers in part because it is concerned about how those firms are obtaining their data and how accurate it is, one of the people said.","Late Wednesday, Acxiom confirmed Facebook had informed it of plans to end Partner Categories, which Acxiom estimated will reduce its fiscal 2019 revenue and profit by as much as $25 million. Acxiom’s brief statement didn’t give a reason for Facebook’s decision.","“Today, more than ever, it is important for businesses to be able to rely upon companies that understand the critical importance of ethically sourced data and strong data governance,” Acxiom CEO Scott Howe said. “These are among Acxiom’s core strengths.”","Oracle declined to comment.","Facebook's current data crisis involving Cambridge Analytica has angered users and prompted government investigations. To understand what's happening now, you have to look back at Facebook's old policies from 2007 to 2014. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains. Illustration: Laura Kammerman","Facebook has battled criticism over its user-data practices since it said on March 16 that personal information was improperly obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics firm that worked for the 2016 Trump campaign.","Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized last week for a “major breach of trust” in that episode and outlined steps the company has taken and plans to take to better protect user data. On Wednesday, the company also announced measures to make it simpler for users to examine and change some of the data about them that the social network tracks.","Curbing its relationships with data brokers could affect Facebook’s value proposition to advertisers, removing a layer of information that has helped some marketers target ads with greater precision. But the impact is likely to be limited, industry executives said.","Facebook’s partnership with data providers has particularly helped brands that lacked detailed customer data, such as consumer packaged-goods makers, said Lance Neuhauser, CEO of 4C Insights, a digital-ad service provider. However, he said, advances in Facebook’s own targeting capabilities have “made the need for some of this third party targeting a little less important.”","Facebook and other internet companies also are under pressure from European Union authorities to make sure all of its targeting data is collected with user permission, as part of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation scheduled to take effect in May. Verifying that could be difficult with data from brokers, Mr. Neuhauser said.","In a memo to advertising agencies, Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president of global marketing solutions, said the data-broker relationships would be phased out in six months. Advertisers can still target audiences on Facebook but they must use “data that they have the rights, permissions, and lawful basis to use,” she said. “We understand this may impact your clients advertising efforts on our platform, and we will work with you through this transition.”","While Facebook has a huge amount of data on users—sites they’ve liked, their interests and detailed demographic information, even their chat history—brokers such as Acxiom, Oracle Data Cloud, and\nEpsilon Data Management\nLLC have reams of information on people’s purchases, household income and other characteristics.","That information is matched to Facebook profiles, allowing brands to target ads at people who have bought certain products—and extend those campaigns to Facebook users with similar characteristics. These relationships helped Facebook beef up its ad-targeting capabilities in recent years, former employees say.","The extent of the possible impact on Facebook of removing third-party data isn’t clear. The company’s trove of data is hugely valuable on its own. And many marketers have their own consumer data that they upload to Facebook and use in ad campaigns—a practice not affected by the new changes.","Still, some big ad categories will be hampered. “This will be brutal for advertisers” that do not have first party data on their customers such as consumer product companies who depend heavily on the information from third party data firms, said one ad buyer. The move also could affect auto advertisers who use things such as data that identifies people in the market shopping for a new car, said another ad buyer.","The change also is a blow to the data companies. Shares in Conway, Ark.-based Acxiom, which has had a relationship with Facebook since 2013, fell 8.4% in trading Wednesday, before Facebook’s plans were disclosed, and dropped nearly 11% more in after-hours trading.","The data companies vacuum up consumer information from a variety of sources, including public records and transactions with retailers. They are able to build profiles detailing everything from people’s grocery store purchases to the cars they own to their magazine subscriptions. Much of this activity is done without the knowledge of consumers.","A 2014 report by the Federal Trade Commission found that data brokers collect and store data on nearly every U.S. consumer, and that one company alone added more than three billion new data points to its database each month. The report recommended more transparency in the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

So my own view is it was much more than 50M.”","We’ve reached out to Facebook about Wylie’s claim — but at the time of writing the company had not provided a response.","“There were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,” Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says users’ data was obtained by CA. “It first started as a very small pilot — firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral register… We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallife deployed via Facebook’s platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014.","“That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.”","The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie.","“This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.”","Facebook has previously confirmed 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it.","Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing.","Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reported that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform.","In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak.","It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes. EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that.","“There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.”","Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, Facebook settled with the FTC over charges it had deceived users by “telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public”.","And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal.","Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.","When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data.","The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data”. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it has also tweeted re: the GSR data.","(Following the session, CA has also now put out a longer response statement, refuting multiple parts of Wylie’s testimony and claiming he has “misrepresented himself and the company”. In this it also claims: “Cambridge Analytica does not hold any GSR data or any data derived from GSR data. We have never shared the GSR data with Aggregate IQ [another alleged affiliate company], Palantir or any other entity. Cambridge Analytica did not use any GSR data in the work that we did for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.”)","Asked by the committee about Nix’s earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”.","“That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data.","Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered.","Kogan also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”.","Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it sought to predict via patterns in the data.","He said:","For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC. And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like.","“That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.”","Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later.","“The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data”","Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms.","Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.”","The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions.","“That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Wylie added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.”","Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.”","The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns.","Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used.","“Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.”","In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: “The source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property.”","Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA.","“It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore.","“But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].”","The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”.","During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform.","“He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted?","“It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.”","We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either.","Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge. They certainly didn’t with me — until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no I’ve actually given over everything to the authorities.”","“I suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016… they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,” he said. “So I don’t think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach that’s going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data,” he added. “It was everywhere.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

{"originalurl":"https://techindc.com/2018/03/28/mark-zuckerberg-gdpr/","title":"We must share responsibility with Mark Zuckerberg, and the US must copy GDPR - Tech in DC","text":["We must share responsibility with Mark Zuckerberg, and the US must copy GDPR","The pitch of the discussion surrounding Mark Zuckerberg in the jet-wash of the Cambridge Analytica revelations begs attention in and of itself. The reaction doesn’t seem proportional to the potency of the situation but speaks to something more deep-rooted. This is not just a question about Facebook; engaging in a who-can-be-more-angry-at-Zuck competition risks missing the broader and more important question pertaining to our relationship with our data.","If we were to try and identify the single moment where an erroneous decision was made, it would be one of two points. The first might be the decision to allow app developers access to user’s friend’s data, which is actually not the bit which Zuckerberg apologised for, though he did admit to being too idealistic about the good vs bad creations which would transpire from that decision. The second would be to not follow up with Cambridge Analytica, who signed a legal confirmation that they never had access to user’s friends Facebook data, and had deleted any derivative data from their servers, which Zuckerberg did apologise for.","To deal with the second point quickly, I’ll stick my neck out and say having sought legal confirmation Facebook had fulfilled due diligence on the matter. They were lied to by allegedly nefarious actors, and so are arguably victims of Cambridge Analytica’s actions. I don’t think many of us in that situation would have decided to engage in a legal battle to send auditors to a company then not know to be anything more than a small data analytics company on the off chance they might be lying.","To the first point, none of the journalists who managed to get an interview with Zuckerberg have asked exactly what user’s friend’s data was made available through the app connection. Was it just the number of friends? Their location? Their demographic data? Equally there seems to be no reporting on whether we, as users, agreed to this data use in the terms and conditions we all accept without reading. The reason, one suspects, is because everyone was primed to be angry at Facebook and only sought enough information to justify that anger. Once a justification was landed on it was considered the finish line of reporting.","Our responsibility","Every time Facebook gets in trouble over data there are two elephants in the room. Firstly, it’s worth noting that the media like to get very angry with Facebook, because it’s one of the companies that has made life very difficult for them over the last decade or so. Facebook is one of the reasons there is no more ‘proper journalism’ especially given the recent News Feed updates. The second much bigger elephant was entertainingly reported by Reply Alllast November. The presenters decided to find out how much is behind the assertion that many suspect Facebook is using the mic on our phones to listen in to our conversations and advertise to us.","What they found out is that Facebook already has enough data on us, without hijacking our microphones, to target advertisements very accurately. What became clear during the episode, as the presenters spoke to users, is that none of us realise how much data we’ve willingly given up to Facebook. To the point where those they spoke to, who believed Facebook was using their microphones, are so firm in their belief they can’t be convinced otherwise. At the end of last week I took a quick poll in the office of how many apps people had granted access to their Facebook profile through Facebook Connect (logging in to other sites using Facebook). Of the 17 who responded nearly half had given access to more than 80 apps, and many were surprised at how many. The highest was 205 – the COO confidently told me before checking that his would number around 20, he found out it was 113. There was only one person who had not granted access to any apps. I had given 131 apps access and after a purge managed to get it down to 65.","In addition, how many of us are aware of Facebook Pixel and its capabilities – their tag which they can insert on other websites (like the New York Times, The Guardian, The Observer, Wired and Recode) which collects data from your use of those sites and sends it back to Facebook? If you’re logged in to any of these sites at the same time as being logged in to Facebook it can send your data back to Facebook linked to your profile. The publications which broke the Cambridge Analytica story are part of Facebook’s data collection machine, and though many websites do this and have some fairly ambiguous terms and conditions referring to it, it’s a functionality – one suspects – which would be unacceptable in many other walks of life. And simply sticking something in the Ts & Cs can’t be the solution to everything.","Through incremental improvements, what Facebook and others have done, is build a Sherlock Holmes data collection and processing engine which can make accurate deductions about what you might want to purchase. We’ve agreed to hand over a creepy amount of data and while we might want to argue that Facebook should have made that clearer, we can’t ignore the fact that we did agree to it (or at least most of it). The fact that Facebook was also scraping call and text data from Android phones is further proof that this is a general issue, since Google must take their share of responsibility as well.","We also have to admit how much we love Facebook. Of course, we could #deletefacebook, but the vast majority of us don’t want to because we enjoy it. Part of the reason we’re so angry at Zuckerberg is because the solution isn’t as simple as not using the platform anymore; most of us consider a display of indignation at Zuckerberg, such that he fixes the situation, preferable to deleting our account.","To further deflate the situation, we already have the answer to the problem. Zuckerberg should, out of respect to the jurisdictions he operates in, appear before US Congress and UK Parliament to answer questions. The former he’s agreed to, the latter he’s declined. Which shows a clear lack of respect for the notion that Facebook is a global company. But we don’t need some long period of rumination to figure out what to do here, the EU will be implementing GDPR in May and it contains all the legislation we need to provide a regulatory framework to be able to deal with a situation like this in future. The core of GDPR is worth committing to memory:","Breach Notifications – Any data breach must be reported to users within 72 hours if it is likely to “result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals”.","Right to Access – All users have a right to which of their data are being process, where and for what purpose. Companies must provide on request a free copy of this information in digital form.","Right to be Forgotten – Companies must delete any data, draw a stop to its dissemination and halt third party processing upon user request. This also applies to any data no longer relevant to its original purpose.","Data Portability – Companies must provide user data in a commonly used and “machine readable” format should users want to switch services.","Privacy by Design – Companies must build their systems to be secure from the ground up (as opposed to add security features on as afterthoughts). This also involves “data minimisation” which means companies cannot hold any more data than are required for the processing of its duties.","Number 1., 3. and 5. would all have been relevant to the Facebook case and would provide clear legislation under which Facebook, Google and Cambridge Analytica could have been held to account.","Credit where progress is due","To say a kind word about Mark Zuckerberg is not the done thing right now. I have my criticism of Facebook, that their advertising model and product have become too blended, that Zuckerberg has not developed a product vision which reconciles the need to generate revenue, but has rather unwittingly exploited his own product to generate revenue. Which is part of the reason we are where we are now.","Facebook need to go back to their core product and draw a line around the areas where the advertising model can operate, and which leaves the majority of the product to be enjoyed in and of itself. Part of the reason people are so angry with him seems to be because their dissatisfaction with Facebook has been building for some time, they’ve watched the advertising model creep into their social media platform more and more to the point where the product they once loved has become overrun with creepy ad-algorithms. I don’t know at this point whether I’d refer to Facebook as a social media company or a data advertising company. They need to go back to their roots and find a way to earn sustainable revenue.","But, equally, this serves as a wake-up call to all of us who use any such platform. We protested too late, despite the hallmarks being perfectly apparent.","That being said, Zuckerberg has previously promised to double his platform’s safety and security team from 10,000 to 20,000, such an increase that he had to warn Wall St that it would dent profit. And since the Cambridge Analytica story has broken he has displayed a willingness to testify before Congress, has offered to pay to audit all of Facebook’s apps (to the point where they wondered whether there were enough auditors in the world), and apologised fairly emphatically. The last time UK newspaper advertising space was taken up by an apology it was from Rupert Murdoch following the phone-hacking scandal. The headline of the advert was a simple “We are sorry” – compare this to Facebook’s “We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it”.","All in all, I would argue that Zuckerberg has reacted as one might hope a CEO in hot water might react. And we should be careful, as a society, not to go after to him too hard lest we create a future situation where CEOs presiding over a tough situation, whether it’s their fault or not, think “well look what happened to Zuck, I’m going to get torn apart anyway so I might as well try and cover it up”.","Ben Allen is a traveller, a millennial and a Brit.

{"originalurl":"http://www.indiatides.com/user-data-leaks-at-facebook-pull-tech-further-into-political-debate/","title":"User data leaks at Facebook pull tech further into political debate - India Tides","text":["User data leaks at Facebook pull tech further into political debate","Facebook said on Thursday it had suspended a data analytics firm associated with the Trump campaign, but may have indeed greatly downplayed the scale of the data that firm actually had access to, according to a new report inÂ The New York Times.","Cambridge Analytica had worked withÂ University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, who had developed an app called â€œthisisyourdigitallifeâ€ and obtained user information â€” which theÂ Times is reporting scooped up information on profiles of as many as 50 million users.Â Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to usersâ€™ geographic information. But just one person â€” with hundreds of friends â€” allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, itâ€™s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasnâ€™t a breach â€” though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, hereâ€™s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update:Â Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Hereâ€™s his explanation.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","I’m going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data thatâ€™s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was â€œcontroversialâ€ with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trumpâ€™s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on theÂ right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwupsÂ and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, itâ€™s hardly alone in that respect. Weâ€™ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uberâ€™s â€œgod viewâ€ and Lyftâ€™s own troubles. Itâ€™s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort.Â Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It doesÂ not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account ofÂ Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and â€œquestioned whether any data still remained out of its controlsâ€ throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so weâ€™ll take that as the current statement for Facebook.","Facebook announced late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories, and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica â€” which used Facebook data to target voters for President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign in the 2016 election. In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the companyâ€™s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to â€œthe public prominence of this organization.â€","Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called â€œthisisyourdigitallifeâ€ that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of â€œa research app used by psychologists.â€","Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to usersâ€™ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about usersâ€™ friends. While Koganâ€™s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebookâ€™s policies, â€œhe did not subsequently abide by our rules,â€ Grewal stated in the Facebook post.","â€œBy passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.â€","Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action â€” apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information.","Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica eitherÂ played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential electionÂ or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analyticaâ€™s so-called secret sauce as â€œexaggeratedâ€ in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analyticaâ€™s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaksâ€™ Julian Assange with an offer to helpÂ disseminate Hillary Clintonâ€™s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","â€¦We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trumpâ€™s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didnâ€™t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (itâ€™s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as Iâ€™ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly thereâ€™s psychographic data thatâ€™s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because weâ€™re not reinventing the wheel. [Weâ€™ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and weâ€™ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didnâ€™t have time. We just couldnâ€™t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebookâ€™s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadnâ€™t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","â€œThereâ€™s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,â€ Nix told TechCrunch last year. â€œâ€¦There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which weâ€™re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.â€","Responding to the allegations, Cambridge Analytica sent the following statement.","In 2014, SCL Elections contracted Dr. Kogan via his company Global Science Research (GSR) to undertake a large scale research project in the US. GSR was contractually committed to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR were also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. The language in the SCL Elections contract with GSR is explicit on these points. GSR subsequently obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebookâ€™s terms of service, SCL Elections deleted all data it had received from GSR. For the avoidance of doubt, no data from GSR was used in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election.","Under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act (Unlawful obtaining etc. of personal data), a criminal offense has not been committed if a person has acted in the reasonable belief that he had in law the right to obtain data. GSR was a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding the its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections. It would be entirely incorrect to attempt to claim that SCL Elections","illegally acquired Facebook data. Indeed SCL Elections worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that SCL Elections had not knowingly breached any of Facebookâ€™s Terms of Service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data.","A few weeks ago I met with, and interviewed, Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica. His company has been credited with helping Donald Trump win the U.S. presidency. Itâ€™s also been associated with many other controversial political campaigns globally and accused by some of aiding the U.K.â€™s exit from the EU. He addresses all of these subjects in detail (a shorter summary is here).","The interview, which was recorded, was conducted in private at the IT Arena conference in Lviv, Ukraine.","This is the transcript of the interview, which was 50 minutes long:","Mike Butcher (MB):You think that digital advertising agencies have â€˜got it comingâ€™, such as the WPPs of this world. What do you mean by that?","Alexander Nix (Nix):Actually, probably not digital advertising agencies because theyâ€™re more progressive. Iâ€™m really looking at the old school traditional creative-led agencies. [For example] within WPP, obviously Martin (Sorrell) has made a huge effort to pivot his business. Heâ€™s making a huge effort every day, acquiring 40+ companies a year, something like that. But when you look at the traditional approach to advertising, which is fundamentally driven by guesswork, albeit very intuitive and experienced guessworkâ€¦ The advert I was thinking aboutâ€¦ do you remember the Cadburyâ€™s advert of a gorilla playing the drums? I mean who could have known that that was going to be a national success? I mean, youâ€™re telling me they went and opinion-surveyed 5,000 people and then decided to make a gorilla advert? Of course they didnâ€™t! They just â€˜wingâ€™d itâ€™ and it happened to push peopleâ€™s buttons and it was a great success. Well, that sort of advertising is going to be replaced by highly targeted, very personalized advertising, and that has to be data-driven. Thatâ€™s not replacing of creativity, thatâ€™s using data to augment creativity. Data first then creativity. Itâ€™s linear.","MB:Looking at the figures on your website you said you drove 1.5% increase in favourability among people who saw your [US election campaign] ads. Not everyone who becomes more favourable after seeing that ad is going to change their vote for instance. Most of them had been planning to vote for Trump already or [the ad] wouldnâ€™t make enough difference to stop them voting for Hillary. But it might for influence a very small percentage of the electorate. That might have been enough to swing Michigan but not the whole election.","Nix:How many states was the election won over? Four? I mean, winning Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Floridaâ€¦ That was pretty much it.","MB:Because it came down the electoral college that you were targeting?","Nix:It always comes down to that. Itâ€™s always the roadmap to 270. That changes every day. You go in to the election: â€œWeâ€™re thinking okay these are 12-14 battleground states.â€ After six weeks youâ€™re like: â€œChrist. That oneâ€™s dead. Got to move. How do how do we get there how do we do the sums to get back to where we want to be?â€ You know, you donâ€™t need to and you canâ€™t afford to focus on 50 states. Youâ€™re looking atâ€¦ you know youâ€™re going to win these ones youâ€™re never going to win those, so how do you get to where you want to go?","MB:You said the people who saw Cambridge Analytica advertsâ€¦ they likelihood of voting for Trump increased by 1 percent. Isnâ€™t it that one of the companyâ€™s claims?","Nix:Googleâ€™s study was based on the impact of our digital campaign. It said [there was an ] 11.3 percent increase in favourability for Trump. An 8.3 percent increase in intent to vote for Trump. These are significant numbers.","MB:So in 2017 you can claim you have psychological profiles of 220m U.S. citizens based on five thousand separate data sets?","Nix:It actually works slightly different to that. We went out and we started to rollout a long form quantitive survey to probeâ€™s psychographics.","So we had hundreds of thousands of Americans fill out this survey. Completely independent from that we went and collected hundreds and then thousands of data points on every adult 230 million Americans.","MB:This was publicly available data?","Nix:This is publicly available data, this is client data, this is an aggregated third-party data. All sorts of data. In fact, weâ€™re always acquiring more. Every day we have teams looking for new data sets.","Letâ€™s say based on the personality survey that weâ€™ve identified five personality types, only, for the whole of America. And letâ€™s say for each personality type weâ€™ve got a hundred thousand people of type A and Type B and Type C. Well, weâ€™ll look at the hundred thousand type A personalities, and then weâ€™ll have a look at the corresponding data points that we have on those hundred thousand people. Weâ€™ll have a look at what attributes they have in common and then weâ€™ll build a model based on that. So if we identify that all type A personalities drive a lemon yellow car and wear Wellington boots and have a dog and three children and whatever, we can then make a prediction about everyone else in the universe who has a yellow car, a dog, Wellington boots and say well theyâ€™re very likely to also have a type A personality based on their data.","The best example I can give you [of] building a model [is that] in England we have a stereotype for conservatives, rural conservatives. They wear a barber [jacket], that Nigel Farage type. They wear a Barber and Wellington boots and have a Labrador, and they all went to private school, and they are therefore going to vote Tory. A stereotype but stereotypes are based on something. Well, that was four data points. Actually, itâ€™s quite accurate in England. Imagine if you had 40 data points, or 400 and you extrapolated that they drive Land Rover, they like shooting, they both work in merchant banking and so on. You start to build up those data points and you can very accurately say â€œWell, I donâ€™t know this personâ€™s party political affiliation, but I do know they have a Barber and a Land Rover and a dog and they like shooting and work in merchant banking, therefore, theyâ€™re likely to be a Tory.","MB:So you call this psychographics?","Nix:Yes.","MB:But did you use psychographics in the Trump campaign or didnâ€™t you?","Nix:No, we didnâ€™t. Weâ€™ve been absolutely, incredibly clear about this. We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trumpâ€™s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didnâ€™t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (itâ€™s probably why he went bust).

But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didnâ€™t have time. We just couldnâ€™t do that.","MB:You say youâ€™ve been building this data since the late 90s. We know Facebookâ€™s terms of service in 2006 were quite different to what they are now. And actually there was quite a lot of data â€” scrape is probably too blunt a word â€” but data which you could pull out of Facebook then that you canâ€™t pull out now. Was it the case that you had huge data sets on these people before the door started to close on the [Facebook] terms of service?","Nix:Well, actually let me correct you. The company started in the early 90s or late 80s. We were a behavioural science company. We didnâ€™t pivot into data analytics till 2012. So, all the data that we collected pre-2012, which was done by the British company SBL group, was collected through quantitive and qualitative research on the ground. Our modus operandi was to go and speak to, say, 100,000 people and start to use that to build on models.","MB:Speak to them how? Via call centre surveys?","Nix:Depending on the countryâ€¦ I mean, in America, yes, call centres, the Internet where possible, face to faceâ€¦ But in a country like Nigeria you know you just have teams and teams of students going out there knocking on doors.","MB:So youâ€™re doing that in Nigeria?","Nix:Well, weâ€™ve been doing that since our first election was 1994 for Mandela/ANC and since then weâ€™ve done multiple elections every year.","MB:Another claim CA makes is that you raised nearly $27m for Trump from 950,000 email addresses?","Nix:No those are two separate things. We ran a â€˜small-dollarâ€™ fundraising program. So what we did was we used our data to identify core Trump supporters. These are the diehard Trump supporters of which we estimate there are about 37-38 million people in America. And we then targeted them with a with a donor solicitation or small dollars solicitation campaign to ask them to send donations in. And we built all the data and all the mechanisms to do that. We raised that $27m within the first month of starting work. In total, obviously, that program went on to raise hundreds and millions of dollars.","MB:Would you consider that to be being pivotal for their campaign?","Nix:Well I think I think it was extremely pivotal because when Trump won the nomination he had very, very little money. And although he talked about putting a bit of money in himself, and he did put some money and some in as cash, most of it as loans, thatâ€™s my understanding, you know, you were competing against the machine and she had dollars coming out of everywhere.","Also there was a huge â€œNever Trumpâ€ faction in America. Most of the Republicans didnâ€™t support him, and even those who ended up working for him didnâ€™t support him. So the RNC, the Republican National Committee, didnâ€™t support him. Ultimately they pivoted. A lot of the key RNC members were part of the â€œNever Trumpâ€ faction. They were behind his back. They were trying to destroy him. And eventually they all they did a complete U-turn. Part of the reason why we were thrust into such a prominent role in this campaign is because none of the vendors would support him.","[Being among] Republican venderâ€™s is an incredibly hostile environment. They were looking at this candidate and they said â€œWell, first and foremost we donâ€™t like him.â€ A typical presidential campaign will probably have five or eight different companies support it. Youâ€™ll have a pollster, youâ€™ll have a digital agency, youâ€™ll have a TV agency, youâ€™ll have a research firm. And then the campaign manager and the campaign committee will choose the best pollsters and the best thing or their best friend or however they figure these things out.","Well, Trump won the nomination and all the Republicans said â€œWell, heâ€™s going to get murdered by Hillary. If we work for him, the establishment of the RNC is going to hate us. Weâ€™ll never get another dollar in U.S. politics again. So weâ€™ll make a quick buck today, but itâ€™s going to kill our career tomorrow.â€ So a lot of them are like â€œweâ€™d never want to touch this.â€ So rather than having multiple vendors servicing his campaign, as is traditional, as Hillary had, we walked in there and said â€œWeâ€™ll do your data analytics.â€ And they were like: â€œThereâ€™s no one doing research.â€ [We said] we will do your research. â€œThereâ€™s no doing digitalâ€ We will do digital. â€œThereâ€™s no one doing TV.â€ â€œWeâ€™ll do your TV.â€ Weâ€™ll do your donations. And so overnight it went from being originally just data, to end to end.","MB:Did you believe you were betting farm, as it were, on the campaign?","Nix:Look, from my perspective it was an easy bet to make. It was a win-win. I couldnâ€™t see the downside. I thought even if Trump didnâ€™t prevail, if he didnâ€™t win the election.Look, weâ€™re a British firm that was trying to break into the most competitive political market in the world. And you know, we had some mixed press. But what really irritates me is when journalists go to get a quote about our work. And someone says â€œWe worked with Cambridge Analytica and their work didnâ€™t really provide anything. It was rubbish.â€ And then you have a look at who the quote was from and itâ€™s from a direct competitor!","And this is what the journalists havenâ€™t quite figured out. A lot of the people that they speak to are people whose lunch weâ€™re eating. We walked into [the US] market. Weâ€™re competing with all the data teams. Weâ€™re competing with all the digital teams, all the TV teams, all the research teams. Youâ€™ve seen House of Cards. Itâ€™s like that. Itâ€™s the most vicious aggressive political culture both at the candidate level, that Trump is now finding out. At the campaign manager, GC level and at the vendor level. Itâ€™s a bloodbath. The knivesâ€¦ [are out]. In DC, everyoneâ€™s fucking everyone else.","You see three quotes theyâ€™re all from people whose business youâ€™ve stolen. Theyâ€™re saying things like we came across â€œCambridge Analytica. Itâ€™s All snake oilâ€ [and itâ€™s from] our biggest rival.","MB:Do you think thereâ€™s a mischaracterization of the tools used by targeted advertising campaigns, or so-called â€˜custom audienceâ€™ campaigns, as being described as â€œdark advertisingâ€ campaigns?","Nix:Thereâ€™s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world. And there are some things that I would definitely [say] Iâ€™m very proud of that weâ€™re doing which are innovative. And there are some things which is best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which weâ€™re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.","Advertising agencies are using some of these techniques on a national scale. For us itâ€™s been very refreshing, really breaking into the commercial and brand spaceâ€¦ walking into a campaign where youâ€™re basically trying to educate the market on stuff they simply donâ€™t understand. You walk into a sophisticated brand or into an advertising agency, and the conversation [is sophisticated] You go straight down to: â€œAh, so youâ€™re doing a programmatic campaign, you can augment that with some linear optimized dataâ€¦ they understand it.â€ They know itâ€™s their world, and now it comes down to the nuances. â€œSo what exactly are you doing thatâ€™s going to be a bit more effective and give us an extra 3 percent or 4 percent there.â€ Itâ€™s a delight. You know these are professionals who really get this world and thatâ€™s where we want to be operating.","MB:Do you regret the way your own business is being presented in the media?","Nix:If thereâ€™s any testament to whatâ€™s driving the media just have a glance at Hillary Clintonâ€™s recent book. The liberal press are supporting their candidate. They got fairly beaten and theyâ€™re lashing out and trying to destroy every single person and every company that contributed to that defeat. Hillary simply cannot come to terms with it. Sheâ€™s a woman in denial. The liberal press [characterised Cambridge Analytica] as â€œwitchcraft, they treat it is â€œvoodooâ€ and now itâ€™s Russiaâ€™s fault! They just cannot accept the fact that Hillary was such an unpopular, such a divisive candidate. She failed to mobilize her base and people didnâ€™t fundamentally trust her. Rather than looking in the mirror, they much prefer to beat up Cambridge [Analytica] beat up Trump, beat up anyone else. Anything but accept the fact that their candidate wasnâ€™t what the people wanted to vote for.","MB:Would you would use your own methods to improve your own public image?A marketing campaign for yourself to create a better image for your own company?","Nix:Would we rollout a national behavioural micro-targeting program to promote Cambridge Analytica? It probably wouldnâ€™t really achieve what weâ€™re trying to do. I mean actually Iâ€™m just â€˜dotting the Iâ€™s and crossing the Tâ€™sâ€™ on a book which talks about our methodology and our approach to communications and I was speaking to the publisher about whether we should might target that. Itâ€™s a book hasnâ€™t been published yet, itâ€™ll come out next month, just talking really in quite technical terms about how communication is changing, what how technology is impacting that, what data is doing to advertising and political campaigns and then using a lot of case studies with a lot of real examples of artwork and targeting and psychographics and so forth to illustrate them. We were toying with the idea of [a campaign]. But I think itâ€™s too complex to try and use our techniques to promote a book. It was more of a thought exercise right. It would mean having multiple versions multiple titles multiple dust sheets.","MB:A/B testing for a book? Is the book coming out in the New Year?","Nix:Itâ€™s coming out in Germany first because it was a German publisher that approached us. It will be coming out in about the next month or so and then later in the U.K.","MB:It is going to be about the company or methodology. Or your world view?","Nix:The English title is not confirmed yet but I think it will be something like â€œMad men to maths menâ€. Itâ€™s going to be [about] the evolution of the advertising industry, how data, how psychology, how digital is changing an industry that really hasnâ€™t changed very much. And what that disruption means in terms of an industry of you know multi-billion dollar industry and illustrating different campaigns that weâ€™ve done to show the effectiveness of that.","MB:On Brexit there were headlines such as â€˜The great Brexit robbery, our democracy was hijackedâ€™. How do you react to those?","Nix:Well, look, I mean youâ€™re implying therefore that we were involved in Brexit and part of that â€œrobberyâ€. Weâ€™ve been, again, crystal clear to all media including The Guardian, who really propagated this story from day one, based on nothing. Carole Cadwalladr has made it her personal mission to come after us again, living in denial about the outcome of the election. She cannot accept that the British people wanted to leave Europe and sheâ€™s made it her mission to vilify us. We did not work on Brexit. We didnâ€™t do a little bit of work. We didnâ€™t do a lot of work. We did no work on Brexit. We were not involved in the campaign for either Leave.eu or Vote Leave, at all. And we have been crystal clear on this which is why weâ€™re going to be taking them to court and weâ€™re going to settle.","MB:Why do you think you became associated with it then?","Nix:Well because before the campaigns were launched we were approached by a number of different campaigns, pro and against, to discuss whether there might be a role for us on Brexit. And we had a number of discussions. Obviously, these discussions made their way into the public forum but we meet with hundreds of companies every year and talk about business opportunities. That doesnâ€™t mean you engage with them doesnâ€™t mean you contract with them and it certainly doesnâ€™t mean that you work for them. But The Guardian came out with one or two data points and then created an entire narrative around that that was pure fiction. That went viral and then every other newspaper [piled into it]. If you tell a lie often enough it becomes truth. But even after we came out and denied that again and again and again they just kept propagating the same message.","MB:But you are working in other campaigns. Thereâ€™s been some controversy about Kenya and South Africa for instance. How do you react to those?","Nix:Well, you are talking about Bell Pottinger, [which has] paid the consequences for some bad decisions.","MB:Did you work on those campaigns?","Nix:No, we werenâ€™t involved with the actors. We werenâ€™t involved with Bell Pottinger, we werenâ€™t involved with the Guptas. In fact, I know very little about that. And I really canâ€™t make a commentary on what happened. I know only what Iâ€™ve read in the paper.","MB:You worked on the Kenya campaign?","Nix:Weâ€™ve worked all across Africa.","MB:Kenya?","Nix:Well, letâ€™s wait till the electionâ€™s over because we never talk about elections that live, generally, as a rule of thumb. But I can tell you that we worked in Kenya in 2013 on the last election for Kenyatta. Thatâ€™s well documented. I can speak to that. Look, Kenyatta won by 12 points and there were some few irregularities, from what Iâ€™ve read, in the way that the election oversight committeeâ€¦ [granted] some of the tenders [for] election equipment. The opposition used these irregularities to challenge the outcome of the election. I think had this been a â€œFloridaâ€ years ago when it came down to half a percent, ok. But when youâ€™re talking about a 12 percent victory I think that the courtâ€™s decision to hold this [new] election was a dreadful decision. I think that it is going to result in dreadful bloodshed, horrific violence. If Kenyatta for any reason doesnâ€™t win this election then his supporters are going to feel robbed. And if Odingaâ€™s people donâ€™t, theyâ€™re going to feel that heâ€™s cheated again because thatâ€™s the perception that Odinga is put out into the public domain.","I canâ€™t see this ending well. I think just for the sake of Kenya, for peace in the region, I think itâ€™s a dreadful decision. I actually canâ€™t even see this election being resolved in the next month. I think itâ€™s going to drag on. So, I think the courtâ€™s decision was shortsighted.","MB:Whatâ€™s your answer to critics who claimed that youâ€™ve worked on behalf of the Russian government or third party actors connect to them? Either for specifically in relation to Trumpâ€™s campaign or to other campaigns.","Nix:Weâ€™ve never been asked directly. No one of authority has levelled any direct criticisms to us and, certainly, no one has suggested that weâ€™d been or alleged that weâ€™d been involved as far as Iâ€™m aware. Weâ€™re not under investigation by anyone. We are helping wherever we can with the understandings of the campaign, like everyone else in the campaign, but thereâ€™s no investigation into Cambridge [Analytica].","MB:Isnâ€™t the U.S. Congress investigating you in connection with Russian attempts to interfere with the election?","Nix:No, itâ€™s not. The US Congress is undertakingâ€¦","MB:The Atlantic magazine reported it.","Nix:[Scoffs] Oh then it must be true! I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ I mean thatâ€™s exactly what Iâ€™m talking about. My understanding is that the U.S. Congress is undertaking an investigation into Russian interference into the election and theyâ€™ve asked all sorts of people for help into that. Thatâ€™s not suggesting in any way, any way at all, that Cambridge is under investigation. And you know weâ€™re more than happy to help. We never worked in Russia. We never worked for Russia. I want to be careful, but I donâ€™t think we have any Russian employees in our company whatsoever. We just donâ€™t have business in Russia. We have no involvement with Russia, never have done.","MB:What about for third parties associated with Putinâ€™s government?","Nix:I wouldnâ€™t even know who they were and where to begin. I mean, we worked directly for the campaign, as in directly, and we worked for a Super Pac in support of the campaign [called] â€œdefeat crooked Hillaryâ€ was itâ€™s unofficial title or â€œkeep the promiseâ€ or something.","MB:You have an investor, Robert Mercer. What sort of independence that give you? He has known political views. Do you feel independent of an investor like that?","Nix:Well, actually, Iâ€™m not going to speak about any of our investors or board members at all because we donâ€™t. But I can answer your question which is â€˜is our political ideology influenced by other people in the companyâ€™ at whatever level? And the answer to that [is this]â€¦ We undertake 7 to 9 elections a year, somewhere in the world, for Prime Minister or President. And for as many of those are on the Left of Centre or the Right of Centre. In fact, if you were to total them up, I would probably say â€“ and this is based on a guesstimate â€“ that weâ€™d done more Left-leaning than Right-leaning. Now, clearly in Americaâ€¦","MB:Can you give me any examples of those Left-leaning campaigns?","Nix:Youâ€™d have to go on our website. Iâ€™m sure you could find 25, and you can just see which parties. Itâ€™ll all be there. But in America you have to pick a side. You canâ€™t flip-flop. You are not encouraged work for the Democrats in one cycle and then move to the Republicans [on the next]. And the reason the Republicans were attractive to us was because the Democrats were significantly leading the tech arms race. Under Obama through Civas and Blue Labs they had pioneered the use of big data. They were using very sophisticated digital technologies. And the Republicans had been left behind. By the time Romney lost in 2012 there was a vacuum. There just wasnâ€™t the tech talent on the Right to be able to compete. It was like taking a knife to a gunfight. And so that was the commercial opportunity. Now, the reason for that is because most of the tech community, and Iâ€™m going to generalize here, but a lot of the tech community that were politically oriented tended to lean Left. People in Berkeley and MIT, and so forth, would, if they were politically motivated, support Hillary or Obama. Whereas, people who might be more Right of centre, obviously, would look typically to go and work in banking or investment management with those skills. And so because of the dearth of talent the Republicans were getting murdered in the tech arms race. That was the commercial opportunity, that was the one we sought to address. Right? Had it been the other way around it might have been a different story.","MB:What are your own personal political views? Do you talk about those?Nix:We leave our personal ideologies at the door. We think that being â€œforeignâ€ and objective is an asset in elections. I think that a lot of political campaigns, and in the U.S., a lot of campaign staff and vendors get blinded by their own ideology. They blindly believe in their candidate to an extent that they actually canâ€™t see objectively whatâ€™s happening in the campaign. They can only see what they and all their friends believe and therefore they assume thatâ€™s representative of 200 million voters take","MB:[Youâ€™re saying] They project themselves onto campaigns?","Nix:Yeah naturally. And thereâ€™s something wonderful about coming into a foreign country as an outsider and looking with completely fresh eyes at a political landscape and be able to not have a clouded judgment. And thatâ€™s what we bring. And equally, itâ€™s like a good lawyer representing his or her client. You canâ€™t go in there with a preconception of guilty or not. You have to go in there and look at the facts. And thatâ€™s what we try to do.","MB:Do you have a blacklist of anyone you wouldnâ€™t work for?","Nix:Oh yes for sure. We only work for mainstream political parties. Tories, Labour, Republicans, Democrats. We steer clear of fringe political parties or minority groups. Weâ€™re not trying to orchestrate a revolution. Weâ€™re trying to provide the best techâ€¦ communication technology to political parties. As I said before, elections are about 20 percent of our revenue as a company. Weâ€™ve got about 20/25 percent in defence and homeland security. The rest is in the brand and commercial space. We are not a political company. Weâ€™re a tech company, and we see ourselves as tech company. We have a tech culture, where we attract academics. You know a third of our staff are PhDs. Weâ€™re geeks! Fundamentally, weâ€™re a bunch of geeky people who are trying to solve problems and I would say that politics is probably the least desirable division in the company, because it can be divisive and people donâ€™t necessarily like to get involved. But, if you give a data scientist a really challenging problem like identifying the ideology of a nation or an issue, a model or something, itâ€™s about solving the problem. It is not about trying to promote their own personal ideology or agenda or anything like that.","MB:Youâ€™re working with Palantir?","Nix:No. Palantir was established about nine or 10 years ago now. Theyâ€™re very active of course in the defence, homeland security. They were a pioneer and a leader in this field. Peter Thiel, in applying both his platforms, Gotham and Metropolis, and other work which is slightly more off the radar, it is truly revolutionary. I mean these guys were genuine first movers. And I think that companies like us have caught up. But kudos to them. They were really very early on to the scene.","MB:I think you count the Pentagon as a client donâ€™t you?","Nix:We formed a defence/government defence division in 2005. Over that period weâ€™ve worked for global militaries all over the world. We train a lot of armies in something called PSYOP, which is psychological operations or information operations, which is, sort of communication warfare. Itâ€™s trying to understand how to persuade troops not to fight or to persuade your troops to fight. Itâ€™s trying to combat hostile behaviour or how do you counter radicalization or counter-terrorism, and so forth. We do a lot of information operation programs ourselves [where] we go in to countries and conduct the research and the campaigns to change behaviour to reduce conflict. And our clients do include, in the U.K, the MOD and the FCO, and in the United States, all the â€˜comsâ€™, so NorthCom, Safcom, State Department, Pentagon and various â€˜three letter agenciesâ€™ and so forth.","MB:Whatâ€™s your whatâ€™s your vision for the future? Youâ€™ve talked about psychographic profiling, analytics about the amount of data sets there are, and the data you can pull out social media. And of course, we all know that Alexaâ€™s in their houses recording what they are saying. Where do you see things heading? Firstly, which direction do you feel your own company is going in, given the amount of data out there? Secondly, do you think you might end up butting up against the Google and Amazons in data collection?","Nix:There are several questions there. Letâ€™s start with the bigger picture. There are two technologies that Iâ€™m really excited by and that everyone is talking about. Clearly, IOT is going to totally radicalize the data market. I think the data business is doomed, myself. Itâ€™s a very, very high volume and very low margin [business]. As the internet of things grows, as we have sensors on everything: cars, fridges, TVs then data is going to become ubiquitous. Therefore the volume of data will increase, the price of data is going to go down. You wonâ€™t be able to sell data in the way you can today. I think people are going to start taking control of their data much more. There is going to be more reciprocity in the way that people share their data with companies like my own and other marketing agencies. But generally, the increase in data is one factor that is going to make analytics companies like ours more valuable. More data is going to need more analytics, period. And then at the other end â€” if you see it as a sandwich and weâ€™re in the middle â€” youâ€™ve got blockchain. And by having distributed ledger technology youâ€™re going to an ability to have transparency, and to have accountability as to how data is and data sets are being used and implemented, forevermore, in perpetuity. And so, yes the data landscape is getting more frightening with IOT. But on the other hand, itâ€™s going to be to be more self-regulated through the Blockchain and itâ€™s going to be more transparent. And both of those things are the bread rolls with the analytics being the chess in the middle of the sandwich. Analytics are going to play more and more of a function in deciphering huge quantities of data, making sense of it, applying it into many different areas and then using blockchain technologies to securitise that.","In terms of the advertising industry: Look, Iâ€™ve been very vocal about this but I donâ€™t think that, again, Iâ€™m sort of some sort of â€˜soothsayerâ€™. I think a lot of people in the industry recognize thisâ€¦ And even if they are only whispering to each otherâ€¦ I think the advertising industry is like lemmings on the edge of a cliff. They canâ€™t go backwards and forwards looks terrifying. Omnicom, Dentsu, WPPâ€¦ theyâ€™re trying to pivot. Theyâ€™re acquiring companies left right and centre. But you canâ€™t just buy a data company and squash it together with an ad agency and hope itâ€™s just going to work. It doesnâ€™t work like that, that itâ€™s a different culture. It takes integration. You need to grow these things together. Youâ€™ve got all the consultancies which saw a commercial opportunity in the last two or three years and started acquiring data companies. Theyâ€™re trying to acquire advertising agencies in order to get into this space. Then nipping at the heels of the big conglomerates and taking considerable market share from them. Youâ€™ve got the big brands themselves understanding their data is so valuable they no longer want to give that away to advertising agencies. They can bring some of these capabilities in-house and have their own data analytics and marketing agencies in-house. Thatâ€™s damaging them.","Then youâ€™ve got the small disruptors like us who are only going to become more numerous. Weâ€™re eating a piece of the pie. So, I think there is going to be a reckoning, and itâ€™s happening now. WPPâ€™s market share has taken a nosedive in the last month or three. But theyâ€™re not going to be the only ones. Itâ€™s going to continue. Iâ€™m not suggesting that theyâ€™re all going to go bust, but I am saying itâ€™s â€œadapt or dieâ€. This market is fundamentally shifting and about time too! This is overdue. Gone are the days where an advertiser does an advert. And as long as the clientâ€™s wife likes it there are no metrics other than audience recall to quantify its success. Or very few. And they donâ€™t care anymore. They can just squeeze a lemon and get some money out of advertisers. I think that advertisers want more accountability, they want more measurement of effectiveness, they want empirical data to be able to justify these enormous multi-billion dollar spends.","MB:Letâ€™s fast forward say,10-20 years. There will be people who can afford to buy privacy and then there will be plenty of people who will give away their data in return for services, as they do now. Do we do we think that thatâ€™s a good situation to be in? Whatâ€™s your view?","Nix:I think gone are the days where people just click a box without really thinking it through, and all their data has just been siphoned away and gone. Grabbed. I think people are recognizing that data is valuable AND that theyâ€™re [also] saying, â€œWell actually itâ€™s not that sensitive. I donâ€™t really care much if people understand my shopping habits or what car I drive. This isnâ€™t health or financial data. But it is valuable and why should I just give it away so that other firms and advertisers can make money out of it?â€ So I see more of a reciprocity. I see people having something like a virtual data wallet. Theyâ€™re going to have control of their data. Youâ€™ll be able to say to them â€œHey can I licence your data or use your data for a certain campaign or purpose?â€ And thereâ€™s going to be an exchange there. Theyâ€™re going to say â€œYes you can but itâ€™s going to cost you 10 percent off thatâ€ or â€œI want this in return.â€ And I see that market emerging as people take control. I think thatâ€™s really sensible. I think it gives people more control and therefore it gives them more protection. I think advertisers will need to be a little more targeted in the way that they use data and they gather data, which is probably good. But actually, itâ€™s not going to dent the industry or the direction that itâ€™s growing in. So I really hope that people like the ICO [Information Commissionerâ€™s Office in the UK which rules on data privacy for individuals], who are suddenly trying to catch up on the last five years of data. I hope that they understand that the regulation needs to be there to protect consumers, but not to stump the growth of an industry that could really do a lot of good. Not just in communications, [but] across all corporate sectors.","MB:If consumers had more control over their data wouldnâ€™t that start to slightly stump the work that you do?","Nix:No, I donâ€™t think it will because I think things are changing. I think that the older generation, our parents or even olderâ€¦ you know, this is a terrifying brave new world for them. â€œWhat do you mean someone knows what car I drive?!â€ â€œYes, mother they do know what car you driveâ€ â€œBut thatâ€™s awful!â€ â€œWhy is it awful?â€ â€œWell because I didnâ€™t want them to know that!â€ â€œDo you care?â€ â€œThatâ€™s not the point.â€ â€œWell, it is the point!â€ Actually, the new generation, the next generation, younger than us, they donâ€™t care. They actually just donâ€™t care.","MB:They are used to this world?","Nix:They are used to this world and they realize it. â€œDo I care if people know what car I drive, what cereal I eat for breakfast?â€ And why should they, really? They donâ€™t care if they put a picture of themselves blind drunk on Facebook doing something. They donâ€™t care. Let alone [someone knowing] what car they drive.","MB:Do they care if they feel that it might influence an election?","Nix:Well, thatâ€™s a good question. Ultimately, I donâ€™t think people are naive, now, especially not the Internet generation, the Millennials. I think they do understand whatâ€™s going on. Thereâ€™s been so much press. Itâ€™s not about hoodwinking people. Remember, itâ€™s the same for all sides. Itâ€™s not like Trump had some secret sauce that he was employing with Cambridge that the Democrats didnâ€™t. Hillaryâ€™s data and digital teams were up to 200 people or something! Huge! Huge! This was tried and tested. It was a machine! They were doing everything! But the reason theyâ€™re not in the spotlight is twofold. A: Hillary lost. And B: Trumpâ€™s, you know, is somewhat perceived by many as more of a polarizing character. Thatâ€™s why. Itâ€™s not what we did. I mean, I think if weâ€™d done exactly the same work, no different, but done it for Hillaryâ€¦","MB:You think the result would have been the same?","Nix:No, I think no one would care. The Guardian wouldnâ€™t be writing these stupid headlines and nor would The New York Times. They wouldnâ€™t care. This is not about Cambridge. Itâ€™s not about our tech. Itâ€™s about Trump.","It was always kind of shady that Facebook let you volunteer your friendsâ€™ status updates, check-ins, location, interests and more to third-party apps. While this let developers build powerful, personalized products, the privacy concerns led Facebook to announce at F8 2014 that it would shut down the Friends data API in a year. Now that time has come, with the forced migration to Graph API v2.0 leading to the friendsâ€™ dataÂ API shutting down, and a few other changes happening on April 30.","Today Facebook assembled journalists in San Francisco to discuss the rhetoric behind the change. All apps created since April 20, 2014, already have the new systems, so youâ€™ve probably seen them in the wild. But all new developers must comply with updated APIs, or their connection to Facebook will stop working.","Job Fusion will have to shut down its referral engine","Some users will see it as a positive move that returns control of personal data to its rightful owners. Just because youâ€™re friends with someone, doesnâ€™t mean you necessarily trust their judgment about what developers are safe to deal with. Now, each user will control their own data destiny.","Along with the year notice, Facebook reviewed 5,000 of the top apps and sent them feedback about how their app will perform after the change. Its goal has been to minimize the impact on users.","Facebookâ€™s Simon Cross told reporters that Mark Zuckerberg said one of Facebookâ€™s new slogans is â€˜People Firstâ€™, because â€œif people donâ€™t feel comfortable using Facebook and specifically logging in Facebook and using Facebook in apps, we donâ€™t have a platform, we donâ€™t have developers.â€","To inform its new policies, Facebook did extensive in-person research, asking users how they felt about their privacy when they used Facebook with apps. It came away believing that to ensure the long-term health of the ecosystem, itÂ has to give users confidence in how their app privacy is handled. When people are confident, â€œthey feel happier and use our stuff more, and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re tying to achieveâ€ says Cross.","On the other hand, some developers will have significantly change how their apps work, or turn them off altogether. For example, Job Fusion relied on the ability to pull where a userâ€™s friends work to show them job openings at those companies. Now Job Fusion is shutting downÂ its referral engine, though it will continue operating in different ways. Others going dark or that already have due to the change include CareerSonar, Jobs With Friends, and adzuna Connect.","Along with the friends data API change, Facebook is now requiring all apps to use its new login system, which gives users more granular control over what data they give developers.Â Previously, users provided all their data and permissions in two big screens. One for all personal info and one for the ability for an app to post to Facebook on your behalf.","Now on the log-in screen, developers must include an â€œEdit the info you provideâ€ link, which opens a checklist of all the data and permissions theyâ€™re asking for, including friend list, Likes, email address, and the ability to post to the News Feed. Users can tap the checkmarks to deny certain permissions.","Lastly, Facebook has now instituted Login Review, where a team of its employees audit any app that requires more than the basic data of someoneâ€™s public profile, list of friends, and email address. The Login Review team has now checked over 40,000 apps, and from the experience, created new, more specific permissions so developers donâ€™t have to ask for more than they need. Facebook revealed that apps now ask an average of 50 percent fewer permissions than before.","So what does April 30 mean for users? In some cases, nothing. Apps that donâ€™t need extra permissions and that function if theyâ€™re missing some like your email address will automatically get the new login systems and will work normally, and users wonâ€™t have to log back in. If a developer is significantly changing an app or needs more permissions, users may need to log back in, or the app might perform weirdly or show roadblock error messages. And some apps may simply cease to exist.","Apps donâ€™t have to delete data theyâ€™ve already pulled. If someone gave your data to an app, it could go on using it. However, if you request that a developer delete your data, it has to. However, how you submit those requests could be through a form, via email, or in other ways that vary app to app. You can also always go to your App Privacy SettingsÂ and remove permissions for an app to pull more data about you in the future.","Overall, the changes could boost confidence in Facebookâ€™s platform and the social network itself, which has struggled in the past with a reputation for spotty privacy. Cross says the conversion rate on people logging in with Facebook has increased 11 percentÂ andÂ believes this means â€œMore people feel comfortable logging in with Facebook.â€","Facebookâ€™s never been shy about prioritizing users over developers and advertisers. Itâ€™s repeatedly reduced app virality to protect usersâ€™ feeds from spam, and denied advertiser requests for more flashy, site takeover-style ads. Facebook knows that if it burns users now, usage will wither, and all developers will get hurt.","And while developers might not like the changes, Facebook tried to give them as much warning as possible."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

The company is probably second only to Google in the data it collects on users, but the info we all share on the Facebook site just isn't enough. A report from ProPublica published this week digs into the vast network of third-party data that Facebook can purchase to fill out what it knows about its users. The fact that Facebook is buying data on its users isn't new -- the company first signed a deal with data broker Datalogix in 2012 -- but ProPublica's report nonetheless contains a lot of info on the visibility Facebook may have into your life.","Currently, Facebook works with six data partners in the US: Acxiom, Epsilon, Experian, Oracle Data Cloud, TransUnion and WPP. For the most part, these providers deal in financial info; ProPublica notes that the categories coming from these sources include things like \"total liquid investible assets $1-$24,999,\" \"People in households that have an estimated household income of between $100K and $125K and \"Individuals that are frequent transactor at lower cost department or dollar stores.\" Specifically, the report notes that this data is focused on Facebook users' offline behavior, not just what they do online.","To be clear, the majority of the information that Facebook gathers comes directly from how its users interact with the site: ProPublica found that of the 29,000 categories Facebook provides to ad buyers, only 600 of them came from third-party data providers. But the catch here is that it's very difficult to opt out of having these providers share your data with Facebook. You'll have to contact each provider directly, and the process can be complex, buried behind pages of legalese.","For its part, Facebook says that it doesn't need to inform users with detail on how it uses third-party data services because they are the ones doing the tracking, not Facebook. \"Our approach to controls for third-party categories is somewhat different than our approach for Facebook-specific categories,\" Steve Satterfield, a Facebook manager of privacy and public policy, told ProPublica. \"This is because the data providers we work with generally make their categories available across many different ad platforms, not just on Facebook.\"","If you're the type of person who wants to keep your information as private as possible, you're probably not on Facebook anyway.

The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.","Cambridge has been largely funded by Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to the president who became an early board member and gave the firm its name. It has pitched its services to potential clients ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.","What kind of information was collected, and how was it acquired?","The data, a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook, and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads.","Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app, which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned.","The technique had been developed at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Center. The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing.","Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica.","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use.","Facebook said no passwords or “sensitive pieces of information” had been taken, though information about a user’s location was available to Cambridge.","So was Facebook hacked?","Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was not a data breach, because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes — and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account.","But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred “to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.” It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm.","Dr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","Cambridge Analytica officials, after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data, changed their story last week. In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","But the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","What is Facebook doing in response?","The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan’s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan’s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed.","Facebook also said: “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","In a further step, Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm “to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists.” It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr. Kogan had given a verbal commitment, while Mr. Wylie “thus far has declined.”","What are others saying?","Facebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica. Investors have not been pleased, sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday.","■ In Congress, Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have asked to hold a hearing on Facebook’s links to Cambridge Analytica. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, led by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected.","■ A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebook’s ties to Cambridge Analytica.","■ The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post.

The security services and police are restricted in their surveillance of private citizens on the web by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. Around 130,000 people signed a petition against it, largely because of the provision requiring internet providers to keep for up to a year records of all the websites that their users visited. One campaigner described it as “one of the most extreme surveillance laws ever passed in a democracy”.","Yet the material collected in this way can only be accessed under a system of legal and political oversight: the Home Office might like more powers, but the European court of justice ruled in December 2016 that independent judicial authorisation was needed for the “general and indiscriminate retention” of personal data. All that fuss over a year’s worth of websites, when it turns out that Facebook has been storing all the contact details, the instant messages, and the phone calls of millions of its users for as long as 10 years without anyone outside the firm realising what their apparently innocuous consent implied.","It would not be fair to blame Facebook alone for this. The victims of this policy were only the people who used its Messenger app on Android phones, and Android is a Google product. Apple’s rival phones don’t permit such indiscriminate harvesting of information. Although Google made this harder for phones updated since 2012, Android phones are notoriously slow to have their software upgraded, and the ability was still there even with the most modern phones until October last year. The hapless user believed only that they were allowing Facebook to look through their contacts to make it easier to reach them. In this instance, it is hard to blame Facebook entirely for taking advantage of a feature that Google had deliberately built. Both firms had a vital interest in collecting as much information as possible about their users – and everyone whom their users knew, on or off the network – and helping marketers to use it. What was then advertised or sold with the help of this once private information, whether it was goods or politicians, was of rather less interest. “Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?”, as Tom Lehrer sang.","However the blame is distributed, the central fact remains that these private companies have been able to embark on a programme of data collection that no government outside China has been able to undertake. They have done so without any judicial oversight of the kind that is meant to bind democratic government. They must now be reined in and brought within the law just as governments are.

The company said users have to “expressly agree to use the feature.”","“If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted,” Facebook wrote in the post. “While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.”","The blog post follows several media reports, including one from the tech website Ars Technica that details multiple examples in which Facebook tracked data such as the length of a phone call, who was it made to, and whether it was an outgoing or incoming call.","In the story, New Zealand Facebook user Dylan McKay downloaded his Facebook data as a Zip file and uncovered the findings. He says he told the website that he installed Messenger in 2015, but only gave it permissions that the Android version of the app needed to be installed. He claims he uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times since then, but did not give it permission to read his messaging and call history.","The story’s author, Sean Gallagher, noted that while the data collection is technically “opt-in,” it is the default setting for Facebook’s app and is not a separate notification. It also did not reveal that the data was being collected.","“In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used,” Gallagher wrote. “Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.”","The Ars Technica article adds that Facebook started to explicitly ask for permission for Messenger and Facebook Lite users to access their SMS and call data ‒ to “help friends find each other” ‒ after an outcry in 2016 over the way it handled collecting the data.","Originally, the message did not mention collecting SMS and call data, but simply offered an “OK” button to allow users to keep all of their SMS messages in one spot.","In its retort, Facebook was adamant that it does not sell the data to third parties and is stored “securely.”","“Your information is securely stored and we do not sell this information to third parties,” Facebook added in its post. “You are always in control of the information you share with Facebook.”","Facebook under fire","The Mark Zuckerberg-led company has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, most notably for the way it has handled the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","Over the weekend, Zuckerberg took out full-page newspaper ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and the U.K.’s The Observer, The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph to apologize and offer an explanation of what his company was doing to fix the situation.","“We have a responsibility to protect your information,” the ad starts. “If we can’t, we don’t deserve it.”","Facebook, which along with Google dominates the online advertising industry, has attracted intense scrutiny from lawmakers and other tech execs, including Apple’s Tim Cook, who have called for it to be regulated, something Zuckerberg said last week makes sense if done properly. “I actually am not sure we shouldn’t be regulated,” Zuckerberg told CNN in a pre-taped interview.”","Lawmakers have also requested that Zuckerberg testify before Congress on the Cambridge Analytica mess, something he said he would be open to."],"isopubdate":""}

A date has not yet been set, and the spokesperson for the House committee declined to confirm reports that the hearing was scheduled for 12 April.","The Senate judiciary and commerce committees have also invited Zuckerberg to appear at hearings. His decision to testify before the US Congress was first reported by CNN, and contrasts with his refusal to appear before members of parliament in the UK.","The chair of a British committee of MPs on Tuesday said Zuckerberg’s decision to send other executives to the UK to answer questions on his behalf was “absolutely astonishing”.","However, news of US congressional evidence paves the way for a major showdown for Zuckerberg, 33, who has come under increasing pressure from lawmakers and the general public to account for Facebook’s business practices since the company acknowledged last September that it had sold advertisements to Russian agents seeking to influence the US presidential election.","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","In October, Facebook sent its general counsel, Colin Stretch, to run the gauntlet of two days of congressional hearings while Zuckerberg travelled to China and shared photos of his Halloween costume on his Facebook profile.","But the clamor for a show of public accountability reached a fever pitch following the Observer’s reporting that the Facebook data of about 50 million Americans was acquired by the political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica after being harvested by another company.","Five days after the story broke, Zuckerberg stepped out from behind his carefully curated Facebook profile – his typical mode of making public statements – to answer questions from a select group of media organizations.","‘A grand illusion’: seven days that shattered Facebook’s facade","Read more","In remarkably similar comments to CNN, the New York Times, Wired and tech website Recode, he said he would testify if he was the person at Facebook most knowledgable about the subject matter.","While Zuckerberg’s trip to Capitol Hill might mollify American officials, it will probably only increase the frustration of snubbed British MPs.

One is that the Facebeook CEO feels “fundamentally uncomfortable sitting here in California in an office making content policy decisions for people around the world,” as he told Recode. This sentiment echoes his manifesto on the future of Facebook from earlier this year, in which he called for “a system of more local governance,” for the same reason: He can’t figure out by himself how to set standards of behavior for Facebook’s more than 2 billion monthly active users.","It’s a sensible realization, and it wouldn’t be surprising if it came from anyone but Zuckerberg. This is the person, after all, who has managed to structure his company so as to retain monarchic powers despite being a minority owner. This is the company whose leading shareholders allowed that to happen. How would a company whose shareholders don’t even trust themselves ever enable meaningful user governance?","The current crisis of trust for Facebook should be a wake-up call that the tech giant—and others like it—need more appropriate structures of ownership and accountability.","Most of the talk about how to handle Facebook’s vast troves of valuable personal user data has revolved around regulation. Zuckerberg, along with Apple’s Tim Cook, have outright invited such oversight, and Europe’s new data protections are forcing them to plan for it anyway. Commentators from Steve Bannon to Zeynep Tufekci have called for Facebook to be treated as a public utility, like power companies and telecoms. Before legal advisors got the better of him, presumably, Zuckerberg himself used to refer to the company as a “social utility.”","Some well-placed rules might do a lot of good. But heavy regulation can also backfire. Think of what our most highly regulated, utility-scale industries look like—Comcast, PG&E, AT&T. Airlines. Big banks. Many of these are among the most hated companies out there. Zealous regulation can result in regulatory capture; a few big firms can afford enough lobbyists to write their own rules, which tend to be are so onerous that they make it impossible for smaller competitors to challenge the incumbents. Regulation thus ends up subsidizing the big firms’ investor-owners and reducing the incentive for providing quality service.","We might also consider whether governments, especially the ones we currently have, can be trusted to protect our personal data. The Department of Justice, for instance, is seeking rules to ensure its ability to access data on encrypted phones; Congress has permitted ISPs to sell their customers’ personal data.","There are other ways to imagine organizing a social network of Facebook’s scale—ways better aligned with Zuckerberg’s ambition of “local governance.” One of the few companies that rivals Facebook’s scope is the Associated Press, the newswire service that claims to reach over half the world’s population every day with its reports. The fact that we tend not to think of the AP in the same breath as Facebook is a signal of its success; the goal of a good platform should be that we don’t notice it.","The AP was formed in the 1840s as an association of New York City newspapers that needed to share resources like telegraph wires and horseback couriers. It has since endured its share of Facebook-like controversy; Upton Sinclair once called it “the most powerful and most sinister monopoly in America.” But a decisive turning point came with a 1945 Supreme Court decision that forced the AP to become a truly open-membership cooperative, owned and governed by the competing news agencies that use it, which run the ideological gamut from Fox News to the New York Times. It provides its member companies—including my local paper—with much-needed reportage from all over the world. In a moment of media polarization, the AP has stuck to the center by virtue of its diverse ownership structure—which is to say, the structure of its accountability.","Calls have been mounting for antitrust action against the new tech behemoths—not only Facebook, but also Amazon, Google, and others. Too rarely do these proposals involve fundamentally changing how the platforms are owned and governed.","One approach, following the AP example, would be to reorganize Facebook into an association of diverse, interoperable social networks among which users could choose. The central company would act as a kind of franchiser, managing the core technology and underlying infrastructure; the smaller member-owner companies would compete for users by offering varied options on matters of ad deployment, data standards, content filtering, and even interface design. Like the internet’s most essential and resilient social network—email—the result would be a blend of unity and diversity. Like AP, also, Facebook would be insulated from the day-to-day economic temptations of the ad business.","The technology for such “federated” social networks has existed for years; the trouble is that the allure of monopolism has so far prevented more competitive models from flourishing.","A second approach might involve a more direct form of user-ownership, in which the company as a whole remains unified but individual Facebook users, together, wield significant ownership and governance powers. This would be especially well-aligned with one of Zuckerberg’s stated ambitions: “I hope that we can explore examples of how collective decision-making might work at scale.” Handling such governance would not be easy, but already large-scale co-ops and mutuals—think REI and Northwestern Mutual—do a fairly good job of serving member interests without being toppled by the fleeting whims of the crowd. The electric utility co-ops that supply electricity to much of rural America receive consistently higher customer service ratings than their investor-owned counterparts. If companies like Facebook are going to hold the data of our daily lives, the surest route to security and a sustainable business is for us to hold a stake in those companies in turn.","The path to either of these outcomes is not easy or clear. They are goals to work toward, not short-term fixes. And achieving them will require a mix of policy intervention and ingenuity. Perhaps the process could begin with Zuckerberg's promised stock sell-off. One way or another, it is time to look beyond the ownership structures the online economy currently has to the ones we need for a healthier future.","The Cambridge Analytica case now plaguing Facebook is not a hack or a breach; it’s the rule, not an exception. It’s a symptom of a problem we already knew we had but were content to ignore. Facebook, Google, Amazon, and firms like them hold reams of data about us whose potential for abuse—if not now, in the future—may exceed the companies’ incentive to act in our interests. As online networks mature from dorm-room experiments to social utilities, our expectations should mature with them. Even Zuckerberg seems to realize that his network isn’t just his anymore. We give it value by acting like it is ours, by sharing our lives like it is ours. The nature of the company should reflect this."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

For some, this is an indication that their online data isn’t safe; the #DeleteFacebook hashtag began trending shortly after the news broke, and though the numbers aren’t in, users may be leaving the platform in droves.","For others, it’s yet another indication of the tragic state of modern politics, since the ill-gotten data was used as part of President Trump’s 2016 campaign.","But for marketers like me, this is a learning experience. This is an interesting scandal for a few different reasons, and Facebook executives have done a poor job of explaining it fully to the public, or recovering from this veritable PR disaster.","So what’s really happening here, and what should marketers learn from this experience?","What Really Happened","If it’s hard to find a concise explanation of what happened, there’s a reason—this is a complicated situation. Here’s the gist of what happened: several years ago, Facebook exposed data from 50 million users to an academic researcher, who used a quiz app to pull more user data than he should have reasonably gotten. That researcher then sold that user data to analytics firm Cambridge Analytica (CA). CA then used that user data as part of Trump’s marketing and advertising campaign.","Since then, the FTC has announced an investigation, hoping to learn more about how Facebook handles user data, and there have been calls for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. Facebook’s stock has plunged in the days following.","Again, this leaves out several details, but the gist of the story is what’s important for our purposes.","How Facebook Responded","When the news broke, the media went crazy, and users demanded an answer for what they perceived to be a serious misuse of their data. It took Mark Zuckerberg several days to respond, but he eventually wrote an extended post about the situation on Facebook.","Zuckerberg outlined a timeline of events, from 2007 to present day, explaining what happened, and pointing out that Facebook already took steps in 2014 to prevent this kind of thing from happening. Zuckerberg also apologized, and mentioned new updates on the horizon designed to give users more transparency about how their data is collected and used.","A few days later, Zuckerberg purchased full-page ads in multiple national newspapers, reiterating some of what was included in his Facebook message and prominently stating: “We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it.” It was an impressive step to take, but it didn’t come until more than a week after the initial news broke.","Could Facebook Have Recovered?","This is a big, important, story, but its effects could have been mitigated had Facebook acted faster. The initial app began collecting data as early as 2013, and Facebook pressured Cambridge Analytica to delete their data in 2015—but it took until a week after news of the scandal broke to start publicly addressing user concerns. By that point, underinformed users were freaking out and deleting the app, and the media was dragging the Facebook brand through the mud, calling for Zuckerberg to speak up.","A major point of this scandal is its secrecy—nobody knew this data was being collected or used—so further attempts to obfuscate the truth, or run from it, only made matters worse for Facebook.","What Marketers Can Learn","Now for the important part. What can we, as marketers, learn from this incident?","Be proactive. Nobody can predict the future, but you can be proactive by getting ahead of the news whenever you can. Announcing a PR scandal before it hits mainstream headlines gives you the chance to control the message, and set the tone. By the time Facebook got to chime in, sensationalist headlines had already made Facebook out to be the bad guy in the situation.","Offer transparency. Trust in corporations is at an all-time low. Offering transparency is a gesture of good faith to your audience, building their trust in your organization. Withholding details, or being perceived that you’re withholding details, can be a death sentence for your brand. Even if you look bad because of it, it’s almost always better to be honest.","Respond quickly. One of Facebook’s biggest mistakes was waiting several days before responding officially to news of the scandal. If you can’t get ahead of a PR scandal or a bit of bad news about your company, you better be sure you act fast in response to it. The longer your customers spend thinking about the situation, the more time they’ll have to form opinions about what happened, and why. Even if you’re missing some of the details, you need to make a statement.","Admit fault. Zuckerberg did a great job of providing details regarding the incident in his blog post, but (perhaps rightfully) spent much of the post discussing how the researcher and Cambridge Analytica were to blame for the incident. At the end of the post, he did admit fault, though in a fairly general sense rather than specifically, stating “I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I’m responsible for what happens on our platform.” Admitting fault is vital if you want your statement to be taken seriously, and it’s important to outline what you will do to prevent the problem from happening again. Zuckerberg did a great job of outlining this in his post.","Apologize. Offering a sincere apology, and telling customers how you failed them is a gesture of humility, and is often the first step to restoring trust. While Zuckerberg did a good job of telling users how Facebook failed them, Zuckerberg did not issue a direct apology in his post, which several users pointed out in the comments section of it.","Regardless of how you feel about Facebook, or how you feel about the state of modern online user privacy, this is a classic example of a PR disaster and brand management in action.","It’s hard to say if better marketing and PR moves could have prevented the severity of this media-blasted nightmare for Facebook, but you can certainly use this information to improve your own brand’s image—regardless of whether you have any scandals in your future.","Founder & CEO of AudienceBloom, a Seattle-based content marketing firm, as well as EmailAnalytics, an email productivity app, and Kwippy, an iOS/Android app in which users receive themed photo challenges randomly throughout the day.

However, Facebook is not the victim. The most significant social network in the world is just as guilty as CA and SCL for this particular “breach” — it wasn’t a data breach in the actual sense of the word. What’s worse is that Facebook knew about this “hack” for years and never acknowledged it until now.","“The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent,” an update posted on Saturday morning on Facebook’s blog post reads. “People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","So, apparently, people thought that CA stole data from 50 million people and then used it to target particular groups with political messages to sway them over to the Trump side? That would have been a great thing for Facebook.","But CA and SCL obtained they data by doing precisely what other Facebook app developers did. They played by the rules available to them at the time those data-harvesting apps were created. If CA and SCL had tech that was able to collect all your data, and data about your friends, then that’s because how the Facebook apps game worked.","This kind of experiences were devised by Facebook, and access to user data was probably what lured in developers and companies looking to turn the growing power of social media into revenue. And user data can be precious if you want to sell your product. Even if that product is Ted Cruz or Donald Trump.","Here’s what Kogan was able to extract from Facebook back in early May 2014, well ahead of the Trump vs. Clinton election — the following screenshot was published in a The New York Times expose that you need to read, right alongside Facebook’s explanation of what went wrong:","Just because smart folks at CA and SCL figured out how to game Facebook to their advantage doesn’t make Facebook a victim. Particularly because the company knew what happened soon after it happened. Had Facebook made a big deal about it two years ago, maybe things would have happened differently.","One crucial detail in this whole mess is that Facebook allowed the data collection of this app for academic research. Has anyone else obtained such access to user data under similar conditions?","Let’s not forget that there’s one other big corporation out there that used Facebook to help Trump win, and whose CEO was reelected for one more six-year term with what will probably be a considerable percentage of the popular vote. Russia gamed Facebook via fake news and political ad buys. But is it possible that bright people in Russia were also able to collect data about Facebook users just like CA did?","What about other intelligence agencies in the world? If for-profit companies were able to extract all that data out of Facebook, isn’t it safe to say that intelligence agencies may have been just as eager to spy on certain Facebook users especially in these post-Snowden times?","And finally, what would Mark Zuckerberg, the presidential candidate, do with all the data Facebook collects about its users who happen to be registered American voters?","Speaking of Snowden, he was quick to react to Facebook’s CA problems. He also seems to think Facebook is an accomplice rather than a victim.","Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post. They are not victims. They are accomplices. https://t.co/mRkRKxsBcw","Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as \"surveillance companies.\" Their rebranding as \"social media\" is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

It provides a unique opportunity to receive messages and emails directly from the Prime Minister.”","The BJP’s online showcase for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the NaMo App, which is under the spotlight in the wake of the debate over data privacy in social media, asks users to provide access to as many as 22 personal features on their devices, including location, photographs and contacts, microphone and camera.","A comparative analysis by The Indian Express shows that this is more than what the official app of the Prime Minister’s Office, PMO India App, asks users to volunteer — access to 14 data points. The Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology’s citizen-engagement app, MyGov app, asks for permission to access nine data points.","The NaMo app updates users about achievements of the BJP government, and provides access to the audio of Prime Minister’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’.","On Saturday, the user of Twitter handle @fs0c131y, described on the account as a “French security expert” and who identified himself to The Indian Express as Robert Baptiste, said the app may be providing personal user data to a third party without the users’ consent. He identified the company as US-based Clever Tap.","A day after these claims, the privacy policy at narendramodi.in — the website associated with the NaMo app — was updated to state that certain user information may be shared with third party services to “offer a better user experience”, “most contextual content and updates”.","The policy earlier stated: “Your personal information and contact details shall remain confidential and shall not be used for any purpose other than our communication with you. The information shall not be provided to third parties in any manner whatsoever without your consent.”","When contacted by The Indian Express for comment, the BJP IT Cell chief Amit Malviya did not respond to a specific question on whether this information was shared with a third party without the users’ consent.","Responding to a detailed questionnaire sent Saturday, Malviya said Sunday that data from the app is shared with a “third party service” for analytics, similar to Google Analytics. “The data in no way is stored or used by the third party services. Analytics and processing on the user data is done for offering users the most contextual content… It also enables a unique, personalised experience according to a person’s interests,” he said.","Described on PlayStore as the Official App of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the NaMo App mentions “Bharatiya Janata Party, 11 Ashoka Road, New Delhi-110001”, which used to be BJP headquarters till early last month, as the address of the developer.","Other political parties, too, use apps to connect to the electorate. The Congress party’s ‘With INC’ App demands access to ten data tracks. The SP App published by Anil Yadav, who describes himself as “Media Spokesperson, Samajwadi Party” on his verified Twitter account, requires three data access points.","The NaMo App is promoted through official government channels. Exam Warriors, Modi’s recently launched book aimed at the students preparing for the annual school exams, encourages readers to download the NaMo app. The book was launched by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Minister for Human Resource Development Prakash Javadekar in English, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Hindi.","On March 23, The Indian Express reported that personal data of nearly 13 lakh NCC cadets was being collected so that the Prime Minister could interact with them. In a letter sent on February 23, the Director General of NCC told state directorates that the collection of data will facilitate this interaction “…by downloading ‘Narendra Modi App’ in the cell phones of the cadets”.","According to NaMo App’s description, “it brings to you the latest information, instant updates & helps you contribute towards various tasks. It provides a unique opportunity to receive messages and emails directly from the Prime Minister.”","Under details, the app specifies that “no permission is compulsory on the NM app” and has the facility that the user can disable the access for these permissions in settings. However, when it is downloaded, most of the permissions are given by default. It also mentions that the app can be accessed without registering with an email address or phone.","According to the Supreme Court’s ruling on privacy in August 2017, informed consent is important for data protection and data privacy. The fact that permissions for the NaMo app are not compulsory can only be found if one goes through the Read More section of the app — users are not informed of it when downloading the app.","Malviya said, “Each function asks for the specific permission when access is required. The app does not ask for blanket permissions when the app is started.”","When the app is downloaded, it asks for access to the media stored on the phone, which can be denied. It does allow use of the app without registering, but a lot of the app’s features do not function in guest mode, or without allowing all the permissions sought. Malviya said that “unlike most Apps” the NaMo app allows users access in guest mode without “any permission or data”. The permissions required for the app, he added, “are all contextual and cause-specific”.","On Saturday, Baptiste had tweeted: “When you create a profile in the official @narendramodi #Android app, all your device info (OS, network type, Carrier .) and personal data (email, photo, gender, name, .) are send without your consent to a third-party domain called http://in.wzrkt.com.”","Baptiste said that wzrkt.com was a property of a company named Clever Tap. Actually, Clever Tap is a company owned by Wizrocket, which is a data analytics start-up founded in Mumbai in May 2013, and is now headquartered in California. On its website, Clever Tap mentions that it helps organisations analyse data for stronger engagement with their users. It helps its clients, it says on its website under user segmentation to “influence” app users’ “behaviour” by uncovering key insights across various dimensions.","The NaMo App does not have any specific option of users consenting to their data being shared with Clever Tap.","Speaking to The Indian Express, Baptiste said, “the main issue” is that “personal” information of users is “shared without the consent of the user” with a third-party company. “These data can be used for a lot of things after that (sic),” he said. “Like they did for Cambridge Analytica for example.”","He was referring to the UK-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which is at the centre of a worldwide storm over its role in illegally using private information of Facebook users to influence election campaigns.","Baptiste said the NaMo App does not share all the data that it has access to on users’ phones with Clever Tap, but only information gathered at the time of registration. It means though the app continues to hold access to photographs, location, microphone, camera, identity, contacts, etc., it only shares information like the mobile operating system, telecom carrier, email, gender, name and photograph used for app registration.","In his response, Malviya said the app “provides a platform for millions of his fans and party cadre to connect directly with the Prime Minister”. Calling it “one of its kind”, he said the app “enables unprecedented engagement and interactivity”, and is “way different” from apps of other parties and their leaders, which are “one-way” flow. He mentioned various “path-breaking engagement activities”, including the exam warrior module, of the app.","Regarding Baptiste’s claims, Malviya said the user was only sharing his or her own data. “This is not a security breach. The person does not have access to any data apart from his own data,” he said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Although only about 270,000 people took the survey, the New York Times reports that Kogan was able to obtain data on 50 million users, likely through connections between friends on the network. While the project promised users the data collection was only for research purposes, it nevertheless funneled the data to Cambridge Analytica, which had funded the development of the app to the tune of $800,000. Kogan had also received funding from the Russian government for his research into the psychology of Facebook users, the Guardian reported.","We don’t yet know how effective Cambridge Analytica’s targeting, based on psychological profiles its CEO has described as its “secret sauce,” truly was, but after working with Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign in the Republican primary, Cambridge Analytica was tapped by the Trump campaign. The company also did data analytics work on the successful Leave.EU campaign that resulted in a vote for Britain to exit the European Union. What we do seem to have, following these revelations about the source of some of the company’s data, is yet another in a long string of instances and coincidences—like the meetings between Trump campaign staff and Russian operatives—that look a lot like a willingness to cheat to win the White House, possibly in violation of the law. And in this case, cheating with data that was taken through Facebook’s front door.","Cambridge Analytica isn’t your typical data analytics firm. Its primary backer is Robert Mercer, the secretive billionaire and former CEO of the New York investment firm Renaissance Technologies whose family is also one of the main funders of Breitbart News and was the largest donor to Trump-backing Super PACs during the 2016 election. Steve Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, was the vice president of Cambridge Analytica’s board at the same time he was chairman of Breitbart News.","The data firm started partnering with U.S. political campaigns around 2015 with the promise that it had the ability to do what it called “psychographic” targeting, which allowed Cambridge Analytica to create psychological profiles to “effectively engage and persuade voters using specially tailored language and visual ad combinations” that appeal to each person on an emotional level, according to Cambridge Analytica’s website. The company claims it’s able to build these profiles by leveraging “up to 5,000 data points on over 230 million American voters.” That last number is a lot bigger than the 50 million people reported in the New York Times, and it’s unclear where that remaining data came from.","Cambridge Analytica began contracting for Trump’s campaign in June 2016, roughly six months after the Guardian reported that the company, when working for Cruz, was targeting voters using data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge. Facebook confirmed in August 2016 that data from Kogan’s app collected and misused data from the company and that Facebook was taking efforts to delete it. Still, Facebook didn’t alert users that their data had potentially ended up in the hands of Republican operatives.","The personality quiz created by Kogan appeared in 2014 on a platform for freelancers run by Amazon called Mechanical Turk.* The quiz, posted by Kogan’s company Global Science Research, offered to pay participants $1 or $2 to complete it and also required participants to download an app and consent to sharing data about themselves and their social network. At the time the quiz and app were running, Facebook permitted app developers to access data about a person’s network, like the names of their friends, as well as their likes and other personal details about themselves and their network, according to Facebook’s head of security, Alex Stamos, in a series of now-deleted tweets. The company says it has now updated its policies to let users decide what information Facebook can share about them.","Facebook says, however, that when Kogan passed the data he collected to Cambridge Analytica, he violated the company’s rather permissive data collection rules and in 2015 demanded that Kogan and everyone he handed the data to destroy it and certify that they did so. Facebook says it received certifications that the data was deleted from both Kogan and Cambridge Analytica, as well as from Christopher Wylie, who helped to found Cambridge Analytica. (Wylie and other former employees of the company gave interviews to the New York Times and the Guardian about Cambridge Analytica.) But apparently not all the data was deleted, and the New York Times reports that it was able to view a portion of the Facebook user data that still exists. The contract that Kogan initially had with Cambridge Analytica also allowed him to keep a copy of the data he scrapped for his research.","Kogan claimed in an email to Cambridge Analytica in 2014 that the data he was collecting would be able to predict a person’s neuroticism, political views, agreeableness, and interests in things like militarism, horoscopes, and the environment. These data points could be what Cambridge Analytica is referring to when it claims that it’s capable of psychologically targeting American voters.","“Without Facebook, we wouldn’t have won,” said Theresa Hong, a member of the digital arm of Trump’s presidential campaign, in an interview with the BBC last year when giving a tour of Trump’s digital campaign headquarters, dubbed Project Alamo, in San Antonio, Texas. Alamo was the name of the dataset used by Cambridge Analytica, according to Hong, who said Cambridge Analytica shared offices with the Trump campaign’s digital efforts and confirmed Facebook and Google sent liaisons to their offices to help Trump’s campaign. Hong showed the BBC how Cambridge Analytica could identify if, say, it was targeting a working mother concerned about childcare: She probably wouldn’t be interested in “a war ridden destructive ad” popping up in her Facebook app, but might respond to something more “warm and fuzzy,” lacking Trump’s voice, Hong said. “It wasn’t uncommon to have about 35 to 45 thousand iterations of these types of ads everyday.”","Cambridge Analytica also bragged publicly about its use of data and voter modeling during the election, which sparked the interest of David Carroll, a professor at Parsons School of Design who studies media, data targeting, and campaigns. In January 2017, he requested under the U.K.’s data protection law to see if any of his personal data had been shipped to Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, based in London. Last year, Carroll learned that Cambridge Analytica had given him scores on a scale of 1 to 10 on certain hot-button political categories, like a “gun rights importance rank.” Based on these scores, he was ultimately listed as “unlikely” to vote Republican. On Friday, the same day Facebook moved to suspend Cambridge Analyica’s account, Carrol filed a legal claim in the U.K. to learn what the company did with his data and if it was handed to anyone else.","Cambridge Analytica was roped into Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election this past December when it requested to see employee emails, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The firm also may be in hot water with the Federal Election Commission, which has rules about how non-U.S. persons are allowed to work on political campaigns. Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, is British and many of the company’s employees were either European or Canadian.","On Saturday, Cambridge Analytica responded to Facebook’s allegations and the reports in the New York Times and Guardian, writing that Wylie was a contractor and not a founder of the company and claiming that all of the Facebook data provided by Kogan was erased as soon as the company learned it was obtained illegitimately.","This isn’t a spy movie. We’re a data analytics company doing research & analysis on commercial, public and data sets for clients 7/8","In his now-deleted Twitter thread, Facebook’s Stamos said that Kogan’s handing of Facebook user data to Cambridge Analytica wasn’t technically a breach, since he “didn’t break into any systems, bypass technical controls, or use a flaw in our system to gather more data than allowed.” All of which means Kogan took a startling amount of user data that he was permitted to take—even if he wasn’t supposed to hand it over to a voter-targeting operation after taking it. Other app developers may have harvested data from users in the way Krogan and Cambridge Analytica did under Facebook’s old rules, too, and there’s no telling where that data might have ended up. Since 2015, Facebook has changed its policies, limiting the amount of user data third-party apps can siphon from the network—although it still allows sophisticated political targeting through its advertising platform, the kind which the Trump campaign was able to use, likely abetted by the Cambridge Analytica data set. None of this is surprising, of course, but it should be galling. Facebook’s primary job is making money, after all—and even careful policies can’t always control for the scrupulousness of how its customers use its primary product: our data.","Correction, March 19, 2018: This article originally misspelled the name of the platform Mechanical Turk."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Now. - The Washington Post","text":["Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg need to come clean about 2016. Now.","Over the weekend, the New York Times and the Observer of London posted a blockbuster investigative piece revealing that Cambridge Analytica, the firm brought on by the Trump campaign to target voters online, used the data of tens of millions of people obtained from Facebook without proper disclosures or permission.","In the wake of this report, it’s more than past time for Mark Zuckerberg to testify to Congress about Facebook’s role in the 2016 elections and why he believes existing privacy laws are adequate to protect Americans from misuse and abuse of technology platforms.","And I mean Mark Zuckerberg. Not a Facebook lawyer, like the one the company sent to Congress last year for hearings on how fake news swamped tech platforms such as, oh, Facebook. As Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) tweeted:","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The investigation published by the Times revealed that Cambridge Analytica, after receiving $15 million from conservative donor Robert Mercer in 2014 to micro-target voters, obtained the information to do so in a questionable way. A British professor collected the information from Facebook, saying he was conducting an academic personality study. He did get the approval of about 270,000 people who signed up to take part in the study — they were told their information would be used. He did not, however, get the permission of the users’ friends, whose information was also gathered — an estimated 50 million people.","It’s not just that such an action is unethical. It might well be a violation of an agreement Facebook made with the federal government. Two former employees of the Federal Trade Commission have now told The Post that it’s quite possible that Facebook violated a 2011 agreement with the agency to notify and offer users an out when there is an effort to use their personal information in a way not in line with their privacy settings. This agreement was reached after consumer groups complained that Facebook was cavalier with personal information.","So back to Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook found out, courtesy of a 2015 piece in the Guardian, that Cambridge Analytica and British academics had information on many users that agreed to such a collection, it demanded the information be destroyed. This did not happen. Facebook cited this when pressed on the latest revelations by the Times, claiming that the companies that misused the data “certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","(On Monday afternoon, Facebook announced that Cambridge Analytica agreed to a digital audit to prove it destroyed the disputed materials. The professors involved in using the data also agreed to an audit.)","And so, after the Times published its piece, Facebook didn’t own up to what happened. Instead, Facebook executives have gotten into a multiplespats with reporters and others over whether the Cambridge Analytica incident is a “breach” or a mere misuse of personal information, since some (but not all!) the people whose data was involved did give permission for their data to be taken and the company was not actually hacked. Facebook’s motive for this is almost certainly legal and regulatory. As Bloomberg News notes, a “breach” is a specific term that requires the company to notify users their information was illegally accessed.","But there is quite possibly a bigger motive. Painting Cambridge Analytica as the villain is an attempt to get Facebook off the hook for its ongoing role in everything from other invasions of privacy (more about that in a moment) to the ongoing complaints about its role in spreading fake news in the 2016 elections. If one or two rogue companies such as Cambridge Aanlytica — and not Facebook — are responsible for this mass misuse of data, perhaps the company can say more regulation is not needed.","But don’t fall for the idea that Facebook is not the problem. This is hardly a first-time offense for Facebook, which — a reminder — allowed fake news to flood many users’ news feeds in the months leading up to the 2016 elections.","In fact, Washington perhaps should have gotten interested in Facebook well before the Trump election contretemps. Over time, Facebook has indulged in numerous instances of dodgy behavior. There was the time Facebook altered news feeds to study whether they could affect the mood of people on the platform. There was the reveal that its platform permitted ad buyers to target people with such delightful terms as “jew hater.” And the discovery that Facebook made it possible to target housing ads to whites only.","Whether this latest scandal was a breach or a misuse of information is irrelevant. It was wrong. Zuckerberg needs to explain — slowly and clearly and without legal terminology or whiny excuses — what went wrong at the company he founded in his Harvard dorm room, and what steps the company is taking to make sure it never happens again. My suspicion? He can’t do that. Instead, a Zuckerberg appearance will demonstrate the need for significant federal regulation of large technology platforms.

Facebook can continue to deliver their service to you and send you advertising. The difference is that it will be much harder for Facebook to use your activity collected off Facebook to send you ads and other targeted messages [emphasis added].\"","Mozilla introduced the container concept to mainstream Firefox users in September when it rolled out \"Firefox Multi-Account Containers,\" a company-made add-on. In a way somewhat similar to how Firefox - and other browsers - isolate one tab from others to block app- or system-wide exploits, these containers insulate cookies generated by one site from those produced by other websites. (Normally, all cookies are stored in one memory location by the browser; Mozilla's extension sets up multiple \"cookie jars,\" or storage locations, and thus prevents one site from recognizing and reading cookies recorded by other URLs.)","\"If used carefully, Containers can prevent tracking. If a site is only opened in one Container, cookies set on that container cannot follow the user to other sites visited in non-container tabs or other containers,\" Mozilla stated in a backgrounder about the technology.","Facebook Container is, at root, a customized version of the earlier add-on, as Mozilla explained in another, albeit unsigned, blog post Tuesday.","\"When you install this extension, it will delete your Facebook cookies and log you out of Facebook,\" the company noted. \"The next time you visit Facebook it will open in a new blue-colored browser tab (aka 'container tab'). In that tab you can login to Facebook and use it like you normally would. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\"","Mozilla","Facebook Container signals it's active by shading the name of the service, as well as drawing a thin blue line under the tab.","Facebook has been under renewed scrutiny because of allegations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, illegally collected and retained the data of more than 50 million Facebook users. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an investigation into Facebook's practices, and Zuckerberg will answer questions from at least one congressional committee, according to the New York Times","But while Mozilla capitalized on the turn against Facebook among some users - evidence highlighted by the #deletefacebook campaign - it admitted that the Container add-on would not have helped in the latest instance. \"The type of data in the recent Cambridge Analytica incident would not have been prevented by Facebook Container,\" acknowledged Mozilla's Nguyen. \"But troves of data are being collected on your behavior on the Internet, and so giving users a choice to limit what they share in a way that is under their control is important.\"","Elsewhere, Mozilla pointed out the downsides of adding Facebook Container to Firefox. Among the issues with Facebook: Users may not be able to log in to other sites or accounts with their Facebook credentials, and \"Like\" buttons offered by non-Facebook websites will not work.","The Facebook Container can be downloaded and installed into Firefox from this page of the Firefox Add-ons market.","Mozilla has long touted its browser as the best choice for the privacy minded, with the pitch's credibility dependent, at least in part, on the fact that unlike Google (and its Chrome), Mozilla's business model does not directly rely on monetizing user data via targeted ads. (Mozilla certainly indirectly leans on just that; the bulk of its revenue comes from setting Google as Firefox's default search engine.) The open-source developer repeated the privacy talking points as it rolled out Facebook Container.","\"This add-on offers a solution that doesn't tell users to simply stop using a service that they get value from,\" Nguyen said. \"Instead, it gives users tools that help them protect themselves from the unexpected side effects of their usage.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

From their post:","In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc….","It’s all okay, though. Facebook makes app writers promise not to misuse the information Facebook gives them — and promised not to share it with other people. So what could possibly go wrong?","Well, for one thing some naughty app developers might break their promises and develop malicious apps. I know, I know, hard to imagine! Apparently Facebook wasn’t particularly concerned about this, because they didn’t build in any safeguards at all.","Move fast and break things!","Unsurprisingly, some app developers did develop malicious apps — like the aforementioned Dr. Kogan and Joseph Chancellor, founders of the company called Global Science Research (GSR). [Kogan also worked for St. Petersburg University.] Their app claimed to be for an academic research study but they were actually passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. In late 2015, after the Guardianreported that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, Facebook promised to “carefully investigate this situation.” Facebook also hired Chancellor, and he apparently still works there.","In August 2016 Facebook told Cambridge Analytica that they were in violation of the terms of service and should delete the data. Since Cambridge Analytica had already shown that they’d break the rules, you’d think that Facebook would have checked to see if they actually did delete it, but according to Chris Wylie, “literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it.” Once again, what could possibly go wrong?","So now, Facebook is shocked, shocked to receive reports that (gasp) “contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted.” But it wasn’t a data breach! And it wasn’t their fault!!!!!!","The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information …","Really? I really doubt that most of the people downloading the app, after being told it was a research project, were told the information would be used by a corporation to influence election results. I’m 100% sure that their 50,000,000 friends didn’t even have the opportunity to consent. As Zyenep Tufecki says in Facebook’s Surveillance Machine, “This wasn’t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.” It’s almost like Facebook’s blaming the victims and trying to turn the focus away from their own culpability.","Similarly,","We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.","Who could have predicted that people who violated trust and the commitments they made would do so again? It reminds me of the classic line from Animal House: “You fucked up. You trusted us.”","Anyhow, Facebook assures us that they are “committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information”. So they’re going to close the barn door.","We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","That’ll show ’em!","Good question. I mean, Facebook’s terms of service don’t permit it, so doing that would be an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments Cambridge Analytica made. That hasn’t stopped them in the past, but who knows, maybe third time’s a charm? The again, maybe not … Wylie, who should know, says “rules don’t matter to them”.*","For close elections like Brexit and the US Presidential election, this could have been a decisive edge.**","Mark Zuckerberg ended his “reflective” post-election post in November 2016 by saying “In my experience, people are good, and even if you may not feel that way today, believing in people leads to better results over the long term.” Move fast and break democracy!","Yeah really. Zuckerberg obviously didn’t understand how callous that sounded to immigrants who are being deported and fear being kidnapped on the streets, Muslims who are banned from visiting the US, trans people who have lost their right to medical care, the targets of the upsurge in neo-Nazi and alt-right violence, and all the other people who are directly impacted by the result of the election. Privileged much?","Then again, I can see why Zuckerberg would say that. Remember back in 2007 when he was apologizing for Facebook violating people’s privacy with Beacon and talked about how they had learned that people need to control what they share? There have been a lot more privacy violations, andapologies,*** since then … and yet, he’s now worth about sixty bazillion dollars, and until recently was acting like he was thinking of running for President. So yeah, people believing Facebook and trusting it with their data have certainly led to better results for Zuckerberg.","And that’s all just in the first few days. This story isn’t going away — as Kara Swisher says, it’s going to be a long and winding road.***** With all the attention on Trump/Russia and Brexit, there’s going to be plenty of publicity on this — and plenty of politicians, journalists, lawyers, media companies, and potential competitors eager to jump on the bandwagon of criticizing Facebook. As Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg says","We have a responsibility to protect your data — and if we can’t, then we don’t deserve to serve you.","So let’s hope Marcy Wheeler’s right, and Facebook is well and truly fucked.","Originally written March 17Updated March 18–25, adding new links, moving info to footnotes to improve flow, and other minor edits.","**** From a liability perspective, Facebook has good reasons for it not to be considered a breach: if it is, they’ve probably broken the law in many of the 48 states that have some kinds of breach notification laws; and EU regulations could expose them to a hefty fine.

Clearly, we don’t want people to be uninformed and uneducated, but consent and education in themselves are not a panacea.","Second, the challenge of achieving a fair value exchange goes much deeper than most people yet realise. Fairness and value aren’t just about what happens within existing relationships between individuals and organisations; it also involves realising the potentially huge personal and social benefits of data – potential which so far remains largely untapped and unleashed. The data economy won’t be seen to be truly fair until individuals can get as much value from using their data as organisations.","Third, there’s a potentially vast gulf between regulations written with the right intentions and the right sort of regulation. Ill-designed regulations create farces like the European cookie laws. Tick box compliance is not half as good as regulations that encourage and incentivize companies to achieve goals regulators want them to achieve.","Fourth, there’s growing need for leadership. Big global brands grew to be big and global because they could be trusted. They need to accept responsibility for building trust across the data-driven economy. (By the way, the last two points mean that both businesses and regulators may need to rethink some long-standing assumptions and positions if we are to make real progress.)","Finally, whatever we do, the policies and practices we implement need to be designed for real people, not for mythical beings who are always ‘rational’, who always instantly absorb and understand all available information there is about a subject, and then always make the right, considered, informed decision.","In our current data economy two simple, basic, and pivotal things need to be achieved. People need to feel the status quo is safe. (Currently, they don’t). And they need to experience the full upside potential of using their own data for personal and social purposes. it’s a win-win-win for individuals, society and business if this happens.","Clearly, if we are to build a sustainable, flourishing data-driven economy, a lot more needs to be done."],"isopubdate":""}

The company just announced that it will end a feature called Partner Categories, launched back in 2013 out of a partnership between Facebook and major data brokers.","Third party data helps Facebook further atomize its user base into meaningful segments for advertisers. As TechCrunch explained when the data partnership first launched:","“Through new partnerships with top online and offline purchase data providers Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai, Facebook is now allowing advertisers to target hashed lists of existing and potential customers, and categories like role-playing gamers or soda drinkers.”","Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that the change is permanent, not a temporary precaution. In order to leverage the deep pool of data Facebook collects on users, the company mixes information that it obtains from users themselves (Pages a user liked, for instance) with information from advertisers (membership status in a loyalty program, for example) and with data obtained from third party providers.","While Facebook feels comfortable with the integrity of its data sourcing within the first two categories, it feels less settled about dipping into these aggregate pools of third party data.","The decision comes at the same time that Facebook is facing a lot of scrutiny and ire over third-party data mishandling. But it is also coming ahead of GDPR regulations and the ePrivacy Directive both coming into effect in Europe, which were already leading to the company making changes to its privacy policies, even before the Cambridge Analytica scandal even came to light.","Facebook Product Marketing Director Graham Mudd elaborated on the decision in a statement:","“We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories. This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.”","Facebook clarified that it will still work with companies like Experian and Acxiom in order to measure ad performance and provide metrics, although it will also be conducting a review of those ongoing relationships. Facebook may also move toward sharing data in a shared server environment in order to offer further assurances of user privacy. As Mudd noted, the program will be discontinued in the coming months."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.","Cambridge Analytica boasts of dirty tricks to swing elections","Read more","The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analyticato determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.","The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.","The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unlikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.","On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.","“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.","The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.","Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.","Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.","Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.","Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”","The Times reported that Stamos’ responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August.","“Alex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.”","Stamos is one of a small handful of Facebook executives who addressed the data harvesting scandal on Twitter over the weekend while Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said nothing."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The problem is federal laws may have been broken. #Tucker","Controversy continues to swirl around how the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica obtained personal data from over 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge and used it to target ads to individuals in an effort to help Donald Trump be elected president in 2016.","But a more serious case of apparent misconduct involves Facebook data going to a different presidential campaign – this time in 2012. In this case, which is getting far less attention, Facebook reportedly voluntarily provided data on millions of its users to the re-election campaign of President Obama.","If true, such action by Facebook may constitute a major violation of federal campaign finance law as an illegal corporate campaign contribution. The matter should be investigated by the Federal Election Commission – an agency I am quite familiar with, because I served as one of its commissioners from 2006 to 2007. The commission enforces campaign finance laws for congressional and presidential elections.","A federal law bans corporations from making “direct or indirect” contributions to federal candidates. That ban extends beyond cash contributions to “any services, or anything of value.” In other words, corporations cannot provide federal candidates with free services of any kind. Under the Federal Election Commission’s regulations, “anything of value” includes any “in-kind contribution.”","Whether or not the Obama campaign and Facebook violated this ban is an open question. It should be investigated by the Federal Election Commission and potentially the U.S. Department of Justice.","For example, if a corporation decided to offer a presidential candidate free office space, that would violate federal law. Corporations can certainly offer their services, including office space, to federal campaigns. But the campaigns are required to pay the fair market value for such services or rental properties.","According to Carol Davidsen, the former media director for Obama for America, Facebook gave the 2012 Obama campaign direct access to the personal data of Facebook users in violation of its internal rules, making a special exception for the campaign. The Daily Mail, a British newspaper, reported that Davidsen saidon Twitter March 18 that Facebook employees came to the campaign office and “were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.”","The type of data that the Obama campaign was mining from Facebook is a more sophisticated version of the type of data that has long been provided by professional direct mail marketers – something pioneered by Richard Viguerie. Viguerie, for example, has detailed personal data on “12 million conservative donors and activists” to whom his company sends letters and emails on behalf of his clients. He provides information to campaigns looking for votes and money, and to nonprofit and advocacy organizations raising funds.","Political campaigns must pay for these services. Under a Federal Election Commission regulation, giving a mailing list or something similar to a campaign is considered an “in-kind contribution.”","So if Facebook gave the Obama campaign free access to this type of data when it normally does not do so for other entities – or usually charges for such access – then Facebook would appear to have violated the federal ban on in-kind contributions by a corporation. And the Obama campaign may have violated the law by accepting such a corporate contribution.","What about the story currently in the news about Cambridge Analytica using Facebook data for the Trump campaign? The important legal distinction may be in the way the data were obtained. Fox News reported that the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica to do political research on voters and reportedly to “help the campaign target specific voters with ads and stories.”","The real controversy now involving the Trump campaign deals with exactly how Cambridge Analytica obtained the data it used for the campaign. A CNBC report says that Cambridge Analytica bought the data from Aleksandr Kogan and his company, Global Science Research, which obtained the data through an app and a psychological test taken by Facebook users.","The amounts paid by the Trump campaign to Cambridge Analytica for its services – and the use of the Facebook data – are listed in its spending reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. This proves that the Trump campaign paid for services in the same way that campaigns routinely hire and pay direct mail marketers. So the Trump campaign did not get an illegal corporate contribution from Cambridge Analytica or Facebook when it received free access to very valuable data.","Whether or not Global Science Research and Cambridge Analytica violated any Facebook rules regarding this data is not the responsibility of the Trump campaign. From the standpoint of federal campaign finance law, the Trump campaign met its obligation to pay for and report this spending and did not violate the ban on corporate contributions.","However, whether or not the Obama campaign and Facebook violated this ban is an open question. It should be investigated by the Federal Election Commission and potentially the U.S. Department of Justice. The commission handles most routine violations of the law, which are civil matters. The Justice Department is responsible for investigating knowing and intentional violations of the law, which are criminal matters.","Although the statute of limitations may have already run out on this conduct by the Obama campaign, one thing seems certain: Carol Davidsen’s admissions should provide a sufficient basis for opening a federal investigation of what may have been a serious violation of the law by the Obama campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}
{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2FZdgCf?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.755c166b1bed","title":"U.S. and British lawmakers demand answers from Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg - The Washington Post","text":["Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are calling on Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how the names, preferences and other information from tens of millions of users ended up in the hands of a data analysis firm connected with President Trump's 2016 campaign.","The demands came in response to news reports Saturday about how the firm, Cambridge Analytica, used a feature once available to Facebook app developers to collect information on 270,000 people and, in the process, gain access to data on tens of millions of their Facebook “friends” — few, if any, of whom had given explicit permission for this sharing.","Though both companies have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either nation.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

If recent technical patterns are any indication, however, naptime is about to end, and FB stock is going to pop.","Facebook Stock Charts","At $185, Facebook shares are virtually unchanged since last November. That’s five months of churn that has frustrated both bulls and bears alike. But as any good chart reader will attest, periods of volatility compression are often followed by expansion. When strong-trending stocks settle into a range, smart traders watch for signs that volatility is returning. A recent downturn on news that user data was poorly handled could spark a longer downtrend, but Facebook is still a strong company.","Think of FB as a coiled spring, quietly collecting energy for a breakout. The level to watch is $186. It has halted the past three rebounds and is about to be tested yet again.","The pair of higher pivot lows that just formed suggest buying aggression is on the rise. Couple that with the potential for more strength from the Nasdaq next week and I think an upside break is highly likely.

At 25%, the implied volatility rank (not shown) for FB options is low and likely close to troughing.","That’s because right now, we sit directly between earnings announcements. The last release was about six weeks ago, and the next one will arrive six weeks from now.

While we believe there is still more to learn, we found that its current default settings leave access open to a lot of data – particularly with respect to settings for third party apps.”","It is also running a petition calling for Facebook to lock down app permission settings to ensure users’ privacy is “protected by default”, saying the current default settings “leave a lot of questions and a lot of data flying around”.","“Facebook’s current app permissions leave billions of its users vulnerable without knowing it,” it writes. “If you play games, read news or take quizzes on Facebook, chances are you are doing those activities through third-party apps and not through Facebook itself.

This latest Facebook privacy debacle, where the data of 50 million users was shared without consent, with political marketing consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, may be the final straw. That seemingly little thing, that most people don’t really think too much about, consent, is raising its head above the virtual parapet and making people sit up and take notice. But why is capturing consent such a big deal anyway? I mean, if you don’t have anything to hide why does it matter who uses your personal data?","Why consent is a big deal","Consent is part of a wider act that human beings rely on to keep our daily lives and relationships ticking along - this being, trust. Trust is something that identity systems, in particular, need to use as part of the design remit of the system. You may well have heard of Privacy by Design and Security by Design, but we now need to consider including Trust by Design (TbD). Using a TbD ethos will be highly beneficial to an organization that embraces the tenets of trust. When your design remit includes trust, you design to add in respect; and, relationships that are respectful are much more likely to build (brand) loyalty.","Consent is an integral part of building a relationship based on trust. When you design a system that has consent at the heart of data sharing, you are signaling to the user “I respect you and your personal data enough to ask your permission to use it.”","This sentiment is also at the heart of the GDPR which states from the outset that:","“The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind.“ Recital 4 GDPR","This is a grand statement, but one that should be echoed in our choices of how we deliver modern IAM.","CIAM is not a monolith – containers, privacy and mass adopted identity systems","The practical implications of building a system based on trust means that you need to look at the architecture of the solution. IAM and solution architects are at a juncture. We need to focus on building effective and robust environments that service and secure mass adopted digital identities of customers and employees alike. But, this new world order of Identity Access Management and Customer IAM (CIAM) relies heavily on personal data and the subset of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to perform tasks including targeted marketing. Large scale CIAM systems are complex. They require a massive amount of upfront work to choose the right environment that can handle a complex mix of variables:","Improved performance, especially in systems where loads are difficult to predict","Efficient resource utilization","Wide-demographic challenges","Authentication challenges","DevSecOps friendly","Security across all of the layers of the platform","Privacy enhancement and minimal disclosure/data capture","To name but a few...","Container technology is one of the fastest emerging technologies that could hold the key to better performance and scalable identity systems, as well as being DevOps friendly.","However, container technology uptake has been slower than hoped with only 25% of organizations implementing containers in 2017. Gartner placed containersecurity as one of the top ten technologies in 2017, indicating that security of data may be the hurdle to container adoption.","This security concern may be holding back an important leap forward in application deployment. In large-scale systems like social platforms and CIAM; containers are a very attractive way of handling mass scalability, performance, and responsiveness but without security they fall short of the mark. Containers, for example, can persist vulnerabilities in images as they are deployed.","Another area that needs close attention is the secure use of credentials when provisioning containers. Facebook, has their own blend of container known as ‘Tupperware’; however, the most popular container technology is Docker.","Treating systems like social media and identity platforms as monoliths constrains their capability. Container technology, like Docker and Tupperware, within a micro-services architecture, offer the type of responsiveness that CIAM platforms need. But in the light of raised awareness of data privacy, created by the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica revelations, and the earlier Snowden/NSA case, we have to build container-based architectures that fold security and privacy into the solution architecture as a whole. Getting your head around containers, and then how to secure container-based data, is something IAM architects will need to figure out.","And then there was the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)","Getting the solution architecture correct for a mass adopted system such as a Customer IAM platform, will also give you GDPR kudos. The GDPR places consent as the pivot upon which data subject rights turn. If you can start off by designing trust into your architecture, it will naturally enable user journeys based on consent. By creating a solution architecture where trust is your basis, you will tick many GDPR compliance boxes and help to enable the adherence of many more.","Modern IAM and CIAM platforms need to be highly responsive and scalable. Containers are a solution to this. But containers need to be part of an overall ethos of trust, that filters through from design to architecture to implementation. Facebook may have dropped the baton of privacy, but we can all learn from this and create identity platforms that are trustworthy and build relationships, not destroy them.","This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

Election campaigns of political parties and candidates employ a wide variety of strategies and tactics to influence voters. The digital era has added a whole new flavour, be it the eye-catching colossal digital campaigns or instances of foreign governments interfering in the electoral process. Last year, the Presidential elections in both the US and France were controversial due to hacking incidents and data leaks at the campaigns of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and En Marche, respectively. In general, cyber means of intervention appear to be becoming an inevitable part of the electoral process. The Cambridge Analytica incident proves that India is no exception to this trend. During the next general elections in 2019, the Election Commission of India has an uphill task to thwart both external interference and the abuse of social media platforms to influence voter behaviour.","While there is a long history of external interference in elections both through covert and overt means, digital platforms add a new dimension. News and online content over digital platforms can spread at lightning speed, without paying heed to the credibility or authenticity of the source. Moreover, social media platforms generate vast amounts of data related to the socio-economic conditions, purchasing behaviour, interests, hobbies, and political inclinations or orientations of the users. These details are captured and treasured for commercial purposes. Business analytics feed on this data to generate business intelligence and derive monetary benefits for informed decision making. Present day electoral campaigns are also data driven and they are well-funded to let the campaigners harness data for their own political advantage. Data analytics tools can harvest data from user profiles and sift through the trove to support research, augment targeted campaigns and help political parties in assessing and evaluating their performance. These have been quite effective in targeting swing voters and behaviour forecasting.","As the popularity of social media platforms hits new heights, Facebook and Twitter in particular have been under the scanner of both intelligence agencies and election watchdogs. With close to 2.2 billion active users (by the end of 2017), Facebook alone sits on a stockpile of data which could be used to drive election campaigns towards any preferred outcome. Data in itself is worthless, but data science and the corresponding analytical tools turn it into a goldmine for both businesses and political strategists in the digital age.","Cambridge Analytica, the London-based political consultancy firm presently under the scanner, has an eight-year-old association with Indian elections. It undertook an in-depth electorate analysis for the Bihar Assembly Election in 2010 and, as per the case study details on its website, “the client (political party) achieved a landslide victory, with over 90 percent of total seats targeted by Cambridge Analytica being won.”1 This was carried out through Ovleno Business Intelligence, which is an Indian affiliate of Cambridge Analytica’s parent firm Strategic Communications Laboratories. The firm had hit media headlines for its association with Donald Trump’s election campaign, which it has referred to as “A Full-Scale Data-Driven Digital Campaign”. Bringing together the expertise of data scientists, researchers, strategists and content writers in three integrated teams (research, data science, and digital marketing), Cambridge Analytica’s campaign helped Trump win the elections.2 The above case studies, mentioned in the Cambridge Analytica website, are prime examples of the vital role data science has begun to play especially in devising techniques to change voter behaviour in the targeted population or audience.","Facebook has played a central role in this entire episode. In a statement, Facebook has accepted that in 2015 a research app for psychologists with the name “thisisyourdigitallife”, developed by a psychology professor at Cambridge University, was used for commercial purposes by Cambridge Analytica and other firms in violation of its platform policies. The app, meant for personality prediction, had around 270,000 downloads. Users revealed content related to their likes, preferences, and their own social circles according to their privacy settings.3 The access to Facebook content, in technical terms, was legitimate and through proper channels but the information was passed on to third parties likes Cambridge Analytica and Eunoia Technologies, which exploited it for commercial gains. However, Cambridge Analytica has outright denied allegations of using Facebook data as part of the services rendered to the Trump presidential campaign and while working on the Brexit referendum in the UK.4","As of January 2018, with 250 million users, India is the largest user-base for Facebook. It is also an important tool for the government to take forward its flagship programmes to the wider populace. Facebook is one of the top contenders for partnering with the government’s societal development and digital inclusion plans. The Election Commission of India had also partnered with Facebook in 2017, launching a nationwide voter registration campaign.5 Indian users, paying little regard to the privacy terms and condition of social media platforms, uninhibitedly share images, pictures and other content, and are extremely vulnerable to the tools, techniques and campaigns devised for influencing both commercial and political behaviour. Against this backdrop, the government’s concerns have been raised by Cambridge Analytica’s alleged mining of data from the profiles of 50 million US Facebook users without their consent.6 If such an incident were to occur in India, it would constitute a serious violation of the IT Act. Not just in India, Cambridge Analytica is also at loggerheads with the Electoral Commission in the UK over its alleged role in the BREXIT vote and in Europe for violating EU privacy laws in collusion with Facebook.","Although Facebook has tendered an assurance of data security on its platform for the upcoming elections in India (2019) and Brazil (October 2018), the incident has caused severe damage to its reputation even as a development partner for governments in digital inclusion or other societal benefits plans. As the stakes in elections go up, political parties are unlikely to shy away from leveraging the technical expertise of data analytical firms like Cambridge Analytica fed with expansive data sets harvested from prominent social media platforms.","Data is being extensively harvested and harnessed for commercial purposes, targeted marketing campaigns and to influence consumer choices. It is ethically and legally controversial when information derived without the consent of the users or through dubious means is leveraged to influence political choices. Flourishing in the void of effective legal and regulatory regimes, such incidents seriously undermine the trust of people in the democratic process. To an extent, users understanding the perils of sharing unwanted details or content on social media platforms and aware of their privacy settings is pertinent for containing such instances of abuse. For India, as a functioning democracy, the Cambridge Analytica episode highlights the need to expedite the process of developing a data protection framework and probably amend the IT Act in accordance with the changing realities of cyberspace. The earlier this is realised, the better it would be for the healthy functioning of our democratic systems and processes.","Views expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the IDSA or of the Government of India."],"isopubdate":""}

Republicans paid $345,000 to the data-mining company that’s now banned from Facebook","WASHINGTON — North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and the state’s Republican Party paid $345,000 to a data company that is now under scrutiny for its use of personal information about Facebook users.","Cambridge Analytica used the personal Facebook data of more than 50 million users, acquired through a third party, to create profiles of prospective voters and “microtarget” persuasive voting messages to them, according to a whistleblower who told his story to The Guardian and The New York Times.","Cambridge Analytica also worked for the Donald Trump campaign, earning more than $5.9 million in 2016 according to Federal Election Commission filings, and for the “Brexit” campaign in the United Kingdom.","Two years earlier, the data company helped Tillis, a Republican, defeat Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan by 1.7 points. It was at the time the most expensive U.S. Senate race in history with total spending of more than $121 million.","Cambridge Analytica put a page about Tillis’ race on its website, touting its work and listing the race as a case study.","“Our telecanvassing program contacted 123,138 individuals, resulting in an increase in turnout of 12.57% among those called, which is equivalent to over 15,478 voters,” Cambridge Analytica says.","Tillis won by 48,511 votes.","Cambridge Analytica’s data told Tillis to highlight Hagan’s absences on the Senate Armed Services Committee to reach a certain group of voters. Tillis hammered Hagan in ads and debates on her absences and the rise of ISIS and jumped on her acknowledgement that she skipped a national security meeting to attend a fundraiser.","“We were able to design and deploy messages tailored to these audiences according to their particular psychographic profiles. This was done through a telecanvassing program and a large scale direct mail campaign that demonstrably increased their likelihood of voting, and voting Republican,” Cambridge Analytica said on its site.","Tillis’ campaign committee paid the firm $10,000 on Oct. 21, 2014, and $20,000 on Nov. 6, 2014. It made four payments of $25,000 throughout 2015 to Cambridge Analytica, according to FEC filings. The payments were for “microtargeting.”","Tillis declined to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica on Capitol Hill on Monday evening. Tillis campaign consultant Paul Shumaker would not comment for this story.","“It gives you an edge in increasing the probability that voters would pay attention to your message,” Shumaker said of Cambridge Analytica’s work for the campaign in an interview with Bloomberg in 2015.","In a statement emailed to a Winston-Salem Journal reporter Tuesday morning, Tillis said Cambridge Analytica was no longer a vendor for his campaign.","“Cambridge Analytica was one of many vendors that provided limited services during my campaign. However, they were not our digital vendor and they have ceased to be a vendor for my campaign for more than three years. My expectation is that all services provided to my campaign are lawful — regardless of who provides them, including third parties. If we were misled by a vendor, that would be deeply disturbing.”","Steve Bannon, later a top aide to Trump, formerly served as the vice president of Cambridge Analytica and billionaire GOP donor Robert Mercer funded it, the Guardian reported.","Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica from its site Friday and said that a Cambridge University professor “passed data from an app” to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook’s policies. The information was legally obtained by the app from its users, Facebook said.","The app paid users to take a personality test, the Guardian reported, but also collected data on those users’ Facebook friends.","The professor also works at St. Petersburg State University and received grants from Russia.","“In 2014 we received Facebook data and derivatives of Facebook data from another company, (app maker) GSR, that we engaged in good faith to legally supply data for research. After it subsequently became known that GSR had broken its contract with Cambridge Analytica because it had not adhered to data protection regulation, Cambridge Analytica deleted all the Facebook data and derivatives, in cooperation with Facebook,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement.","Facebook is investigating Cambridge Analytica’s claims that all the data was deleted, the social media giant said.","“This Facebook data was not used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump presidential campaign; personality targeted advertising was not carried out for this client either. The company has made this clear since 2016.”","The North Carolina Republican Party paid Cambridge Analytica $215,000 in 2014 and 2015, according to the Federal Elections Commission. The payments were “microtargeting consulting fees.”","Dallas Woodhouse, the NC GOP’s executive director, said the company was one of many hired to work on direct mail. Woodhouse said he could not find a contract the party signed with the company.","Cambridge Analytica did not do social media work for the party, said Woodhouse, who was hired as state executive director in September 2015.","Even though federal filings show a June 2015 payment to the company of more than $57,000, Woodhouse said the company’s work for the party ended with the 2014 election cycle.","“There are no plans to use them again,” he said.","Rep. Patrick McHenry, a Republican from Denver in western North Carolina, paid Cambridge Analytica $15,000 for “polling and research” work in 2014, according to FEC filings. A spokesman for McHenry’s campaign couldn’t be reached Monday.","Wayne Goodwin, the chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, said the reports about Cambridge Analytica make him “wonder whether North Carolina was used as a trial run in 2014.”","Goodwin is also concerned about Russian ties to those involved in handling the data.","“Given we’re talking about foreign intervention in our national and state elections, it would seem highly reasonable for anybody to avoid using Cambridge Analytica,” he said. “There are too many unanswered questions, too much we don’t know yet.”","Get today’s top stories right in your inbox.

The companies ran data operations for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign. According to The Verge, the companies are widely credited with helping Trump more effectively target voters on Facebook than his rival Hillary Clinton.","“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, Aleksandr Kogan, lied to us and violated our platform policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica,” said Paul Grewal, Vice President and Deputy General Counsel at Facebook.","SCL/Cambridge Analytica is a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe, Grewal said. Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists”.","Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. “In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it,” Grewal said in a blog post late on Friday.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies,” Facebook said. When Facebook learned of this violation in 2015, it removed the app.","“Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data. But not all data was deleted,” said the social networking giant, adding that it is suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.

We can condemn this behaviour while being accurate in our description of it.”","And the social network updated its official statement on its suspension of Cambridge Analytica to reinforce that it had not suffered a breach.","But let’s try to think this through. In my opinion, the question of whether it’s a data breach or not depends on where you stand.","From Facebook’s point of view, it’s not a traditional data breach. That’s because this isn’t a case of malicious hackers breaking into a server, exploiting a vulnerability, or grabbing passwords.","This is how Facebook was designed to work, and many apps over the years have scooped up users’ information and (privacy settings permitting) those of their friends as well.","Hundreds of millions of times every day Facebook hones the content it displays to you based on what it has determined you are interested in, who you are, and what it thinks will be most effective. So, it’s not that different from what Cambridge Analytica did with the same access to the data.","What was against Facebook’s guidelines was for Aleksandr Kogan (the developer of the “thisisyourdigitallife” app) to share the data he captured with Cambridge Analytica. However, I don’t see how Facebook could have technically prevented that, other than doing what it already does - requesting third parties play by the rules.","In short, Facebook might try to argue this is not a data security breach, but rather a misappropriation of data, or (if you like) a data policy breach.","However, millions of Facebook users around the world might take a dimmer view of things.","Many of them may not realise that just because one of their Facebook friends allowed a personality test to scoop up their friends’ details, their own information may also have been exposed to and shared with third parties against their wishes.","None of this is news. Facebook has been working this way for years.","And the fact that this is how Facebook is supposed to work actually makes it worse than any data breach.","The only way to reduce your exposure is to refuse to play Facebook’s game and not be a member of the site. If you can’t bring yourself to leave, at the very least lock down your privacy settings and reduce the level of information that you share.","Finally, it’s worth saying, Facebook isn’t the only website that collects vast amounts of information about its users and exploits it in this fashion.","“If you are not paying for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold.”","About the author, Graham Cluley","Graham Cluley is a veteran of the anti-virus industry having worked for a number of security companies since the early 1990s when he wrote the first ever version of Dr Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit for Windows. Now an independent security analyst, he regularly makes media appearances and is an international public speaker on the topic of computer security, hackers, and online privacy.","Yes, I absolutely agree. Under GPDR, I am sure this would be a breach because all data subjects have to be informed what data is held, why and who it is shared with. They also have to have given explicit consent. I don’t see any way that Facebook could argue that people could have given explicit consent just by virtue of being friended with the main data subject.","Under the new law, Cambridge Analytica would be a Data Processor and Facebook would be the Data Controller and would have the ultimate legal culpability for any data breach. If the ICO investigates this and finds that Cambridge Analytica did commit a breach, Facebook can count themselves lucky that this did not happen after 25th May this year because after that, they could be fined up to 15% of global turnover.","Absolutely this is how Facebook works. The data they collect is for them to target adverts at you, and that’s how its meant to be used by third parties too.\nWhere the problem lies, is in the way a single person taking the ‘personality test’ was able to release the data of all their friends. That should not happen. Each person should have the say-so on whether their data is released. This is the crux of the matter.","In the end, everyone DOES have a say on whether their data is released. Each of these people signed up for facebook, answered all their questions, let them suck up their address book, collect their pictures and comments, their likes and dislikes and everything else, all in exchange for a few shiny Internet baubles. When anyone balked at it, these deep thinkers took the “what do you have to hide?” attitude. Well now, maybe, finally, they know.","Oh my goodness! Millions of folks’ privacy (and therefore their security) is now at risk because of the way Facebook operates. I’m shocked! </sarcasm> Not.","Exactly as the article points out, the possibility…no, wait — the near certainty that something like this could happen has been part and parcel of the way Facebook operates from the get-go. To anyone who has been paying attention, there’s no actual news here.","So why is this hogging the headlines now? Didn’t something like this happen back when Mr. Obama was seeking his second stint on the throne? Oh, wait…I forgot; the news media weren’t desperately, disingenuously, relentlessly, and tiresomely looking for some way to invalidate his election, as they are with Mr. Trump.","Until Facebook makes a radical and uncharacteristic change in their policies and suddenly stops exploiting FB users’ personal information in ways FB knows they never suspect (and would never agree to if they thought it through to the potentially disastrous consequences),\nthis will happen again.","And just as it has over the entirety of Facebook’s history, FB users won’t care, just as they have never cared that Mr. Zuckerberg once characterized them as “dumb f_cks”. He’s the poster boy for successful, legal (as distinct from moral) social engineering. He owes his billion$ to the accurate perception that vast numbers of people can’t resist the lure of telling the world about themselves in the vain hope that anyone cares.","It’s a tragicomic irony. The world is dominated by politicians who couldn’t care less about the sanctity of personal property and privacy, and who will say anything to buy the votes of their victims.","The only people who really care about what Facebook users post are the companies who buy that data. Zuckerberg makes his billions, and the people who provide the product (their information) don’t make a penny…and they still don’t care.","Graham’s advice is sound; bail out before you become the next victim. Alas, those who most need to follow that advice probably aren’t inclined to read a security newsletter in the first place.","Smashing Security podcast","Malicious script is being blamed for the British Airways hack, Trend Micro's apps are booted out of the Mac App Store for snaffling private data, and Paul Manafort's daughter wants Twitter to remove a link."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Obama was serving his first term as president. Google+ hadn’t arrived, let alone vanished again. Steve Jobs was still alive, as was Kim Jong Il. Facebook’s IPO hadn’t yet taken place, and its service was still fun to use—although it was littered with requests and demands from social games, like FarmVille and Pet Society.","I’d had enough of it—the click-farming games, for one, but also Facebook itself. Already in 2010, it felt like a malicious attention market where people treated friends as latent resources to be optimized. Compulsion rather than choice devoured people’s time. Apps like FarmVille sold relief for the artificial inconveniences they themselves had imposed.","In response, I made a satirical social game called Cow Clicker. Players clicked a cute cow, which mooed and scored a “click.” Six hours later, they could do so again. They could also invite friends’ cows to their pasture, buy virtual cows with real money, compete for status, click to send a real cow to the developing world from Oxfam, outsource clicks to their toddlers with a mobile app, and much more. It became strangely popular, until eventually, I shut the whole thing down in a bovine rapture—the “cowpocalypse.” It’s kind of a complicated story.","But one worth revisiting today, in the context of the scandal over Facebook’s sanctioning of user-data exfiltration via its application platform. It’s not just that abusing the Facebook platform for deliberately nefarious ends was easy to do (it was). But worse, in those days, it was hard to avoid extracting private data, for years even, without even trying. I did it with a silly cow game.","* * *","Cow Clicker is not an impressive work of software. After all, it was a game whose sole activity was clicking on cows. I wrote the principal code in three days, much of it hunched on a friend’s couch in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. I had no idea anyone would play it, although over 180,000 people did, eventually. I made a little money from the whole affair, but I never optimized it for revenue generation. I certainly never pondered using the app as a lure for a data-extraction con. I was just a strange man making a strange game on a lark.","And yet, if you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior. I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood, before my caprice raptured them into the digital void.","The authorization dialog for the game Candy Crush. (King / Facebook)","To understand why withdrawing data was the default behavior in Facebook apps, you have to know something about how apps get made and published on Facebook. In 2007, the company turned its social-network service into an application platform. The idea was that Facebook could grow its number of users and the time they spent engaged by allowing people and organizations to build services overtop of it. And those people and organizations would benefit by plugging into a large network of users, whose network of friends could easily be made a part of the service, both for social interaction and viral spread.","When you access an app on Facebook’s website, be it a personality-quiz, a game, a horoscope, or a sports community, the service presents you with an authorization dialog, where the specific data an app says it needs is displayed for the user’s consideration. That could be anything from your name, friend list, and email address, to your photos, likes, direct messages and more.","The information shared with an app by default has changed over time, and even a savvy user might never have known what comprised it. When I launched Cow Clicker in 2010, it was easier to acquire both “basic” information (name, gender, networks, and profile picture) and “extended” user information (location, relationship status, likes, posts, and more). In 2014, Facebook began an app review process for information beyond that which a user shared publicly, but for years before that, the decision was left to the user alone. This is consistent with Facebook’s longstanding, official policy on privacy, which revolves around user control rather than procedural verification.","App authorizations are not exceptionally clear. For one thing, the user must accept the app’s request to share data with it as soon as they open it for the first time, even before knowing what the app does or why. For another, the authorization is presented by Facebook, not by the third party, making it seem official, safe, and even endorsed.","Cow Clicker on Facebook, 2010. The game appears to live natively inside the Facebook interface, but it runs—and stores its data—on a separate server. (Cow Clicker / Ian Bogost / The Atlantic)","The part of the Facebook website where apps appear, under the blue top navigation (as seen above), introduces further confusion. To the average web user, especially a decade ago, it looked like the game or app was just a part of Facebook itself. The page is seamless, with no boundary between the site’s navigational chrome and the third-party app. If you look at the browser address bar while using a Facebook app on the website, the URL begins with “apps.facebook.com,” further cementing the impression that the user was safely ensconced in the comforting, blue cradle of Facebook’s care.","That’s not what really takes place. When a user loads an app, Facebook’s servers pass those requests to a remote computer, where the individual or company that made the app hosts their services. The app sends its responses to Facebook, which formats and presents them to the user, as if they were inside of Facebook itself.","The authorization process happens once, the first time the app is accessed for a specific user. After that, every time the user loads the app, Facebook sends it a payload of basic user data to facilitate the app’s operation (additional data can be requested separately when needed). For years, these transmissions were even conducted unencrypted, until Facebook required apps to communicate with its service over a secure connection.","Beyond its own terms of service for applications, which many developers probably didn’t read or feel compelled to heed, Facebook “secured” user data shared with third-parties by requiring every app to publish a privacy policy. Because data sharing was seen as a form of user-control, not corporate policy, Facebook doesn’t appear to review platform-developer privacy policies. As far as I can tell, all the platform did was to insure that accessing the URL for an app’s privacy policy didn’t result in a page-not-found error. Facebook was checking that privacy policies existed as reachable web pages, not that they existed as privacy policies, let alone policies that provided any specific protections. And besides, users probably never read the policies, which were linked unassumingly from the application-permissions interface. They might easily, and reasonably, have assumed that Facebook was simply reiterating its own privacy policy when presenting new access to an app. They would have been wrong.","In essence, Facebook was presenting apps as quasi-endorsed extensions of its core service to users who couldn’t have been expected to know better. That might explain why so many people feel violated by Facebook this week—they might never have realized that they were even using foreign, non-Facebook applications in the first place, let alone ones that were siphoning off and selling their data. The website always just looked like Facebook.","In the case of Cow Clicker, which only ever aimed to let people click on pictures of cows, I was able to access two potentially sensitive pieces of data without even trying.","The first is a player’s Facebook ID. This is a numeric, unique identifier attached to every Facebook account. Once I have your Facebook ID, I can look up your profile programmatically, or I can just load it in the public website by appending it to “facebook.com”—Mark Zuckerberg’s is 4.","These days, Facebook generates a unique, app-specific ID for each user, in order to prevent an app from connecting someone directly to Facebook profiles. But back in Cow Clicker’s heyday of 2010, Facebook didn’t do this, and every app got your actual ID. Those data could be correlated against other information—data collected from Facebook, fashioned by the app, or acquired elsewhere. Because I collected and stored my users’ true Facebook IDs to be able to count their clicks and build their pastures and the like, I still have them, and, in theory, I could use them nefariously. A 2014 terms-of-service update prohibits some of that activity, but not everyone cares about violating the Facebook terms of service.","The second type of information is a piece of profile data Cow Clicker received without asking for it. Back in 2010, Facebook still allowed users to join “networks”—affiliations like schools, workplaces, and organizations. In some cases, those affiliations required authorization, for example having an email address at a domain that corresponds with a university. Over time, verification became less important to Facebook, and now users can affiliate with schools or workplaces arbitrarily. The less friction, the more data.","In 2010, on my friend’s couch in Brooklyn, I noticed that Facebook was shipping user affiliation data over the wire to me, so I decided to store it. Facebook allowed apps to store data for which user permission was granted, but urged developers not to request or store more than it needed to operate. Putting affiliation data in the Cow Clicker database allowed me to provide leaderboard rankings by network, allowing my players to compete for clicks with their work colleagues or classmates.","That’s neither a terribly interesting feature nor a particularly wicked one. But because I stored the numerical identifiers for user affiliations, I still have them. Until 2016, I could use a database-query tool called FQL, Facebook Query Language, to retrieve the details of those networks, and correlate them back to my users. Had I wanted to, I could have recombined that information with other data and used it for retargeting.","Cow Clicker’s example is so modest, it might not even seem like a problem. What does it matter if a simple diversion has your Facebook ID, education, and work affiliations? Especially since its solo creator (that’s me) was too dumb or too lazy to exploit that data toward pernicious ends. But even if I hadn’t thought about it at the time, I could have done so years later, long after the cows vanished, and once Cow Clicker players forgot that they’d ever installed my app.","This is also why Zuckerberg’s response to the present controversy feels so toothless. Facebook has vowed to audit companies that have collected, shared, or sold large volumes of data in violation of its policy, but the company cannot close the Pandora’s box it opened a decade ago, when it first allowed external apps to collect Facebook user data. That information is now in the hands of thousands, maybe millions of people.","To be honest, I’m not even sure I know what the Facebook platform’s terms of service dictated that I do with user data acquired from Facebook. Technically, users could revoke certain app permissions later, and apps were supposed to remove any impacted data that they had stored. I doubt most apps did that, and I suspect users never knew—and still don’t know—that revoking access to an app they used eight years ago doesn’t do anything to reverse transmissions that took place years ago.","As Jason Koebler put it at Motherboard, it’s too late. “If your data has already been taken, Facebook has no mechanism and no power to make people delete it. If your data was taken, it has very likely been sold, laundered, and put back into Facebook.” Indeed, all the publicity around Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica crisis might be sending lots of old app developers, like me, back to old code and dusty databases, wondering what they’ve even got stored and what it might yet be worth.","Facebook’s laissez-faire openness surely contributed to the data-extraction free-for-all that’s playing itself out now via the example of Cambridge Analytica. But so did its move-fast-and-break-things attitude toward software development. The Facebook platform was truly a nightmare to use and to maintain. It was built like no other software system then extant, and it changed constantly—regular updates rolled out weekly. Old code broke, seemingly for no good reason. Some Facebook app developers were dishonest from the start, and others couldn’t help themselves once they saw the enormous volume of data they could slurp from millions or tens of millions of Facebook users. But many more were just struggling to eke out a part of their living in an ecosystem where people might discover them.","Millions of apps had been created by 2012, when I hung up my cowboy hat. Not only apps apparently designed with duplicity in mind, like Aleksandr Kogan’s personality-quiz, which extracted data that was then sold to Cambridge Analytica. But hundreds of thousands of creators of dumb toys, quizzes, games, and communities that might never have intended to dupe or violate users surely did so anyway, because Facebook rammed their data down our throats. On the whole, none of us asked for your data. But we have it anyway, and forever.","We want to hear what you think about this article.

He said the firm \"works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc that make them think things are happening that may not be\".","This idea of \"information dominance\", of propaganda, Wylie told The Guardian newspaper earlier, is the notion that if you can control all of the streams of information to your opponents: \"You can influence how they perceive that battle space and you can then influence how they're going to behave and react.\"","Late on Friday, Facebook said it would ban Cambridge Analytica, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270 000 people who downloaded a purported research app described as a personality test. Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn't disclosed it until now.","The developments are the latest to show how people try to exploit Facebook in ways that could sway elections, and in the worst cases even undermine democracy. Before the Cambridge imbroglio, there were Russian agents running election-related propaganda campaigns through targeted ads and fake political events.","Wylie claimed Cambridge Analytica used the data it had while speaking with Russian businesses.

The social media giant added just 22 million new daily active users worldwide, its lowest increase since at least early 2011. Facebook has been hampered by scandal after scandal for the past 18 months, but until now, it hasn’t seen an impact on user growth or revenue.","Founded in 1990, ScanMyPhotos, based in Irvine, Calif. has digitized more than 600 million pictures. As longtime advocates on important consumer and social issues, the company is urging every Facebook user to delete their account and not upload any pictures. However, we are supportive of Facebook regarding how it tags photographs.","ScanMyPhotos is an unaffiliated content provider for all photo-sharing app innovators, including the behemoth Facebook platform. Yet, the photographic data that was digitized, then uploaded may become a doormat for data breaches. Will it be used by advertisers who wield the market power to control content, often without any awareness by Facebook’s unsuspecting users? Another looming issue is the tagging of photos without users’ consent.","Cambridge Analytica LLC, the British-based data mining company accused of exploiting and improperly obtaining personal information from upwards of 87 million Facebook users underscores an alarming practice. With $40 billion in 2017 advertising revenues, Facebook is everywhere and boasts 2 billion monthly users. One-quarter of all people use the platform which leads to lots of eyeballs, yet may be unsecured from fraud and misappropriating content shared by its users.","“Protecting the privacy of customers is the core of everything we do at ScanMyPhotos, yet Facebook let us and every user down. As loyalist advocates, we had recommended people upload their newly digitized pictures to post and share on Facebook,” said Mitch Goldstone, President & CEO of the e-commerce photo digitization service.","As Facebook’s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg prepares to appear at a House Committee hearing on April 11 to discuss data privacy, we have a question. Does Facebook keep the metadata information from all the uploaded pictures? if so, is this another privacy issue and opportunity for more data breaches? Do they market and sell this information?","Ever since its epic data breach, we have been troubled. They indirectly built our business — most of the 500 million pictures digitized by ScanMyPhotos were uploaded by customers to the Facebook platform. As one of Facebook’s first loyalist advocates — they spotlighted the need to digitize old photos to upload — now it’s principles over profits. While Facebook does filter out EXIF and geotagging data when users upload pictures as part of its data retention, is all that private metadata coding information still retained by them? If so, what does Facebook do with it?","Things you do and information you provide. We collect the content and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share, and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content you provide, such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. We also collect information about how you use our Services, such as the types of content you view or engage with or the frequency and duration of your activities.","The problem with Facebook goes beyond making sure this does not happen again. It must be regulated, just as all other advertising is, and they must also lead with an “honest ads act” transparency law.","Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg in Cambridge, MA, the CEO said: “privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people. One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data.”","In response, Goldstone explained that “the social-media advertising company’s market power and priorities are misguided, as privacy must be their single biggest imperative. This is why they are now embroiled in this historic controversy. Facebook’s unsuspecting users are just the product, as the advertisers have become the customers.”","Few ever read or understand the legal terms of service contract prior to hypnotically clicking to approve. What happens to the uploaded pictures? Will a forensic audit of the firm reveal whether not just users’ background information, but their content and pictures may have been exploited and breached?","While Mr. Zuckerberg agrees to rectify the lost trust, he hasn’t “seen a meaningful number of people act on that [Delete Facebook campaign].” ScanMyPhotos hopes to get on their radar along with millions of others to create a movement to help restore trust. However, the advertising-supported business model, where users are the product is broken. According to Brian X. Chen, lead consumer technology writer for The New York Times, deleting Facebook is just the beginning as they own many other apps which are under its umbrella, including WhatsApp and Instagram. Closing your account may take days to process. For many, especially businesses, it is not so easy to delete Facebook as it has become a primary means to conduct commerce.","In a 2009 interview with the BBC’s Laura Trevelyan, when asked “so just to be clear, you’re not going to sell, or share, any of the information,” Zuckerberg replied: “the person who’s putting the content on Facebook always owns it… This is their information and they own it. What the terms say is just, we’re not going to share people’s information.”","The Zuckerberg “I’m sorry” apology tour just does not cut it. This problem occurred three years ago.","Until their public responsibility is resolved and trust restored, ScanMyPhotos presses upon users to #DeleteFacebook.","BONUS: It is nearly magic as we digitize upwards of 300,000 each day.

One of those proposals is the Democratically backed Medicare-for-All bill, introduced last September. The Kaiser Health Tracking Poll has found that after a year of our Republican-led country, more and more people want exactly the opposite of what the Republican party is offering.","This month’s Kaiser Health Tracking Poll finds six in ten (59 percent) favor a national health plan, or Medicare-for-all, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan – including a majority of both Democrats and independents and about one-third of Republicans. Support for such a proposal increases among the overall public (75 percent) and among partisans (87 percent of Democrats, 74 percent of independents, and 64 percent of Republicans) when framed as an option for anyone who wants it, but people who currently have other forms of coverage can keep the coverage they already have. It is unclear how support would fare if these proposals became part of the larger public debate as previous KFF polling has found the public’s attitudes can be quite malleable.","The Kaiser poll also found that prescription prices was a top concern for people. It also found that sadly, Republicans are willing to be peed on and call it rain.","The majority of Republicans are confident President Trump and his administration will be able to deliver on most of the promises asked about, with one notable exception – ending the prescription painkiller addiction epidemic. Vast majorities of Republicans are confident in President Trump and his administration’s ability to deliver on infrastructure (87 percent) and on immigration reform (80 percent), while about seven in ten are confident in their ability to repeal the ACA (74 percent), lower the cost of prescription drugs (73 percent), and build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico (70 percent). Notably, equal shares of Republicans (49 percent) say they are both confident and not confident that President Trump and his administration will be able to deliver on his promise to end the prescription painkiller addiction epidemic.","However, they do agree that Congress and Trump are not doing enough to bring down the costs of prescription drugs—of course, they believe that the Democrats are equally guilty of not doing enough, even though Republicans control both the House and the Senate. Now more than ever, get out that vote!"],"isopubdate":""}

We're trying to overcome the opaque nature of political Facebook advertising (often dubbed \"dark advertising\") which is often only seen by the people who are targeted.","We have been able to identify a few clear trends from the hundreds of ads that we've been sent so far.","Here's the strongest: the Conservatives are paying for numerous adverts that attack Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn or his close allies, particularly John McDonnell and Diane Abbott. They broadcast a broadly negative message - warning people about the perceived threats of a Corbyn-led government.","Image copyrightConservatives/FacebookImage caption\nA Conservative attack advert that was targeted at a voter in Bishop Auckland.","The Conservative adverts we've seen focus on three key policy themes: Brexit, taxation and national security. However, on all these themes, a common message is employed to critique Corbyn: that it would be too \"risky\" to entrust the Labour leadership with government.","According to Tim Bale of Queen Mary University, an expert in Conservative Party politics, the Tories are keen to play on Theresa May's favourable leadership ratings.","\"The Tories know from work done by [top campaign strategists] Lynton Crosby and Mark Textor that Corbyn is Labour's biggest weakness and May is their biggest strength,\" Bale told BBC Trending. \"Targeting Corbyn's leadership is a no-brainer.\"","The Conservative attack ads are often reactive - responding quickly to current events. The below advert was sent to us, just hours after Corbyn stumbled over childcare figures in an interview with BBC Woman's Hour.","Image copyrightConservatives/Facebook","Negative political adverts are particularly widespread in the United States, where parties routinely attack the credibility of a candidate and try to alienate their natural supporters. Donald Trump's election campaign, for example, directed anti-Clinton Facebook adverts at potential Clinton supporters, including African-Americans and young women.","There may be some signs of a similar strategy now being used in the UK. Our crowdsourced anti-Corbyn adverts were almost exclusively sent to us by individuals whose Facebook \"likes\" would identify them on the left of the political spectrum.","The Tory adverts are different in tone from US \"attack ads,\" however. Though negatively spotlighting Corbyn, they also contain positive messages about the Conservatives, in an attempt to persuade voters to lend their vote to Theresa May's party on 8 June.","Eurosceptic Labour seats in Conservative crosshairs","Our crowdsourced experiment has also revealed more about the local ambitions of the Conservatives.","We found that the Conservatives are targeting Labour or Liberal Democrat seats in the Midlands and the North, where a significant proportion of the electorate voted for UKIP in 2015. We have seen adverts from 12 constituencies that match this profile. The aim seems to be to not only attract UKIP voters, but also Labour supporters with reservations about Corbyn.","\"The geographical targeting on Facebook is pretty granular,\" says Carl Miller of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at Demos. \"This allows political parties to focus their adverts on target seats.\"","For example, one individual in our survey is a resident of Newcastle-under-Lyme - a Labour-held marginal constituency that is under challenge from the Tories. A considerable number of people in the constituency voted UKIP in 2015 - 16.9% of voters.","With UKIP lagging well behind that level nationwide in the latest polls, however, the Tories have been aiming to pick up ex-UKIP voters. But a uniform swing from UKIP to the Tories is by no means guaranteed. Thus, turning Eurosceptic Labour constituencies into Tory seats might rely on persuading some Labour voters to turn their backs on Corbyn.","This is certainly the case in West Bromwich West - another place where anti-Corbyn adverts have been seen by voters who sent ads to us. The constituency is a safe seat held by Labour MP Adrian Bailey and, at the last election, the Tories finished third in the constituency with 8,213 fewer votes than Labour. UKIP came second, with 8,836 votes in total. The Conservatives might expect to absorb a large chunk of the UKIP vote in June, but the party will also likely need to swing a significant chunk of Labour voters in order to achieve what would be an upset.","Image copyrightConservatives/FacebookImage caption\nOne of the Conservatives' attack adverts - directed at a voter in West Bromwich West.","Avoiding a Brexit backlash","Anti-Corbyn posts are also being deployed in Conservative-held areas, which are potentially at risk of being lost to the Liberal Democrats over the issue of Brexit. We have seen adverts in four such constituencies.","Multiple individuals living in the Oxford West and Abingdon constituency contacted Trending to say that they had been targeted by the ads. This constituency is a Conservative seat, but 70% of Oxfordshire voted Remain in the EU referendum. In 2015, the Liberal Democrats - a proudly pro-EU party - finished second in the constituency, and the Conservatives seem keen to fend off an anti-Brexit backlash by encouraging Labour voters to back the incumbent candidate.","It seems that the Conservatives are not just focusing on Facebook, however. Dozens of people have emailed us with examples of Conservative adverts on YouTube. They are even widening their net to Google - paying for people to see a Tory advert when you search \"Liberal Democrats\":","Image copyrightGoogle","Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also been pushing adverts on social media, though with a different tone. Labour ads on Facebook focus on positive messages, often using the party's election slogan: \"For the many, not the few\".","Image copyrightLabour/Facebook","Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat adverts focus on the issue of Brexit - with of course a much different line than the Conservatives. Many of the ads attack May and Corbyn on their approaches to Brexit, though they often also carry an uplifting final message.","Image copyrightLiberal Democrats/Facebook","A word of caution is in order though: our methodology is limited by the fact that we can only see what you, our audience, send us.","In addition, though Facebook ads can be targeted towards towns and cities, and in some cases areas within major centres, they can't always hit individual constituencies. Indeed, several voters saw ads for candidates in neighbouring constituencies, or ads from parties that had very little hope of winning their local seat.","These adverts are of course an incomplete glimpse into the scale of social media advertising in Britain. Carl Miller of Demos says that he will be \"astonished\" if UK political parties spend less than a total of £3.5 million on targeted Facebook adverts during the general election campaign. However, even such a small snapshot provides an illuminating glimpse into the electoral strategies of political groups and digital campaigning as a whole.","For more on how the parties are using social media during this election, watch Newsnight tonight on BBC2 at 22:30.","We're still keen to get a better understanding of social media advertising during the general election.","If you spot an advert in your social media feed which looks political then please send us a screengrab or a link to the content.

Video: Parliament TV","Free from the shackles of regulation, Mark Zuckerberg has assembled a community larger than any religion or country. Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images","The role of historical context in providing a modern understanding should never be downplayed. Introducing to center stage, Facebook, which has been thrust into the limelight by Cambridge Analytica hiding in one wing, and an unnamed swarm of Russian influence-bots in the other. The actors may seem new, and the arena different, but if history can tell us anything it is that this is a play that we have already seen several times over.","Western economies have grown over the centuries through repeated cycles of unbound and often catastrophic growth, followed by periods of anguish, grievance and eventually regulation.","Similar theatrical genres that have captured our hearts, minds and economies have included Wild West renditions of industrialists gaining economic strongholds through railroads, oil and steel corporations – not too dissimilar to the current genre of China’s investment on the African continent – and the more recent motion picture of The Bank Heist: the inside job that stole the global economy, depicting the financial institutions’ rampant and unfettered speculation on, well, anything, which forced us to turn to the government for a fix. “Too big to fail” is what we heard back then. The theme tune of today’s social media crisis can be sung to the lyrics “too big to regulate”.","Facebook, however, has not found itself in this arena alone. It is a founding member of the Frightful Five – Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon. Frightful not just because of their financial dominance – they are the largest US companies by stock-market value – but also because of their undue influence over (dis)information and global politics.","Their complicated relationships to Ireland notwithstanding, these American-founded corporations pose an implicit threat to the jurisdictions of world governments.","They sit in a lonely group of five through the creation of a massive and defensible moat called the network effect which surrounded their technology platform in the early 2000s. This has since allowed them to fully control an entirely new market around communication, media and civil society.","Money trail","Arguments have been made that it is the enlightened investors who should have predicted that so few companies would hold such power. Others have gone further to say that this crisis is the horse that the investors didn’t only back, but bred, jockeyed and fed more than just hay. In a capitalist America, technology venture investors are heroes responsible for blowing oxygen into the flame of the American Dream. Across the Atlantic in a social-led Ireland, many are fast to demonise the money trail that leads to problems like Facebook’s social and information inequality.","It isn’t just Facebook and the other four whose power is growing exponentially; it is the perilously high levels of power of the executives themselves. Mark Zuckerberg has created Facebook in a way such that as his company grows, so too does his reach within the company through a dual-class shareholder system.","In a regular “one share, one vote” system, Facebook’s large growth and entrance to the public markets would have seen him owning an increasingly small slice of the Facebook pie and having heightened governance by outside influences. The opposite is true here, as Zuckerberg clings on to controlling nearly 60 per cent of the stock. This is important; ownership of a company does not just pertain to a legal right to the profits achieved by that company, but also conveys the right to participate in how that company is governed.","Mark Zuckerberg has created Facebook in a way such that as his company grows, so too does his reach within the company through a dual-class shareholder system","Free from the shackles of regulation, Zuckerberg has assembled a community that is larger than any religion or country, controlling the most valuable global data. But who controls him? In a free-market economy run by our western ideology, we believe we will enjoy the upside of increased profits and high growth while being able to self-regulate and steer ourselves away from the downside. The unregulated dual-shares system that Facebook has employed is increasingly raising alarms, even to the early investors, who see the clear risks of power corruption.","The crucial issue is not Cambridge Analytica or Russian bots but is instead Facebook and Big Tech accountability; first, who can protect the users and consumers of the Facebook product, and second, who can protect the shareholders? Neither Zuckerberg nor his number two in command, Sheryl Sandberg, has addressed one of the largest technology crises to erupt of recent times.","Beast to be tamed","While enjoying the friendliness, utility and all-encompassing convenience of social media, we have created a situation whereby the most powerful person in the world cannot be removed from office. We have, like by like and share by share, created a global information autocrat. Facebook is too big to regulate and its leader is nowhere to be found. We have, perhaps unwittingly and through lack of considerate regulation, created a beast that cannot be tamed.","So who will regulate? Prior to the “tech bubble”, a European company of this size and holding an operating strength in so many industries would have been long broken up in the interest of market and shareholder protection. The mislabelling of Facebook as a social media instead of a purely media platform provides robust protection, which won’t change anytime soon in the United States.","There is intellectual dispersion surrounding the regulatory methodology of the five, with the academic left seeking anti-trust reform and the political right being elusive as the tech industry uses its consequential fortunes to lobby. It is sure that the new information war will break out, as many other wars have done before, on the European continent.","As the US looks to Europe, which houses deep technical and regulatory expertise in this industry, one ponders about the director who is brave enough to write the script for the final act. If nothing else, we can be sure that the curtain won’t close on this show without industry heads rolling and the onset of a long period of shameful reflection, as prescribed to us in every historical play that has come before.","Sinéad O’Sullivan is a Sainsbury management fellow at Harvard Business School.

It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and it is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica and two individuals going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that University of Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data that he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said that Kogan gained access to profile and other information “in a legitimate way” but “he did not subsequently abide by our rules” when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies. (bit.ly/2FZU1Ir)","Eunoia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan’s app when it learned of the violation in 2015, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.","Although all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said that it received reports in the past several days that “not all data was deleted”, prompting the suspension announced on Friday."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Amy Kloubuchar (D-MN) is calling on Zuckerberg to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves,” she tweeted on Saturday. “Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.”","Advertisement","Her demands were echoed by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) on Monday in an open letter to Zuckerberg. “The troubling reporting on the ease with which Cambridge Analytica was able to exploit Facebook’s default privacy settings…raises serious concerns about the role Facebook played in facilitating and permitting the covert collection and misuse of consumer information,” he wrote. “Cambridge Analytica was able to use Facebook-developed marketed tools to weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.”","With little oversight & no meaningful intervention from @Facebook, Cambridge Analytica was able to use Facebook- developed & marketed tools to weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.","Wyden then demanded that Zuckerberg answer a series of questions about the breach, including whether Facebook had identified the users impacted and notified then, how many apps it had audited over the last ten years, and why Facebook did not suspend Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when it learned the company has obtained and used the data.","Kloubuchar’s and Wyden’s calls were backed up by a similar open letter to Zuckerberg from Sens. John Thune (R-SD), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Jerry Moran (R-KS). The three senators — who sit on the Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over data privacy issues — want to establish whether or not Facebook had been transparent with consumers. Sen. Kloubuchar also then joined with Louisiana Republican Sen. John N. Kennedy to ask Zuckerberg to explain how Cambridge Analytica managed to harvest data from Facebook. Sen.
