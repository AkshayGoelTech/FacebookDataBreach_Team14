The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.","“We have a long history of working behind the scenes,” Mr. Nix said.","The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump’s 2016 campaign.","The results of Channel 4’s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday, days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.","The weekend’s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.","Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analytica.","The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.","Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, have done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.","Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell — it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.","SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.","But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.","“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” he told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. “We can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There’s so many options we can look at.”","The Channel 4 reporter posed as a “fixer” for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.","The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put “into the bloodstream to the internet,” said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.","“Then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,” he added. “It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda.’ Because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”","The most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix’s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.","At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.","“I mean, deep digging is interesting,” he said. “But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true, and make sure that that’s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”","Mr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,” he said. “We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.”","Or, Mr. Nix said, they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house — we have lots of history of things.”","The reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. “I’m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,” Mr. Nix replied. “You know what I’m saying.”","“They are very beautiful,” he said. “I find that works very well.”","To be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he said.","Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”","The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbull “humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,” it said.","“They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,” the company said.","For Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain’s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.","But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.","Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.","“We need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,” she said.","In a statement, Facebook said that it had “hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”","But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before the information commissioner did.","“What are they doing?” Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. “Are they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.”","Mr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company’s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee. He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg, or another senior executive from Facebook, to do the same."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

And there aren’t many left that have potential to become seriously large in the future. Several analysts believe Walmart may have overpaid but that will depend on how well it can integrate Flipkart’s operations with its global plans and what synergies can be brought about. “Amazon has put in $5 billion in India to build the business from the ground up and Walmart just paid more than triple that amount for Flipkart,” said the CEO of a large retailer.","But the headache may have just begun. After all, integration has often been a major irritant for Walmart with plans having gone awry in Germany, South Korea and, now in Brazil. Even in its home market, the US, Walmart has struggled with its online operations despite its $3 billion acquisition of internet retailer Jet.com. The company, which has been on a startup buying spree to boost its omni-channel ambitions, garners only around 3% of its total sales from online, according to Edleweiss Securities.","Sources said, Walmart’s strategy in India is clear: Quickly move into an area that Walmart understands best and where Flipkart is largely absent — grocery. While groceries contribute around 50% to Walmart’s global sales, the market for online groceries is expected to drive e-commerce growth over the next five years. After missing the bus in China, Walmart doesn’t want to miss out on the India opportunity, where e-commerce is projected to grow 4x (36%) faster than total retail over next five years driven by cheap data and smartphones.","At the same time, the plan is to lower the share of mobile phones and electronics on Flipkart, categories that rank on top in terms of GMV, while focusing on building a network of cold chains and further strengthening the supply chain. Walmart may also try to also create synergies beween Flipkart and its cash-and-carry business run by Krish Iyer and his team.","Some Flipkart sellers may join Walmart supply chain","While Iyer will help continue to expand the wholesale footprint, Walmart will use Flipkart to take on Seattle-headquartered Amazon, which recently stepped into Walmart’s turf by making its omnichannel intent clear through its $13.7-billion acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods.","Meanwhile in India, as Flipkart is strengthened and processes tweaked to ensure compliance with American laws, the back-end operations of both companies, including the technology platforms are proposed to be aligned. At the same time, some sellers on Flipkart may also become part of Walmart’s global supply chain and buyers from its Indian wholesale cash-and-carry stores may become sellers on the just-acquired marketplace."],"isopubdate":"2018-05-10"}

And that paralysis is, remarkably quickly, leading people to reassess their relationship with the site as a whole. The teens got there first, really. Facebook usage among younger people has been declining for years, in the face of competition from upstart rivals such as Snapchat, internal disruption from Facebook-owned Instagram, and a general sense that Facebook is full of old people and parents.

Why did we give up our privacy so willingly? And how can we get it back?","The Guardian view on big tech: a new era needs new rules | Editorial","Read more","The 50m profiles harvested from Facebook by a Cambridge Analytica partner under the guise of research are a huge data store, but they pale in comparison with the amount of information the company holds on its own users. At the same time that Facebook turned off the spigot that had been used to pump industrial quantities of data off its platform, the company opened up a second set of floodgates: the Facebook Audience Network, which allows third parties to track, profile and advertise to Facebook users wherever they find them on the internet.","Facebook isn’t really a social network. It’s barely even an advertising company. It’s a data analytics firm, which manages to use its position as the middleman for a vast proportion of all human communication to find out everything there is to know about its users.","Just as Cambridge Analytica claimed enormous powers of perception with a scant selection of personal information, Facebook also boasts to advertisers about how much it knows about its users – and how effective it can be at influencing their minds: it cites a games company that “made video adverts to match different gamer styles” for a “63% increase in purchase intent”; a clothes retailer that achieved “a dramatic increase in sales” with “richly personalised ads”; and a mobile network that scored “a major boost in awareness and purchase intent” by focusing on users with families. (Facebook used to have a similar page on which it showed off to politicians about how effective it was at swinging elections, but it quietly removed that in February.)","If you think you’re a passive user of Facebook, minimising the data you provide to the site or refraining from oversharing details of your life, you have probably underestimated the scope of its reach. Facebook doesn’t just learn from the pictures you post, and the comments you leave: the site learns from which posts you read and which you don’t; it learns from when you stop scrolling down your feed and how long it takes you to restart; it learns from your browsing on other websites that have nothing to do with Facebook itself; and it even learns from the messages you type out then delete before sending (the company published an academic paper on this “self-censorship” back in 2013).","Facebook boasts to advertisers about how much it knows about its users – and how it can influence their minds","This data life isn’t limited to Facebook. Google, famously, is in the same basic business, although the company is a bit more transparent about it (for a shock, try going to the “My Activity” and “Location History” pages to be vividly reminded that Google is tracking everything). And Amazon is building a modern surveillance panopticon, replete with an always-on microphone for your kitchen and a jaunty camera for your bedroom, purely to sell you more stuff.","Avoiding the big players doesn’t help much. Large data brokers such as Experian and Equifax exist to collate information about everyone, whether or not they’re online. The security services continue to build their own surveillance databases, with powers strengthened in the UK through the recent Investigatory Powers Act. Even going to church now comes with the potential for a dose of surveillance: the Church of England has authorised the roll-out of 14,000 contactless card readers, to let parishioners give without carrying cash. Is it time to say goodbye to the anonymity of the collection plate, and hope you’re one of the more generous donors?","Richard Stallman has been warning of this state of affairs since before Zuckerberg even touched his first computer. The veteran computer scientist, creator of the GNU operating system and leader of the Free Software Movement, warns that “the only database that is not dangerous is the one that is never collected”.","“There is a limit on the level of surveillance that democracy can co-exist with, and we’re far above that,” he tells me on the phone from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “We suffer more surveillance than the inhabitants of the Soviet Union, and we need to push it way down.","“Any database of personal data will be misused, if a misuse can be imagined by humans. It can be misused by the organisation that collects the data. In many cases, the purpose of collecting it is to misuse it, as in the case of Facebook, but also in the case of Amazon, Google to some extent, and thousands of smaller companies as well.","“It can also be misused by rogue employees of the company and it can also be stolen by some third party and misused. There’d be no danger of data breaches if a database doesn’t exist. And, finally, it can be taken by the state and misused.”","Stallman has little sympathy for those who choose to use such services. “They’re foolish,” he says, when I ask him why he thinks data harvesting is tacitly accepted by so many people. “They’re accustomed to a certain kind of convenience ... they choose to ignore that it might be dangerous.”","I’m less certain that there’s a choice being made at all, though. Yes, people may regularly be accepting terms and conditions that require them to give up their data, but that doesn’t mean they read them. I should know: I have. A few years ago, I decided to read, in full, the small print for every single product or service I used. I read almost 150,000 words of legalese – three-quarters of Moby Dick – in less than a week, from the 21,000 words required to turn off the alarm on my iPhone on a Monday morning to the 4,000 words required to browse BuzzFeed in my lunch break.","The experience was gruesome. Legal documents are not written to be read by humans, and certainly not to be read back-to-back in a harrowing marathon of End-User Licence Agreements. But I did learn one thing, which is that the modern notion of consent upon which the entire data edifice is built has the shakiest of foundations.","Lukasz Olejnik, an independent security and privacy researcher, agrees: “Years ago, people and organisations used to shift the blame on the users, even in public. This blaming is unfortunate, because expecting users to be subject-matter experts and versed in the obscure technical aspects is misguided.","“Blaming users is an oversimplification, as most do not understand the true implications when data are shared – they cannot. You can’t expect people to fully appreciate the amount of information extracted from aggregated datasets. That said, you can’t expect users to know what is really happening with their data if it’s not clearly communicated in an informed consent prompt, which should in some cases include also the consequences of hitting ‘I agree’.”","He adds that at many organisations, privacy was not being taken seriously, “except when there was a need to include the phrase ‘We take the privacy of our users very seriously’ following a data breach”.","The modern notion of consent upon which the entire data edifice is built has the shakiest of foundations","It doesn’t have to be like this. Doctors are required to demonstrate not just consent, but informed consent, from patients: the latter have to understand what they are agreeing to, or the agreement is moot. After years of mis-selling scandals, the same principle is slowly making its way to the financial industry. Logging in to check an ISA, you may be confronted with a 12-point questionnaire designed to check you understand the risks and are happy for the investment to continue.","Yet online, the biggest companies in the world base their businesses around users hitting “I agree” on a dialogue box on a website once, a decade ago, and then never being told what their agreement entails, nor being offered any way to retract their consent and take back control of the information they gave up.","Change is coming. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR – overhauls a continent’s worth of rules around a clear principle that the only person who can ever own an individual’s data is that individual. Olejnik describes the law as a “good starter”, but notes that even it will still need to be “reviewed and updated on a regular basis”.","Stallman wants to go one step further. “I recommend a law prohibiting any system that collects data,” he says, “no matter who runs it, whether it’s a company, some non-profit organisation, or a public agency, whatever, that they are not allowed to collect data unless they can justify it as absolutely necessary for the function to be done.”","It would be a huge step, and one that is unlikely to come without a radical change in how the public views mass data collection. But he has hope, and rejects the label of a Cassandra, doomed with accurate predictions that will always be ignored.","“I don’t know the future, because the future depends on you, so I’m going to try my damn best,” he says. “I’m a pessimist by nature. But just because things look dim, is no reason to give up. And that’s what I’ve been saying for many, many years.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.”","Facebook shares fell as much as 6.5 percent, briefly dipping below $150 for the first time since July 2017, before recovering the day’s losses to close up 0.4 percent at $160.06.","The shares are still down 13 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica. The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.","Related Coverage","The recovery in Facebook’s stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company’s relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.","The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.","If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.","ALL APOLOGIES","Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company’s privacy practices.","The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.","The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.","“Facebook’s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,” said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.","Slideshow (3 Images)","In Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is “absolutely certain” that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.","Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers’ access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.","“The was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time,” Zuckerberg said in the ads. “We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”","‘FUTURE REGULATION’","His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany’s justice minister said Facebook’s promises were not enough.","“In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,” Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.","Advertisers and users are also unhappy.","U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet’s YouTube for one week.","Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.","Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.","Reporting by David Shepardson; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Susan Thomas"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Over the weekend, the media reported a whistleblower’s account of serious misuse of user data. The social network is now under more pressure than ever …","“I need to make amends,” said the man with the pink hair.","Christopher Wylie, a 27-year-old vegan from Canada, may not seem like the type to mess with Western democracy. But the data expert was key in creating a system that harvested Facebook users’ data and used it in political campaigns. His regret about this led him to tell his story to The New York Times and The Observer, whose reports have caused a huge stir.","In 2013, he had an idea. New research was showing that a person’s social media activity can be used to build a detailed profile of their personality. Wylie believed that it can predict their political views too. Armed with such data, a political candidate could, say, target ads at potential voters.","Wylie soon found financial backers:\nRepublicans\nin the U.S. He helped set up a company in the U.K.,\nCambridge Analytica\n(CA), to execute his vision. The company hired\nAleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge academic, to create a Facebook app that asked users to give access to their profile. It also invited them to share data about their friends (without the friends’ consent).","Altogether, the app gathered data on around\n50 million\nAmericans. It claimed to need the data for academic purposes. In fact, Kogan sold the information to CA, which went on to help Donald Trump’s campaign. The sale violated Facebook’s privacy rules. The social media giant learned of this in 2015; according to Wylie, it\ndid not try\nvery hard to set things right.","As Wylie puts it, “We ‘broke’ Facebook.”","CA’s and Facebook’s influence on politics is being investigated in both the U.S and the U.K. Wylie’s revelations, backed by hard evidence, contradict\nstatements\nmade by the companies to the inquiries. Both deny any wrongdoing. However, Facebook has suspended CA (and Wylie) from its platform, and says it is looking into the issue.","This apparent breach of data comes at an\nawkward time\nfor Facebook. The company was already on the defensive, as critics accused it of spreading fake news and Russian propaganda. Should we just stop using Facebook?","Sell-by data","No:\nNo way, say some. Overall, Facebook is a force for good. Whether you want to raise awareness of an issue that’s close to your heart or just message a friend, the website is on your side. Let’s take this crisis as an opportunity to read its privacy rules, and make sure we’re using it responsibly.","Yes:\nHow naive, reply others. Facebook’s privacy policy is designed to confuse you. But Wylie’s story shows that, even if it has the best intentions, the website is sloppy about protecting your data. A scary amount of your personal information is ending up in unauthorized people’s hands. The only way to avoid this for sure is to log off for good.","You decide","Would the world be a poorer place without Facebook?","Will social media still exist in 50 years?","Activities","Make a list of the information that is publicly displayed on your social media. Pair up, and write a “personality profile” of your partner based on their info.","Spend a week without going on social media. Keep a journal of your thoughts about the experience. Will you go back to social media in a week? Why (not)?","Some people say …","“Move fast and break things.”","— Facebook’s former motto","What do you think?","Q & A","What do we know?","Kogan’s app paid Facebook users to take a personality test. In return, it got access to “almost everything” on their profiles, says Wylie. This was permitted — but selling the data was not (which is why Facebook is blaming Kogan for everything). On learning of Kogan’s deal with CA in 2015, Facebook shut down his app, and asked everyone involved to delete the data. But it has just confessed that this did not happen.","What do we not know?","Exactly how this data was used, and what effect it had. Former officials on the Trump campaign say that CA helped them design target audiences for digital ads, model voter turnout, and more. However, some say that CA has exaggerated its own influence; others argue that it may not have relied much on the “stolen” data anyway.","Word watch","Republicans","CA received its funding from Robert Mercer, an American billionaire who initially backed Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign, before switching to Trump. The company was co-founded by Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser.","Cambridge Analytica","The company also worked with the pro-Brexit campaign in the U.K. It is independent of Cambridge University.","Aleksandr Kogan","The Russia-born neuroscientist has received research grants from the Russian government.","50 million","This was equal to almost one-quarter of registered American voters at the time.","Did not try","Wylie says Facebook was slow to ask him to delete the data, and when it eventually did, it failed to double-check that he had complied.","Statements","The Parliamentary committee that interrogated Facebook and CA executives now wants them to come back and explain themselves.

The letter was issued after Al-Jazeera said it planned to air a documentary by a reporter who went undercover to look into the Israel lobby in the United States. The action by the senator and the House members follows the decision by the Justice Department to force RT America to register as a foreign agent and the imposition of algorithms by Facebook, Google and Twitter that steer traffic away from left-wing, anti-war and progressive websites, including Truthdig.

The handful of independent websites and news outlets, including this one, and a few foreign-run networks such as Al-Jazeera and RT America, on which I host a show, “On Contact,” are the few platforms left that examine corporate power and empire, the curtailment of our civil liberties, lethal police violence and the ecocide carried out by the fossil fuel and animal agriculture industries, as well as cover the war crimes committed by Israel and the U.S. military in the Middle East. Shutting down these venues would ensure that the critics who speak through them, and oppressed peoples such as the Palestinians, have no voice left.","I witnessed and was at times the victim of black propaganda campaigns when I was a foreign correspondent. False accusations are made anonymously and then amplified by a compliant press. The anonymous site PropOrNot, replicating this tactic, in 2016 published a blacklist of 199 sites that it alleged, with no evidence, “reliably echo Russian propaganda.” More than half of those sites were far-right, conspiracy-driven ones. But about 20 of the sites were progressive, anti-war and left-wing. They included AlterNet, Black Agenda Report, Democracy Now!, Naked Capitalism, Truthdig, Truthout, CounterPunch and the World Socialist Web Site. PropOrNot charged that these sites disseminated “fake news” on behalf of Russia, and the allegations became front-page news in The Washington Post in a story headlined “Russian propaganda effort helped spread ‘fake news’ during the election, experts say.” Washington Post reporter Craig Timberg wrote in that article that the goal of “a sophisticated Russian propaganda effort,” according to “independent researchers who have tracked the operation,” was “punishing Democrat Hillary Clinton, helping Republican Donald Trump and undermining faith in American democracy.”","To date, no one has exposed who operates PropOrNot or who is behind the website. But the damage done by this black propaganda campaign and the subsequent announcement by Google and other organizations such as Facebook last April that they had put in filters to elevate “more authoritative content” and marginalize “blatantly misleading, low quality, offensive or downright false information” have steadily diverted readers away from some sites. The Marxist World Socialist Web Site, for example, has seen its traffic decline by 75 percent. AlterNet’s search traffic is down 71 percent, Consortium News is down 72 percent, and Global Research and Truthdig have seen declines. And the situation appears to be growing worse as the algorithms are refined.","Jeff Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post and the founder and CEO of Amazon, has, like Google and some other major Silicon Valley corporations, close ties with the federal security and surveillance apparatus. Bezos has a $600 million contract with the CIA. The lines separating technology-based entities such as Google and Amazon and the government’s security and surveillance apparatus are often nonexistent. The goal of corporations such as Google and Facebook is profit, not the dissemination of truth. And when truth gets in the way of profit, truth is sacrificed.","Google, Facebook, Twitter, The New York Times, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, Agence France-Presse and CNN have all imposed or benefited from the algorithms or filters—overseen by human “evaluators.” When an internet user types a word in a Google search it is called an “impression” by the industry. These impressions direct the persons making the searches to websites that use the words or address the issues associated with them. Before the algorithms were put in place last April, searches for terms such as “imperialism” or “inequality” directed internet users mostly to left-wing, progressive and anti-war sites. Now they are directed primarily to mainstream sites such as The Washington Post. If you type in “World Socialist Web Site,” which has been hit especially hard by the algorithms, you will be directed to the site—but you have to ask for it by name. Searches for associated words such as “socialist” or “socialism” are unlikely to bring up a list in which the World Socialist Web Site appears near the top.","There are 10,000 “evaluators” at Google, many of them former employees at counterterrorism agencies, who determine the “quality” and veracity of websites. They have downgraded sites such as Truthdig, and with the abolition of net neutrality can further isolate those sites on the internet. The news organizations and corporations imposing and benefiting from this censorship have strong links to the corporate establishment and the Democratic Party. They do not question corporate capitalism, American imperialism or rising social inequality. They dutifully feed the anti-Russia hysteria. An Al-Jazeera report on this censorship begins at 14:07 in this link.","The corporate oligarchs, lacking a valid response to the discrediting of their policies of economic pillage and endless war, have turned to the blunt instrument of censorship and to a new version of red baiting. They do not intend to institute reforms or restore an open society. They do not intend to address the social inequality behind the political insurgencies in the two major political parties and the hatred of the corporate state that spans the political spectrum. They intend to impose a cone of silence and the state-sanctioned uniformity of opinion that characterizes all totalitarian regimes. This is what the use of FARA, the imposition of algorithms and the attempt to blame Trump’s election on Russian interference is about. Critics and investigative journalists who expose the inner workings of corporate power are branded enemies of the state in the service of a foreign power. The corporate-controlled media, meanwhile, presents the salacious, the trivial and the absurd as news while fanning the obsession over Russia. This is one of the most ominous moments in American history. The complicity in this witch hunt by self-identified liberal organizations, including The New York Times and MSNBC, will come back to haunt them. When the voices for truth are erased, they will be next.","The steps to tyranny are always small, incremental and often barely noticed, as Milton Mayer wrote in “They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-1945.” By the time a population wakes up, it is too late. He noted:","But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and the worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and the smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked. If, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the “German Firm” stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.","And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying “Jew swine,” collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you lived in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.","Despots, despite their proclaimed ideological, national and religious differences, speak the same language. Amoral, devoid of empathy and addicted to power and personal enrichment, they are building a world where all who criticize them are silenced, where their populations are rendered compliant by fear, constant surveillance and the loss of basic liberties and where they and their corporate enablers are the undisputed masters.","The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the Qatari government is seeking to improve relations with the Trump administration by forging alliances with right-wing Jewish organizations in the United States. It has promised Jewish leaders, the paper reported, not to air the Al-Jazeera documentary about the Israel lobby. Al-Jazeera in 2016 shut down Al-Jazeera America, which broadcast to U.S. audiences. With no broadcaster in the U.S., the program would have reached few American viewers even if Al-Jazeera had put it on the air.","Haaretz reported that Jewish organizational leaders who have visited Qatar in recent months include Mort Klein of the Zionist Organization of America; Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations; Jack Rosen of the American Jewish Congress; Rabbi Menachem Genack of the Orthodox Union; Martin Oliner of the Religious Zionists of America; and attorney Alan Dershowitz.","“What these leaders share is that none of them are considered critics of the right-wing Netanyahu government in Israel or the Trump administration in Washington,” Haaretz correspondent Amir Tibon wrote in the newspaper.","The despotism of the United States and the despotism of Israel have found an ally in the despotism of Qatar. Professed beliefs are meaningless. Israel is bonded with the regime in Saudi Arabia and the Christian right in the United States, each of which is virulently anti-Semitic. Dissidents, including Jewish and Israeli dissidents, are attacked as “self-hating Jews” or anti-Semites only because they are dissidents. The word “traitor” or “anti-Semite” has no real meaning. It is used not to describe a reality but to turn someone into a pariah. The iron wall is rising. It will cement into place a global system of corporate totalitarianism, one in which the old vocabulary of human rights and democracy is empty and where any form of defiance means you are an enemy of the state. This totalitarianism is being formed incrementally. It begins by silencing the demonized. It ends by silencing everyone.","“You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,” Bob Dylan sang in “Ballad of a Thin Man.” “You see somebody naked and you say, ‘Who is that man?’ You try so hard but you don’t understand just what you will say when you get home. Because something is happening here, but you don’t know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?”","This is the world we live in.

Visually, it looks like an ad-free stripped down version of Facebook that’s actually quite relaxing.","As I’m trying to reduce my exposure to social networks, I decided to take a look at this info. By extrapolating the data of a single individual (me), I might be able to better apprehend the capabilities of the beast. In the end, it all comes down to what is tracked and what can be deduced from that.","Limitless data storage period","I created my account Friday, September 14, 2007, at 10:59 am and all my actions have been recorded ever since. I feel that for the first time in history, 10 years of consistent human behavior have been meticulously gathered, stored & analyzed.","Exhaustive photo metadata","Whenever you post a photo to Facebook, it keeps a record of all the data that’s attached to it.

Well, every time you tag a photo, you’re adding to an enormous, user-drivenwealth of knowledge and data. Every day, billions of people are telling an algorithm what a human face looks like, from different angles, at different ages, and in different light conditions.","The result? Facebook allegedlysaidthat its image recognition models could recognize human faceswith98% accuracy& that it could identify a person inone picture out of 800 millionin less than five seconds.","Detailed contact list","When you install Facebook’s app on your phone, you give it the right to see your contact list. Once that’s done, Facebook keeps ALL your contacts information forever.","There’s no sneaky move here: the opt-in process on your phone is actually pretty clear about that. But seeing the phone numbers, emails & addresses of everyone you know (or knew) listed on Facebook is a bit disturbing.","Get to know your advertiser","… because he surely knows you.","Facebook main revenue source are ads served by their powerful targeting engine using custom audiences built for advertisers.","The thing is, Facebook’s been purposely mysterious about what type of information they share with third parties. Despitenumerous requestsby users throughout the world, their response is systematical:","Advertisers do not give Facebook any users’ contact details. We only get such details in hashed form and they are, in any event, deleted within 48 hours. We are therefore not able to confirm what contact information an advertiser has for a particular user.","So Facebook has a lot of data about you & it shares it with a lot of advertisers: but why should you care?","“Bring the world closer…”","… to ads.","I used to think there was no real drawback in ceding a lot of personal data to a 3rd party. After all, I get a free service that’s pleasant to use and really helpful.","Eventually, I realized that the harm potential really depends on 2 factors: the intentions and means of action of the organization that harvests your data.","Harm potential = money * financial KPI’s — regulatory pressure.","That’s where Facebook gets really frightening: it’s hugely powerful & its only objective is tomaximize the time spent & interactions made with its platform(just look at itsfinancial KPI’s).","Don’t be fooled by the “bring the world closer together” motto: if Facebook’s here, it’s only to make money by selling ads. And to do that, they must target — in the most precise manner — the highest possible amount of eyeballs.","The thing is, do we really care?","How to get your data?","Starting with Facebook in 2010 and followed by Google and Twitter in 2011 and 2012, big social networks began allowing their users to download a backup file of everything they’ve ever posted.","To download your Facebook backup, just follow the 3 steps describedhere.

Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged.","Acxiom said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March. The company currently expects revenue in the range of $910 million to $915 million in the 2018 fiscal year.","Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said.","Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users’ anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation.","Facebook’s shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook’s lifeblood, and lead to tougher regulation.","Figurines are seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018.

In a breathtaking piece of corporate casuistry, Facebook claims that this data harvest was not really a data breach at all, because the researcher who opened the floodgates did so 'in a legitimate way and through the proper channels.' The problem, they say, was that the individual in question didn’t abide by the company’s rules because he passed the information on to third parties. A senior Facebook executive told MPs that while the non-breach might have garnered lots of data, 'it is not data that we have provided.'\"","What a narrow, legalistic argument Facebook is making for itself! That's not going to work. We didn't give it to X. We gave it to Y who gave it to X. It's a laundering argument.","Facebook must have a substantive argument that they're choosing to hold in reserve: It's good to use this data to facilitate communication, especially on topics of great public concern.","[Mark Zuckerberg] has been obliged to follow in the footsteps of the hero of Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein – gradually forced to come to terms with the implications of the monster that he and his employees have created....","Shortly after Facebook became a public company, its founder famously exhorted his employees to “move fast and break things”. It was, of course, a hacker’s trope and, as such, touchingly innocent. What perhaps never occurred to Zuckerberg is that liberal democracy might be one of the things they break.","Can anyone explain why there is so much fear of targeted political advertising? If it's as dangerous as they act like they think then people are so weak-minded that democracy should be broken and we might as well let the machines take over.","So he has a meeting to try get his spin on things, he tells the Tillerson story because this gives him currency with them and they now know the hottest gossip, and the meeting breaks up and these reporters, being reporters, just have to gossip.

One obvious point is that Facebook wasn't frightening to progressives when Obama was using it so cleverly; it became frightening when Trump used it successfully.

In some cases it'd be conceivable the one campaign might not only pay for access to the data, but the denial of the data to others.","Since the stakes involve who controls the government, there's an even greater incentive for the monopolist to restrict that supply of data to one party over another, above and beyond the mere commercial incentive to garner so-called \"monopoly rents\".","The article I read about this last night said Cambridge Analytica used standard methods to do it's data mining - build a survey, get people to take it, and guess what, lots of those who took it had privacy settings that permitted Cambridge to look at all their Facebook contacts and grab all of that data.","That's how social media advertising works, geniuses.

The only concern regarding its use for political purposes is that it must be available to all who would use it for politics, else it is an effective monopoly putting its thumb on the political scales.","Worse is the filtering of speech. Facebook, Twitter and Google are already using their monopoly/cartel positions to put their thumbs on the scale in this respect. They have political preferences and are actively using their platforms to suppress their opponents speech.","Much worse is the already ongoing use of this sort of profile for sanctions agains political undesirables. China is beginning to implement this, and what Facebook and Google has can easily be turned to that purpose. And it obviously will be.","\"Facebook must have a substantive argument that they're choosing to hold in reserve: It's good to use this data to facilitate communication, especially on topics of great public concern.\"","-- That's the argument I've heard from techies who don't mind sharing their information. That the cost (advertisements and spam mails) is worth the benefit (seeing things they want more often).","But, when it comes to politics, I just don't trust large organizations not to use their power to shame and ruin me like they do with anyone who steps out of bounds. I don't mind that Facebook knows I like Magic the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons and am currently reading a bunch of non-fiction books interspersed with Phillip K. Dick and other science fiction.","I *do* care that they might think they know how I voted *and are willing to tell people what they think.* Remember the Althouse post where someone sent a \"here's how your neighborhood voted\" get out the vote mail?","Yeah.

I found the car (and we first communicated) via craigslist. After that it was all telephone and text messages. Once the transaction was complete, we had no further contact. A few months later she began showing up in Facebook friend recommendations.","When I look at the details of what Facebook thinks it knows about me in my profile, I'm not worried. It knows I'm in a family-based household and thinks I'm liberal, of all things, and that I own an iPhone 6. The first is because you define a family in your settings (ooh, spooky insight!) and the last is a standard handshake ANY site does with any client (what is the browser/app and what OS?). So the one thing that requires any sort of even moderately subtle AI discrimination they got 100% dead wrong.","“Can anyone explain why there is so much fear of targeted political advertising?

In a post on (what else) Facebook, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth gave variations on the line we’ve come to expect from tech in these situations: They’re not supposed to do that, and anyway how could we have known?","“This is the opposite of our business model,” he wrote. “Our interests are aligned with users when it comes to protecting data.” What reason could you possibly have to be skeptical of this declamation?","He said much more than that, of course, and very earnestly indeed, but if you cut through the prevarication here’s the simplified timeline:","Facebook deliberately allows developers to collect a bunch of data from users who authorize it, plus a bunch of their friends. (But developers have to promise they won’t use it in certain ways.)","Shady people take advantage of this choice and collect as much data as possible for use off the Facebook network in ways Facebook can’t predict or control. (The quiz app in question is surely just one of many — this was an incredible opportunity for data snatchers.)","Facebook fails to predict or control use of the data it released, and fails to protect users who never even knew their data had been released. (It also fails to learn that it has failed to control it.)","The rest is noise, as far as I’m concerned. Even if anyone really believes that sharing data about users is not the Facebook business model, who cares what its business model is?

Oh no! Who would have thought someone would do that? The real question was what was Facebook expecting when it handed out data on millions essentially on the honor system?","Facebook’s business model is monetizing your data (the data you give it, it must be said), one way or the other.

The core challenge was to identify the floating/swing voters for each of the parties and to measure their levels electoral apathy, a result of the poor and unchanging condition of the state after 15 years of incumbent rule.”","It then goes on to add that “In addition to the research phase, CA were tasked to organise the party base at the village level by creating a communication hierarchy to increase supporter motivation. Our client achieved a landslide victory, with over 90% of total seats targeted by CA being won”.","In the 243 seat Bihar assembly, JDU had won 115 seats while its ally BJP had won 91 seats in the 2010 polls. The opposition party RJD, led by Laloo Yadav, won a meagre 22 seats while its ally, Congress party had won only 4 seats. Although JDU and RJD combined together in 2015 to win the Bihar assembly polls, JDU’s Nitish Kumar switched sides last year to go with Narendra Modi’s BJP.","Cambridge Analytica, a company created by Robert Mercer, a billionaire patron of right-wing outlets like Breitbart News in the US, has been swallowing up all the data they can get. It has collected data from Facebook – illegally as we now know — and Twitter and has purchased a lot of other data — about television preferences, travel, shopping, public events attended, movies watched, books bought and so on — from third-party organisations and so-called data brokers.","It then combines this social psychology with data analytics, and uses it for something the company calls “behavioral microtargeting” — basically individualized advertising targeting every single voter by using psychometrics. Rather than assuming all people in the same age group or of the same gender will respond to the same message, they target individual voters with emotionally charged content — in other words, advertisements and messages designed to tug on emotional biases.","The strategy has clearly been a success globally but few know that the company was employed by the BJP and JDU in Bihar in 2010 itself.

The average Facebook user may not be truly concerned with fancy terms such as psychological voter profiling to sway elections. However, you may want to know what data Facebook scrapes from its users and what it does with this information.","Following the data scandal that rocked the social media giant, CEO Mark Zuckerberg came out with a statement explaining the timeline of events. To sum it up, Facebook shifted blame on Cambridge Analytica for having illegally obtained data from Facebook users to build voter profiles. To address the privacy concerns, Facebook stated that it will become stringent with App permissions henceforth.","What info does Facebook have on you?","To find out, head over to settings and click on \"Download a copy\" of your Facebook data. The process takes minutes to hours and will prompt you with a dialogue box/email once it is ready for download.","In general, Facebook collects information such as contact information, events, friends, messages, photos, security, timeline, videos. The messages folder contains information extracted from Facebook Messenger and includes the actual conversations with friends. The photos and videos folder display all media content uploaded on the website.","How did Facebook get this information?","The Android operating system is partly to blame with respect to app permissions. Facebook Messenger and Facebook Lite allow users to upload contact information that is stored on its servers. Facebook does this as part of its friend recommendation algorithm. The earlier versions of Android allowed Facebook to source call logs and SMS logs in addition to contact information due to the way permissions were structured. Also read: How to disable third-party apps on Facebook: Stop these apps from collecting your personal information","Users who allowed Facebook to upload their contact information may have inadvertently given permission to access their call and SMS logs by default. While the permission structure was later changed in Android API in version 16, applications could still be written earlier versions of the API, and as a result, Facebook API could still access the call and SMS data by targetting an earlier version of the Android SDK version. Google later made changes to the API in October 2017 which patched the access. It is important to note that Apple iOS never allowed this access on its operating system.","How to stop Facebook from accessing your contact information?","Users can visit to see what contacts have been uploaded to Facebook servers. Permission for uploading contacts has been accessed through Facebook Messenger. To stop Facebook from continuously syncing contacts and delete all of your previously uploaded contacts from Messenger, users can follow these steps:","On Android, go to Facebook Messenger. From Home, tap your profile picture in the top right corner. Tap People and tap Sync contacts to turn on/off the setting.","On iPhone or iPad, from Home, tap your profile picture in the top left corner. Tap People and then tap Sync contacts to turn on/off the feature.","What does Facebook have to say to defend itself against the allegations?","\"Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about and provides you with a better experience on Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted.

Once you sign in to your Google account on a web browser, head to here. First off, don’t get alarmed — all of this information is visible only to you (after signing in).

This ‘bundle’ page has everything you’ve done, including searches you’ve made, what areas you saw on Maps and what apps you downloaded. On the same page, click on My Account to get an overview. On this page, we recommend you initiate the Security and Privacy checkups — you’ll see some settings here that you might want to change.Here is a creative account of penetration-testing a cyber-security firm did on one of the world's largest banks and what it tells us about internet safety.","If you use YouTube, head to - here, you’ll see a list of every search you’ve made on YouTube and every video you’ve watched.

You can view all of these (and individually revoke access) by heading to this page. Finally, you can control the information Google uses to show you personalised ads. To toggle this on/off, head to this page. The downside of this is that the ads you see might not be relevant to you — but at least it stops Google from sharing this info about you with advertisers. If you’d rather leave this setting on, scroll down to see the interests. Remove the topics/interests that are not relevant to you and you’ll start seeing some differences in a few days.","Delete Contacts from FacebookFirst, you need to make sure that you’re not uploading your contacts to Facebook.

But the recent reports raise new questions about the role Facebook played in protecting user data, and reveal more about the scope and methods the firm used to acquire it.","The revelations were published by The Observer, which based its reporting on testimony and data provided by Christopher Wylie, an analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica.","“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,” he toldThe Guardian. “And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Here’s Wylie in an interview with The Guardian:","Facebook’s role in harvesting user data","In 2014, a psychologist named Aleksandr Kogan developed an app called thisisyourdigitallife. The app was essentially a personality quiz based on the Big 5 model of personality, which measures the traits openness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, agreeableness, and extraversion.","The approximately 32,000 users who took the quiz agreed to the terms of the app, which stated that it would collect basic data about the users and, importantly, the friends in their network. However, the friends of the test-takers didn’t consent to having their data harvested.","Facebook’s “platform policy” allows apps to collect data from app-users’ friends—only if it’s used to improve the experience of the app. Selling or distributing user data to advertisers, however, is prohibited.","As early as 2015, Facebook discovered that Kogan had passed along that trove of user data—which was estimated to include information on anywhere from 30 to 50 million users—to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook removed the quiz app from its platform that year and requested that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica destroy the data.","“I already had,” Wylie said. “But literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it. Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.”","That seems to be the extent of what Facebook did to remediate the situation.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing,” Wylie said. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Wylie tweeted on Sunday that Facebook had suspended his account.","“Suspended by Facebook. For blowing the whistle. On something they have known privately for two years.”","On Saturday, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that it didn’t use data from the personality-quiz app as part of its work in the 2016 presidential election.","On Monday afternoon, the U.K.’s Channel 4 released an exposé on Cambridge Analytica. The data firm had reportedly tried, unsuccessfully, to block its airing.","Infographics show the classes and anxieties in the supposedly classless U.S. economy.","For those of us who follow politics, we’re used to commentators referring to the President’s low approval rating as a surprise given the U.S.'s “booming” economy. This seeming disconnect, however, should really prompt us to reconsider the measurements by which we assess the health of an economy. With a robust U.S. stock market and GDP and low unemployment figures, it’s easy to see why some think all is well. But looking at real U.S. wages, which have remained stagnant—and have, thus, in effect gone down given rising costs from inflation—a very different picture emerges. For the 1%, the economy is booming. For the rest of us, it’s hard to even know where we stand. A recent study by Porch (a home-improvement company) of blue-collar vs. white-collar workers shows how traditional categories are becoming less distinct—the study references \"new-collar\" workers, who require technical certifications but not college degrees.

Advance polling suggests Putin boasts about 70 percent support, though critics say Russian elections are a pseudo-democratic exercise with a predetermined outcome. Apathetic voters are under increased pressure to turn out this year, with some employers asking workers to provide proof that they voted.

The talks are seen as a preliminary step toward the direct meeting President Trump has said he will have with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this spring.

Turkey's war on the Kurds creates tension with Washington, which is allied with both sides. The YPG joined the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State, but Ankara, a NATO ally, considers the Kurds terrorists because of their links to Kurdish rebels in Turkey.\n[BBC News, Bloomberg]","8.","Remains of all 6 Florida bridge collapse victims recovered","After three days of work to clear tons of rubble from the pedestrian bridge that collapsed in Miami, Florida, on Thursday, officials said Saturday night they have finally recovered the remains of all six victims. \"We believe that we've recovered the final two individuals, final two victims, from underneath the bridge,\" said Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez. \"Although we expected that perhaps we may find more [than six], thankfully, we did not,\" he added. \"We are pretty confident that no one is left.\" The National Transportation Safety Board continues to investigate the cause of the collapse.\n[CNN, NBC News]","9.","Single $457 million Powerball ticket sold in Pennsylvania","A single winning Powerball ticket scored the entire $457 million jackpot in Pennsylvania on Saturday, a prize with a cash value of about $274 million.

Net net, I rarely have a losing week, market up, market down. And that I owe to you. Balanced positions. More premium sold than bought. Fundamental criteria applied to good companies, not momentum/ news headlines/ stock du jour/ triangle squeezies. But rather earnings, P/E, dividends, competitive position — the boring stuff that takes study, thought,….and patience. You have been a great teacher, and I have embarassed myself repeatedly day with how slowly I learn.\nAnd it's a funny thing – if you don't lose, the gains start to pile up. The arithmetic is cruel to the downside, and becomes a gift in the other direction. And I'm in this for the long run, having made myself unemployable through a need for diversification. Moreover, what I've learned here has also elided into other areas, including real estate and ex-U.S. investment. Pretty cool.

He sees things that others miss and he's one of the best at finding price anomalies. When he makes a mistake, he has an exit strategy already planned. He hedges very well and he has an instict which tells him to go to cash or to be all in.","Autolander","Oxen (directly) and Wilkinson (indirectly) are making me a great day trader!

You never cease to amaze me with your thoughtful perspective on a myriad of different issues and challenges. It's kind of an embarrassment of riches since I joined this board a few years back.

Took all of 10 minutes! I want to thank you for helping me not just learn a bit about trading, but giving me some confidence and most of all a rewarding \"hobby\" to look forward to each day. I have had a few mistakes and losses along the way, but I have had some great wins too and I am now consistently making money trading futures and have even learned to go to sleep while holding a losing position knowing that tomorrow is always another opportunity to win again.

The tax proposal ensnares companies that sell digital advertising (GOOGL, FB, TWTR) or provide a platform for online trade between third parties (AMZN, EBAY, UBER?). This exempts such firms as brick-and-mortar department stores that sell designer handbags over their websites, no matter how digital the transactions look.","This is what a trade war looks like, folks – tariffs and taxes flying about everywhere and randomly huting the profits of companies you invested in – it's not good for the markets and no one ends up winning in the end – and that end can get very, very messy (see WWII).","So we have the Fed tightening and higher taxes and trade wars and the question I ask you is: \"Is this the right environment to be paying all-time highs for stocks?\" If the anwser is no – then you need to seriously go through your portfolio and consider which of your stocks may be overpriced and, of course, make sure you are well-hedged!","I may have forgotten to mention a President that may be indicted next month and the usual possible Government shutdown on Friday but those are business as usual these days and we're already trained to ignore them, right?","The Big Bear Signal for today would be the Nasdaq failing the 50-day moving average at 6,824 and it looks like we'll open below it with a 100-point drop so now the question is whether or not we get back over it before the Russell (/RTY) fails it's 50 dma at 1,557.

It is much appreciated, and invaluable. Your hit rate of successful trades has been very high in my 1.5 months as a member, but even more importantly is your teaching of how to repair and DD positions that haven't gone your way yet. As with most members, we all have our ‘pet' trading interests, and learning how to think about trading is much more important than a specific trade, which could see the conditions behind it change an hour later.

It really let me see how you look at the numbers and use the 5% rule to see where inflection points occur and what the bands look like. This was incredibly helpful. I actually sold out of my small short position at a good profit ( which was more a bet on a short term fluctuation rather than a hedge after listening to you) and will look more deeply at my portfolio and how to hedge it. In addition your view on hedging was also very helpful looking at the leverage you can get w/ a small spread, and protect portfolio against a big move against me. Thank you for your sharing this.

Two years ago I'd wake up early and my heart would race if futures weren't pointing exactly how I wanted… I've noticed an exponential leap in my discipline skills especially over this past two weeks. The old me would have ran with that trade for profits without even asking. Now I know that there are ALWAYS more trades and that I have PLENTY of options to turn a bad trade even. Also, it's more logical and less emotionally draining which lets me focus my faculties on my wife, college, my job, and studying for the ol' Series 7. Would it be safe to say that one of the most important skills to develop is the ability to adjust? I'd love to get to the point where I can look at a bracket and know, for example, what I need to sell for cover in what month in order to get my desired results. Both COF and my past DMM venture have been excellent learning experiences. Thanks, everyone.

I attribute this not to investment choices, but to style. Thanks to you and others on this site I'm paying close attention to position size, delta neutrality, downside protection, and concentrating on selling premium rather than buying it. I've developed increasing patience, not having to trade daily, or even weekly. I'm concentrating on the finer points of trading, letting the profits come to me, rather than the other way around.

ETP that can provide 60%+ over two years with an armchair trade (13.4% div yield but declining divs and higher risks).","Getting another leg down after not much bounce. Same old lines as usual on the way to 2,640, as promised:","Good call State!","MLPX/Learner – Sounds good but have to look at what it is they actually do. Kind of funny that they were specifically designed to take advantage of MLP regs. I like the LNG angle but they have their fingers in all sorts of pockets – which may be a plus, actually.","MLPs/BDC – I just hand crap to my accountant but I don't think it's terrible, they just send you a 1099 for the income.","Trump v Biden/Malsg – I would not mess with Biden and Trump is kind of like a bowl of jelly – those bone spurs make it hard to stay in shape so Biden in round one!","President Donald Trump is planning to levy tariffs on about $50 billion of imports from China, as well as impose restrictions on technology transfers and acquisitions by Beijing to pressure China to curtail what the U.S. considers unfair trading and investment practices.34813 minutes ago","As noted on StJ's Dow chart, the 15% line is 24,150 and we bounced right off that and that's down from the 20% line at 25,200 so call it an even 1,000 points and look for 200-point bounces back to 24,350 (weak) and 24,550 (strong)","KHC/State – Nice boring company and seems cheap at $61.50, which is $75Bn on $26Bn in sales and $11Bn in profits (who'd have thought they have that much mark-up?) but that's misleading as it includes $5.5Bn in tax benefits and, realistically, I'd look for more like $4Bn+ in profit so call the p/e more like 15-18.","The bottom line is they never should have been in the 90s and this price is about fair but I wouldn't say it's so cheap I can't stay away.","However, in the LTP, we love boring and we can sell 10 of the KHC 2020 $57.50 puts for $5.50 ($5,500) just to put some money in our pocket and the worst case is owning them at net $52, which is 18% lower than we are now.","This week, Trump added Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney who has been highly critical of the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ), to his outside legal team. With Dowd gone, Trump’s outside legal team handling the Russia matter will be led, at least in the interim, by diGenova and Jay Sekulow.","Also, Dowd may have to give testimony against Trump now:","Dowd’s predicament arose after Washington was set alight by what may be the single most moronic tweet in the checkered tweet history of the administration. The president sent out a tweet responding former national security adviser Michael Flynn's plea agreement by saying “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the vice president and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”","The three words “and the FBI” could constitute an admission against interest for the president in the investigation of possible obstruction of justice. Flynn was “fired” on Feb. 13, 2017. That was the day before Trump reportedly asked then FBI Director James Comey to ask him to go easy on Flynn. (Trump has denied that he ever asked Comey to drop the investigation against Flynn.)","With the media in full frenzy, Dowd came forward to fall on a sword. He claimed that the words were his alone and he was “sloppy” in referring to knowledge of lying to the FBI. However, this week media is reporting that White House Counsel Don McGahn told Trump before Flynn was fired that he believed Flynn had misled the FBI.","It is hard to imagine how Dowd could ethically continue to perform his duties as an attorney after compromising himself and his client so thoroughly. Dowd is now an obvious potential witness for special counsel Robert Mueller. There is no reason why Mueller should accept his claim that Trump did not approve these words or that the admission did not reflect Trump’s knowledge at the time of the Flynn firing in February.","This was the wrong time and the wrong prosecutor for Dowd to push the envelope of attorney-client privilege. Mueller has already shown a troubling and dismissive view of legal privilege. He was accused of trying unsuccessfully to nail a defense lawyer by taping an attorney-client meeting in Boston when he was U.S. Attorney. More recently, Mueller effectively turned Paul Manafort's former lawyer, Melissa Laurenza, into a witness against him; he got a court order for her testimony under the “crime-fraud exception.”","Since Mueller is investigating obstruction of justice, Dowd’s testimony would be easier to acquire then Laurenza’s. Moreover, it is not clear what role Dowd was performing as tweet muse. Lawyers are under various ethical limitations in discussing pending cases or investigations or witnesses. It is not clear how a lawyer can issue statements under the name of the client without approval or a clear understanding from the client. This was not a tweet from counsel speaking on behalf of Trump. It was speaking as Trump.","Writing under the name of your client (without his sign-off on the statement) raises a novel but no less troubling concern, particularly when you are attacking a potential witness against your client. Dowd seemed to blur the line of counsel with being a type of public relations flack in authoring tweets under Trump’s name. While it is always dangerous to combine the roles of lawyer and flack, it becomes intolerable when you add the third role as potential witness.","Calling this “sloppy” drafting is like calling the Titanic “incautious navigation.” Dowd seriously undermined the position of Trump by clearing away any serious barrier for Mueller to demand information on his communications with Trump.","So many scandals, we forget that one from last month.","GME/Maya – Well, if I understand correctly, you sold $20 puts AND calls for a total of $5, right? Assuming it's 2020, the $20 calls are now $1.20 and the puts are $8.50 so the same net and that assignment of more at $20 still looms so I would not dive in so hard, so fast.","The dividend is 0.38 and they just paid March so next is June and you get 1,000 for $380.","If you cash the stock for $14 ($14,000) and roll the short $20 puts ($8,500) to 20 of the short 2020 $13 puts at $3.50 ($7,000) and roll the 10 short $20 calls ($1,200) to 15 short 2020 $15 calls at $2.20 ($3,300) you would be in for your original net -$20,000 + $14,000 - $8,500 + $7,000 – $1,200 + $3,300 = -$5,400 and now you can buy 20 $10 calls for $4.50 ($9,000) and that puts you in 20 of the 2020 $10/15 bull call spreads for $14,400 and it's a $10,000 spread but 1/4 uncovered and you can make up the $4,400 by selling 10 July $16 calls for 0.75 ($750) while you wait.","If GME starts doing well, then the puts go worthless and you can add more longs or roll the short calls higher to widen the spread and, if GME tanks, you are assigned 2,000 shares at $13 ($26,000) plus your loss (assuming it's total) puts you in 2,000 at $20 as your worst case but that's more effective than doubling down now to average $17 and you have an excellent chance to get even at just $15 without dumping a ton of cash into the trade.","CTL/Albo – True they are only down 40% while FTR is down 65% but I'm more of a glass is 1/3 full kind of guy…","That is cool, BDC.","TCEHY/Scott – I stay away from them because I simply don't believe the numbers. If they are true, they are amazing though:","That's not what I see in their quarterlies, where sales are more like $10.8Bn and EPS is 0.32 for 5.42Bn shares ($1.734Bn) and there I have trouble justifying a $500Bn valuation but I can't figure out what the truth is so – I just stay away….","BAC/Dave – I like them too but C got cheap first. If BAC pulls back a bit more, I'd like them too.","/RB/Rayne – It's its own animal but often it follows oil. I think it's just another chance to short as I simply don't see people paying more at the pump without cutting back but, as I keep saying, VERY dangerous into the holiday weekend next week and I made my money so I'm content to wait a week rather than waste a week starting at it trying to convince myself it's safe to jump in again.","Dow looks like it's going to re-test the lows. Ugly rebuke of trade policy if it fails 24,150.","With copper, if we throw out the spike to $3.30 and call $3.25 the move up (which makes sense as it's the 30% line from $2.50) then we have an 0.25 fall that gets 0.05 bounces to $3.05 (weak) and $3.10 (strong). I think today we have a weak bounce (this week, actually) that is consolidating for a move down.","The market jolted lower in Dec when copper last took a dive but not too much effect compared to the madness we've had recently. I just think it's yet another bad sign that will cause meetings that cause trading houses to flip their tradebots to SELL mode and, as I have often noted – there simply aren't enough real buyers around to sell to and the market can drop very, very fast.","DXD/Dave – That's not weird, that's how it works. That kind of spread only really protects you if the Dow goes down AND STAYS DOWN. Of course, if it goes down and comes back – your positions improve and you don't need the hedge. The reason we put DXD in the STP for July is that I do expect us to be lower in July than we are now but, in between, they losses will mostly cancel out the gains.","Trade policy / Phil – What trade policy? Right now, all we have is Trump deciding what he thinks is best without consulting his advisors. Not that asking Kudlow would help as far as the economy is going but he might actually have 20-30 IQ points on Trump (low bar I know).","LOL StJ – A very low bar indeed. I can't believe Trump wants to be in a room with that guy. Kudlow is like nails on a chalk board to me – between the sound of his voice and the intelligence-insulting BS he spouts – I can't even keep the sound on when he's on TV.","Speaking of Trump idiots, Wilbur Ross was trying to defend the trade war on Bloomberg and said that China was doing $500Bn worth of damage to the US and then the woman asks him – \"So how do $50Bn worth of tariffs make a dent in that?\" and then someone interjected that the Tariffs are only a 25%(ish) tax on $50Bn worth of goods, so really $12.5Bn out of \"$500Bn in damages\" – in other words, complete and utter, pointless bullshit!","Also, Trump has no actual tariff plan – what they are saying is they are going to \"take suggestions\" from US manufacturers who want to get even with China as to which items to tax. So his plan is to play let's make a deal for months – something that will line a LOT of pockets for people seeking access to plead their tariff case.","Welcome to Trump World!","2.5% rule on /ES and /NQ. /YM already down 3% and /RTY is lagging at -2.2%.","MU beat, but stock is down 5% AH (recovered from 10% down).

Not so controversial.","The case studies that Facebook used to list from political campaigns, however, included more interesting claims. Facebook’s work with Florida’s Republican Gov.

Britain's information commissioner announced today that she is seeking a warrant to search the company's office and servers for any evidence of illegal activity.","It's been an eventful few days for the data firm. The drama all began over the weekend with an internal whistleblower coming forward to say that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the personal data on 50 million Facebook users through a method that violated Facebook's terms of service. Then, on Monday, the UK's Channel 4 ran the second part of an ongoing investigation into Cambridge Analytica's shady political practices.","The segment from Channel 4 featured undercover video of a man identified as Cambridge Analytica's chief executive, Alexander Nix, speaking with reporters he believed to be potential clients. From Channel 4:","In one exchange, when asked about digging up material on political opponents, Mr Nix said they could \"send some girls around to the candidate's house\", adding that Ukrainian girls \"are very beautiful, I find that works very well\".","In another he said: \"We'll offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance, we'll have the whole thing recorded, we'll blank out the face of our guy and we post it on the Internet.\"","Offering bribes to public officials is an offence under both the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Cambridge Analytica operates in the UK and is registered in the United States.","After the segment aired, Britain's Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, appeared for an interview with Channel 4's Jon Snow. Denham said that her office \"has been carrying out an investigation into data analytics and political profiling and micro-targeting for several months now. And we have heard similar allegations during our investigation.\"","The commissioner emphasised that Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are only one part of their investigation, which involves 30 organisations and was started with the intent of explaining to the public what happens to their personal data during political campaigning. Denham said that she issued a demand for access to Cambridge Analytica on March 7 and that she was not satisfied with its response. She said that her office will formally request the warrant tomorrow, and she is seeking access to the computers and property of the firm.","Facebook's own forensic investigators were going to conduct an independent review of Cambridge Analytica's systems, according to an announcement today.","However, Facebook has confirmed that auditors from Stroz Friedberg, the digital forensics firm it hired to conduct the probe of Cambridge Analytica's servers, were asked to leave by UK authorities. \"At the request of the UK Information Commissioner's Office, which has announced it is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation, the Stroz Friedberg auditors stood down,\" Facebook said in a statement.","Denham said that \"Facebook has been cooperative with us and has provided a great deal of information about the 50 million profiles. We're waiting on more information, but it's Cambridge Analytica that has been uncooperative with our investigation.\"","We've reached out to Cambridge Analytica for comment but did not receive an immediate reply. Considering how much emphasis the man identified as Nix in the video puts on client privacy, we're going to go out on a limb and guess that the company isn't very pleased.","The Washington Post reported on Monday that \"Cambridge Analytica earned more than $16 million [$AU21 million] from 2014 to 2016 from nearly 20 Republican candidates and political committees\".

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Montgomery, School of Communication, American University, Washington, DC, United States of America\nPUBLISHED ON: 31 Dec 2017 DOI: 10.14763/2017.4.773","Abstract","Computational politics—the application of digital targeted-marketing technologies to election campaigns in the US and elsewhere—are now raising the same concerns for democratic discourse and governance that they have long raised for consumer privacy and welfare in the commercial marketplace. This paper examines the digital strategies and technologies of today’s political operations, explaining how they were employed during the most recent US election cycle, and exploring the implications of their continued use in the civic context. The paper concludes with a discussion of recent policy proposals designed to increase transparency and accountability in digital politics.","Introduction","Political campaigns in the United States have employed digital technologies for more than a decade, developing increasingly sophisticated tools and techniques during each election cycle, as “computational politics” have become standard operating procedure (Tufecki, 2014; Kreiss, 2016). However, the most recent election marked a critical turning point, as candidates, political action committees, and other interest groups were able to take advantage of significant breakthroughs in data-driven marketing techniques, such as cross-device targeting, developed since the previous presidential election (“Bernie Sanders”, 2016; Edelman Digital, 2016). Electoral politics has now become fully integrated into a growing, global commercial digital media and marketing ecosystem that has already transformed how corporations market their products and influence consumers (Chahal, 2013; LiveRamp, 2015; Rubinstein, 2014; Schuster, 2015).The strategies, technologies, and tools of digital political marketing are more complex and far-reaching than anything we have seen before, with further innovations already underway (WARC, 2017). But because most commercial and political digital operations take place below the radar, they are not fully understood by the public. 1","In the following pages, we briefly describe the growth and maturity of digital marketing, highlighting its basic features, key players, and major practices. We then document how data-driven digital marketing has moved into the centre of American political operations, along with a growing infrastructure of specialised firms, services, technologies and software systems. We identify the prevailing digital strategies, tactics, and techniques of today’s political operations, explaining how they were employed during the most recent US election cycle. Finally, we explore the implications of their use for democratic discourse and governance, discussing several recent policy developments aimed at increasing transparency and accountability in digital politics.","Our research for this paper draws from our extensive experience tracking the growth of digital marketing over the past two decades in the United States and abroad, monitoring and analysing key technological developments, major trends, practices and players, and assessing the impact of these systems in areas such as health, financial services, retail, and youth (Chester, 2007; Montgomery, 2007; Montgomery, Chester, & Kopp, 2017). During the 2016 US presidential election, we monitored commercial digital advertising and data use by candidates, parties and special interest groups across the political spectrum. We collected examples of these ads, along with technical and market impact information from the developers of the applications. We also reviewed trade journals, research reports, and other industry documents, and attended conferences that were focused on digital technologies and politics. In the process, we identified all of the major providers of political digital data targeting applications (e.g., Google, Facebook, data clouds, ad agencies) and analysed all their key materials and case studies related to their 2016 operations. The source for much of this work was our ongoing gathering and analysis of cross-sectional commercial digital marketing practices worldwide.","Marriage of politics and commerce","Since the mid-20th century, advertising has been an increasingly powerful and pervasive presence in US political campaigns, as a growing cadre of ad agencies, public relations firms, and consultants perfected the use of opinion polls, focus groups, and psychographics to reach and influence voters through radio, television, direct mail, and other media outlets (A. Jamieson, 2016; K. H. Jamieson, 1996; Sabato, 1981). With the rise of the internet, campaign operatives began to harness digital technologies and tools to mobilize voter turnout, engage young people, raise money, and support grassroots ground operations (Karpf, 2016; Kreiss, 2016; Tufecki, 2014). Both major political parties in the United States developed large, sophisticated data and digital operations (Kreiss, 2016).","Many of the digital strategies, tools, and techniques employed in the 2016 election were initially developed, deployed, tested, and refined by the commercial sector (Tufecki, 2014).Since its origins in the mid-1990s, digital marketing has operated with a core business model that relies on continuous data collection and monitoring of individual online behaviour patterns (Montgomery, 2011). This system emerged in the United States amid a political culture of minimal government interference, and within a prevailing laissez-faire ethos regarding the internet and new technologies (Barlow, 1996). In the earliest days of the “dot-com boom”, a strong political alliance was forged between the digital media companies and their partners in the advertising and media business, enabling the nascent industry to effectively ward off any attempts to restrain its business operations through privacy regulation or other public policies (Solon & Siddiqui, 2017). As a consequence, the advertising industry played a central role in shaping the operations of platforms and applications in the digital media ecosystem. Digital marketing is now well established and thriving, with expenditures reaching nearly $72.5bn in 2016 for the US alone, and worldwide spending predicted to reach more than $223bn this year (eMarketer, 2017; IAB, n.d.-d).","Ongoing innovations over the years have increased the capacity of data and digital marketing applications. Data collection, analysis, and targeting were further woven into the daily lives of consumers with the rise of social media platforms and mobile devices. Because of the unique role that they play in users’ lives, these platforms are able to sweep up enormous amounts of information, including not only what users post about themselves, but also what is collected from them throughout their daily activities (Smith, 2014). A growing arsenal of software and analytic tools has enhanced the ability of digital media companies and their advertisers to glean valuable insights from the oceans of data they generate (Smith, 2014). Predictive analytics introduced an expanded set of tools for scoring, rating, and categorising individuals, based on an increasingly granular set of behavioural, demographic, and psychographic data (“What is Predictive Intelligence”, 2017). US digital marketers have helped popularise and spur the successful adoption of digital advertising platforms and applications in nearly every geographical location with an internet connection or a link to a mobile device (IAB, n.d.-c). Google, Facebook, and other major players in the digital marketing industry have also developed a global research infrastructure to allow them, and especially their major advertising clients, to make continuous improvements in reaching and influencing the public, and to measure with increasing accuracy the success of their efforts (Facebook IQ, n.d.-a). These developments have created what some observers have called the “surveillance economy” (Singer, 2012).","The growth of data-driven political marketing","Though political campaigns have employed micro-targeting techniques—which use an array of personalised and other data sets and marketing applications to influence the actions of individuals—during the last several election cycles, recent technological innovations and industry advances have created a much more robust system than what was in place in 2012 (IAB, n.d.-b; Rubinstein, 2014). For years, political campaigns have been able to combine public voter files with commercial information from data brokers, to develop detailed and comprehensive dossiers on American voters (Rubinstein, 2014). With recent advances in the advertising technology and data industries, they can now take advantage of a growing infrastructure of specialty firms offering more extensive resources for data mining and targeting voters. Among the new entities are data marketing clouds. Developed by well-known companies such as Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, Nielsen, and IBM, these clouds sell political data along with an exhaustive amount of detailed consumer information for each potential target, including, for example, credit card use, personal interests, consumption patterns, and TV viewing patterns (Salesforce DMP, 2017).","Some of these massive cloud services also operate what has become a new and essential component for contemporary digital targeting—the data management platform (DMP) (Chavez, 2017). DMPs provide marketers with “centralized control of all of their audience and campaign data” (BlueKai, 2011). They do this by collecting and analysing data about individuals from a wide variety of online and offline sources, including first-party data from a customer’s own record, such as the use of a supermarket loyalty card, or their activities captured on a website, mobile phone, or wearable device; second-party data, information collected about a person by another company, such as an online publisher, and sold to others; and third-party data drawn from thousands of sources, comprising demographic, financial, and other data-broker information, including race, ethnicity, and presence of children (O’Hara, 2016). All of this information can be matched to create highly granular “target audience segments” and to identify and “activate” individuals “across third party ad networks and exchanges”. DMPs are quickly becoming a critical tool for political campaigns (Bennett, 2016; Kaye, 2016, July; Regan, J., 2016).","Facebook and Google now play a central role in political operations, offering a full spectrum of commercial digital marketing tools and techniques, along with specialied ad “products” designed for political use (Bond, 2017). Not surprisingly, these companies have also made generating revenues from political campaigns an important “vertical” category within their ad business (Facebook, n.d.-d; Facebook IQ, n.d.-b; Stanford, 2016). Facebook’s role in the 2016 election was particularly important. With users required to give their real names when they sign up as members, Facebook has created a powerful “identity-based” targeting paradigm, enabling political campaigns to access its more than 162 million US users and to target them individually by age, gender, congressional district, and interests (Facebook, n.d.-b).Its online guide for political campaign marketing urges political campaigns to use all the social media platform tools it makes available to advertisers—including through Instagram and other properties—in order to track individuals, capture their data through various “lead-generation” tactics, and target them by uploading voter files and other data (Facebook, n.d.-a-c-f). The company also employs teams of internal staff aligned with each of the major political parties to provide technical assistance and other services to candidates and their campaigns (Chester, 2017; Kreiss & Mcgregor, 2017). Google heavily promoted the use of YouTube, as well as its other digital marketing assets, during the 2016 US election, reaching out to both major political parties (YouTube, 2017).","The growth and increasing sophistication of the digital marketplace has enhanced the capacities of political campaigns to identify, reach, and interact with individual voters. Below we identify seven key techniques that are emblematic of this new digital political marketing system, providing brief illustrations of how they were employed during the 2016 election.","Cross-device targeting","Getting a complete picture of a person’s persistent “identity” through an “identity-graph” has become a key strategy for successfully reaching consumers across their “omnichannel” experience (use of mobile, TV, streaming devices, etc.) (Winterberry Group, 2016). “Cross-device recognition” allows marketers to determine if the same person who is on a social network is also using a personal computer and later watching video on a mobile phone. Through data “onboarding,” a customer record that may contain a physical and email address is linked through various matching processes, associating it with what is believed to be that individual’s online identification—cookies, IP addresses, and other persistent identifiers (Levine, 2016). Cross-device targeting is now a standard procedure for political initiatives and other campaigns. Voter files are uploaded into the onboarding process, enabling the campaigns to find their targets on mobile devices and at specific times when they may be more receptive to a message (Kaye, 2016, April; L2, n.d.-b). Such granularity of information also enables a more tailored advertisement—so-called “dynamic creative”—which can be changed over time to “deliver very specific messaging” to individuals (Schuster, 2015). Leading cross-device marketing company Drawbridge offered a suite of election services in 2016 that provided campaigns a number of ways to impact voters, including through “Voter-Centric Cross Device Storytelling”, “Political Influencer Identification”, and via “Real-Time Voter Attribution Measurement” (Drawbridge, n.d.).","Programmatic advertising","Programmatic advertising refers to new automated forms of ad buying and placement on digital media using computer programmes and algorithmic processes to find and target a customer wherever she goes. The process can also involve real-time “auctions” that occur in milliseconds in order to “show an ad to a specific customer, in a specific context” (Allen, 2016). The use of programmatic advertising was one of the major changes in political campaign digital operations between 2012 and 2016—“the first time in American History”, according to one ad company, “that such precise targeting has ever been made available at such great scale” (Briscoe, 2017; Kaye, 2015). Programmatic advertising has itself grown in its capabilities to reach individuals, taking advantage of new sources of data to reach them on all of their devices (Regan, T., 2016). In 2016, for example, global ad giant WPP’s Xaxis system—“the world’s largest programmatic and technology platform”—launched “Xaxis Politics”. Capable of “reaching US voters across all digital channels”. the system is said to “segment audiences by hundreds of hot button issues as well as by party affiliation”, including via “real-time campaigns tied to specific real-world events” (Xaxis, 2015). Candidates were able to use the services of a growing list of companies, including Google, Rubicon, AOL, PubMatic, Appnexus and Criteo, that offered programmatic advertising platforms (“Political Campaigns”, 2016; Yatrakis, 2016).","Lookalike modelling","The use of big data analytics enables marketers to acquire information about an individual without directly observing behaviour or obtaining consent. They do this by “cloning” their “most valuable customers”in order to identify and target other prospective individuals for marketing purposes (LiveRamp, 2015). For example, Stirista (n.d.), a digital marketing firm that also serves the political world, offers lookalike modelling to identify people who are potential supporters and voters. The company claims it has matched 155 million voters to their “email addresses, online cookies, and social handles”, as well as “culture, religion, interests, political positions and hundreds of other data points to create rich, detailed voter profiles”. Facebook offers a range of lookalike modelling tools through its “Lookalike Audiences” ad platform. For example, Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign’s digital director, used the Lookalike Audiences ad tool to “expand” the number of people the campaign could target (Green & Issenberg, 2016). Facebook’s “Custom Audiences” product, similarly, enables marketers to upload their own data files so they can be matched and then targeted to Facebook users (Facebook, n.d.-e).","Geolocation targeting","Mobile devices continually send signals that enable advertisers (and others) to take advantage of an individual’s location—through the phone’s GPS (global positioning system), Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth communications. All of this can be done with increasing speed and efficiency. Through a host of new location-targeting technologies, consumers can now be identified and targeted wherever they go, while driving a car, pulling into a mall, or shopping in a store (Son, Kim, & Shmatikov, 2016). A complex and growing infrastructure of geolocation-based data-marketing services has emerged, with specialised mobile data firms, machine-learning technologies, measurement companies, and new technical standards to facilitate on-the-go targeting (Warrington, 2015). The use of mobile geo-targeting techniques played a central role in the 2016 election cycle, with a growing number of specialists offering their services to campaign operatives. For example, L2 (n.d.-a) made its voter file, along with HaystaqDNA modelling data, available for mobile device targeting, offering granular profile data on voters based on their interest in such contested topics as gun laws, gay marriage, voter fraud, and school choice, among others. Conde Nast’s Advance Publications’ election advertising worked with campaigns to append geo-location, profile data, and buying behaviour “to sculpt a very specific voter profile and target down to few hundred readers in a given geo location” (Ellwanger, 2016).","Online video advertising","Digital video, via mobile and other devices, is perceived as a highly effective way of delivering emotional content on behalf of brands and marketing campaigns (IAB, n.d.-a). There are a variety of online video ad formats that provide both short- and long-form content, and that work well for political and other marketing efforts. Progressive political campaign company Revolution Messaging, which worked for the Sanders campaign, developed what it calls “smart cookies” that it says take video and other ad placement “to the next level, delivering precision and accuracy” (Revolution Messaging, n.d.). Google’s YouTube has become a key platform for political ads, with the company claiming that today, voters make their political decisions not in “living rooms” in front of a television but in what it calls “micromoments” as people watch mobile video (DoubleClick, n.d.). According to the company’s political ad services research, mobile devices were used in nearly 60 percent of election-related searches during 2016. Content producers (which it calls “Creators”) on YouTube were able to seize on these election micro-moments to influence the political opinions of potential voters 18-49 (“Letter from the Guest Editors,” 2016).","Targeted TV advertising","Television advertising, which remains a linchpin of political campaign strategy, is undergoing a major transformation, as digital technologies and “addressable” set-top boxes have changed cable and broadcast TV into powerful micro-targeting machines capable of delivering the same kinds of granular, personalised advertising messages to individual voters that have become the hallmark of online marketing. Political campaigns are in the forefront of using set-top box “second-to-second viewing data”, amplified with other data sources, such as “demographic and cross-platform data from a multitude of sources” via information brokers, to deliver more precise ads (Fourthwall Media, n.d.; Leahey, 2016; NCC Media, n.d.). NCC Media, the US cable TV ad platform owned by Comcast, Cox, and Spectrum, provided campaigns the ability to target potential voters via the integration of its set-top box viewing information with voter and other data from Experian and others (Miller, 2017). Deals between TV data viewing companies and organisations representing both Republican- and Democratic-leaning groups brought the “targeting capabilities of online advertising to TV ad buys…bringing what was once accessible only to large state-wide or national campaigns to smaller, down-ballot candidates”, explained Advertising Age (Delgado, 2016).","Psychographic, neuromarketing, and emotion-based targeting","Psychographics, mood measurement, and emotional testing have been used by advertisers for many decades, and have also been a core strategy in political campaign advertising (Key, 1974; Packard, 2007; Schiller, 1975). The digital advertising industry has developed these tools even further, taking advantage of advances in neuroscience, cognitive computing, data analytics, behavioural tracking, and other recent developments (Crupi, 2015). Granular-based messages that trigger a range of emotional and subconscious responses, to better “engage” with individuals and deepen relationships with commercial brands, have become part of the DNA of digital advertising (McEleny, 2016). Facebook (2015), Nielsen, and most leading brands use “neuromarketing” services worldwide, which utilise neuroscience tools to determine the emotional impact of advertising messages. There is a growing field, recently promoted by Google, of “Emotion Analytics” that takes advantage of “new types of data and new tracking methods” to help advertisers “understand the impact of campaigns—and their individual assets—on an emotional level…” (Kelshaw, 2017). Scholars have identified that the use of “psychological targeting” in advertising enables the influencing of large groups of people by “tailoring persuasive appeals to the psychological needs” of the specific audiences (Matz, et al, 2017). Data company Experian Marketing Services for political campaigns offered data that weaved together “demographic, psychographic and attitudinal attributes” to target voters digitally. Experian claims its data enables campaigns to examine a target’s “heart and mind” via attributes related to their “political persona” as well as “attitudes, expectations, behaviours, lifestyles, purchase habits and media preferences (Experian, 2011, 2015). One of the most well publicised and controversial players in the 2016 election was Cambridge Analytica (CA), a prominent data analytics and behavioural communications firm that claimed to be a key component in Donald Trump’s victorious campaign. The company used a “five-factor personality model” aimed at determining “the personality of every single adult in the United States of America” (Albright, 2016; Kranish, 2016).Known as OCEAN, the model rated individuals based on five key traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Drawing from digital data, voter history, and marketing resources supplied by leading companies, including Acxiom, Experian, Nielsen, GOP firm Data Trust, Aristotle, L2, Infogroup, and Facebook, CA was able to develop an “internal database with thousands of data points per person”. Its research also identified key segments that were considered “persuadable”, and shaped the advertising content placed “across multiple digital channels (with the most effective ads also appearing on television) (Advertising Research Foundation, 2017; Nix, 2016). The strategy was based on developing messages that were tailored to the vulnerabilities of individual voters (Nix, 2016; Schwartz, 2017). CA has become the subject of much scrutiny and debate, and itself has made conflicting claims, with critics raising concerns over its techniques and expressing scepticism about the extent of its impact (Confessore & Hakim, 2017; Karpf, 2017). However, the company’s work was sufficiently convincing to the leading advertising industry research organisation, the Advertising Research Foundation (2017, March), that it honoured the firm with a “Gold” award in 2017 under its “Big Data” category.","Discussion","The above description provides only a brief overview of the data-driven marketing system that is already widely in use by candidate and issue campaigns in the United States. The increasingly central role of commercial digital marketing in contemporary political campaigns is reshaping modern-day politics in fundamental ways, altering relationships among candidates, parties, voters, and the media. We acknowledge that digital technologies have made important positive contributions to the vibrancy of the political sphere, including greatly expanding sources of news and information, significantly increasing opportunities for citizen participation, and empowering people from diverse backgrounds to form coalitions and influence policy. The same tools developed for digital marketing have also helped political campaigns substantially improve voter engagement, enhance their capacities for “small-donor” fundraising, and more efficiently generate turnout (Moonshadow Mobile, n.d.; Owen, 2017). However, many of the techniques we address in this paper raise serious concerns—over privacy, discrimination, manipulation, and lack of transparency.","Several recent controversies over the 2016 election have triggered greater public scrutiny over some of the practices that have become standard operating procedure in the digital media and marketing ecosystem. For example, “fake news” has a direct relationship to programmatic advertising, the automated system of “intelligent” buying and selling of individuals and groups (Weissbrot, 2016). These impersonal algorithmic machines are focused primarily on finding and targeting individual consumers wherever they are, often with little regard for the content where the ads may appear (Maheshwari & Isaac, 2016). As a consequence, in the middle of the 2016 election, many companies found themselves with ads placed on “sites featuring pornography, pirated content, fake news, videos supporting terrorists, or outlets whose traffic is artificially generated by computer programs”, noted the Wall Street Journal (Nicas, 2016; Vranica, 2017). As a major US publisher explained in the trade publication Advertising Age,","Programmatic’s golden promise was allowing advertisers to efficiently buy targeted, quality, ad placements at the best price, and publishers to sell available space to the highest bidders…. What was supposed to be a tech-driven quality guarantee became, in some instances, a “race to the bottom” to make as much money as possible across a complex daisy chain of partners. With billions of impressions bought and sold every month, it is impossible to keep track of where ads appear, so “fake news” sites proliferated. Shady publishers can put up new sites every day, so even if an exchange or bidding platform identifies one site as suspect, another can spring up (Clark, 2017).","Criticism from news organisations and civil society groups, along with a major backlash by leading global advertisers, led to several initiatives to place safeguards on these practices (McDermott, 2017; Minsker, 2017). For example, in an effort to ensure “brand safety”, leading global advertisers and trade associations demanded changes in how Google, Facebook and others conduct their data and advertising technology operations. As a consequence, new measures have been introduced to enable companies to more closely monitor and control where their ads are placed (Association of National Advertisers, 2017; Benes, 2017; IPA, 2017; Johnson, 2017; Liyakasa, 2017; Marshall, 2017; Timmers, 2015).","The Trump campaign relied heavily on Facebook’s digital marketing system to identify specific voters who were not supporters of Trump in the first place, and to target them with psychographic messaging designed to discourage them from voting (Green & Issenberg, 2016). Campaign operatives openly referred to such efforts as “voter suppression” aimed at three targeted groups: “idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans”. The operations used standard Facebook advertising tools, including “custom audiences” and so-called “dark posts”—“nonpublic paid posts shown only to the Facebook users that Trump chose” with personalised negative messages (Green & Issenberg, 2016). Such tactics also took advantage of commonplace digital practices that target individual consumers based on factors such as race, ethnicity, and socio-economic status (Google, 2017; Martinez, 2016; Nielsen, 2016). Civil rights groups have had some success in getting companies to change their practices. However, for the most part, the digital marketing industry has not been held sufficiently accountable for its use of race and ethnicity in data-marketing products, and there is a need for much broader, industry-wide policies.","Conclusion","Contemporary digital marketing practices have raised serious issues about consumer privacy over the years (Schwartz & Solove, 2011; Solove & Hartzog, 2014). When applied to the political arena, where political information about individuals is only one of thousands of highly sensitive data points collected and analysed by the modern machinery of data analytics and targeting, the risks are even greater. Yet, in the United States, very little has been done in terms of public policy to provide any significant protections. In contrast to the European Union, where privacy is encoded in law as a fundamental right, privacy regulation in the US is much weaker (Bennett, 1997; Solove & Hartzog, 2014; U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 2013). The US is one of the only developed countries without a general privacy law. As a consequence, except in specific areas, such as children’s privacy, consumers in the US enjoy no significant data protection in the commercial marketplace. In the political arena, there is even less protection for US citizens. As legal scholar Ira S. Rubinstein (2014) explains, “the collection, use and transfer of voter data face almost no regulation”. The First Amendment plays a crucial role in this regard, allowing the use of political data as a protected form of speech (Persily, 2016).","The political fallout over the how Russian operatives used Facebook, Twitter, and other sites in the 2016 presidential campaign has triggered unprecedented focus on the data and marketing operations of these and other powerful digital media companies. Lawmakers, civil society, and many in the press are calling for new laws and regulations to ensure transparency and accountability for online political ads (“McCain, Klobuchar & Warner Introduce Legislation”, 2017). The U.S. Federal Election Commission, which regulates political advertising, has asked for public comments on whether it should develop new disclosure rules for online ads (Glaser, 2017). In an effort to head-off regulation, both Facebook and Twitter have announced their own internal policy initiatives designed to provide the public with more information, including what organisations or individuals paid for political ads and who the intended targets were. These companies have also promised to establish archives for political advertising, which would be accessible to the public (Falck, 2017; Goldman, 2017; Koltun, 2017). The US online advertising industry trade association is urging Congress not to legislate in this area, but to allow the industry to develop new self-regulatory regimes in order to police itself (IAB, 2017). However, relying on self-regulation is not likely to address the problems raised by these practices and may, in fact, compound them. Industry self-regulatory guidelines are typically written in ways that do not challenge many of the prevailing (and problematic) business practices employed by their own members. Nor do they provide meaningful or effective accountability mechanisms (Center for Digital Democracy, 2013; Gellman & Dixon, 2011; Hoofnagle, 2005). It remains to be seen what the outcome of the current policy debate over digital politics will be, and whether any meaningful safeguards emerge from it.","While any regulation of political speech must meet the legal challenges posed by the First Amendment, limiting how the mining of commercial data can be used in the first place can serve as a critically important new electoral safeguard. Advocacy groups should call for consumer privacy legislation in the US that would place limits on what data can be gathered by the commercial online advertising industry, and how that information can be used. Americans currently have no way to decide for themselves (such as via an opt-in) whether data collected on their finances, health, geo-location, as well as race or ethnicity can be used for digital ad profiling. Certain online advertising practices, such as the use of psychographics and lookalike modelling, also call for rules to ensure they are used fairly.","Without effective interventions, the campaign strategies and practices we have documented in this paper will become increasingly sophisticated in coming elections, most likely with little oversight, transparency, or public accountability. The digital media and marketing industry will continue its research and development efforts, with an intense focus on harnessing the capabilities of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and cognitive computing, for advertising purposes. Advertising agencies are already applying some of these advances to the political field (Facebook, 2016; Google, n.d.-a; Havas Cognitive, n.d.). Academic scholars and civil society organisations will need to keep a close watch on all these developments, in order to understand fully how these digital practices operate as a system, and how they are influencing the political process. Only through effective public policies and enforceable best practices can we ensure that digital technology enhances democratic institutions, without undermining their fundamental goals.","Kreiss, D., & Mcgregor, S.C.

Kevin Quinlan was promoted from deputy to chief of staff in May while Magee remained on the payroll as Robertson’s special advisor to lobby Ottawa for housing and transit funds and to oppose the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion.","“It’s been a complete joy to serve Vancouver and work with such committed and selfless leaders,” wrote Magee, who was paid $144,547 in 2015. “The list of what we have achieved together for the city is long and globally recognized. I know the coming years will bring even more success based on this foundation. I’m proud of this and of the whole team.”","Magee founded Convergence almost 15 years ago and it was Vision Vancouver’s first headquarters when the party was formed after the 2003 COPE split.","“I’ll continue to advise the mayor and the team on critical issues and major projects as needed, particularly with opportunities for building partnerships with our new colleagues in the federal government,” Magee wrote. “And I’ll continue pursuing my passion for bringing people together and creating positive, tangible change in the world, working on national urban issues, business investments in the clean economy, and initiatives in other cities as well as some international projects that I’ve been wanting to pursue for a while.”","Convergence’s website is undergoing a redesign. A cached version said its services include strategic finance and philanthropy, campaign and communications planning, branding and focus groups. The website listed more that 50 clients, including Tides Canada and Renewal Partners, several American foundations, BC Hydro, EcoJustice, various First Nations groups and “several anonymous donors and investors.”","At his 2008 swearing-in, Robertson vowed: “I will not let you down on making city hall more open and accountable,” yet the Vision Vancouver city hall still has no lobbyist registry, was slammed for cosy relations with developers and found to have repeatedly broken freedom of information laws.","Magee admitted to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner in early 2015 that he mass-deletes his email. An OIPC investigation released last June found city hall delayed information inappropriately, deliberately missed deadlines, lost documentation, released incomplete responses and discriminated against reporters who sought public information.","A judge turned down a 2014-filed B.C. Supreme Court petition that alleged Robertson was in conflict of interest over the lease of a civic building to Hootsuite. But the case included evidence that Magee used his Convergence email account for communicating with Hootsuite CEO Ryan Holmes while the deal was under negotiation. The OIPC has said that public workers are not allowed to use private email accounts to subvert FOI laws.","With Magee at the helm, Vision raised a record $3.416 million for the 2014 re-election, including almost $2.26 million from corporations and $385,450 from unions.","Before the election, the party unsuccessfully lobbied the BC Liberal government to ban corporate and union donations, but Vision did not place any limits on its own fundraising. It did bow to pressure from opponents and media and released a preliminary list of donors during the campaign.","In 2015, Magee positioned Robertson as a supporter of Justin Trudeau’s victorious Liberal election campaign in the wake of Robertson’s failed leadership of the Yes campaign in the TransLink expansion plebiscite."],"isopubdate":"2017-12-19"}

The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said.","Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump's 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information.","Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action.","Cambridge Analytica, in turn, said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it.","Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. \"We must do better and will,\" he wrote on Twitter, adding that \"our business depends on it at every level\".","Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied.","Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, DC, said Facebook was relying on the goodwill of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse.","Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday. \"That's a long time,\" she said.","Britain's data protection authority and the Massachusetts attorney general on Saturday said they were launching investigations into the use of Facebook data.","\"It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\" UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's office said she wants to understand how the data was used, what policies if any were violated and what the legal implications are.","All rights reserved.

It might be a wake-up call. - The Washington Post","text":["Here’s how to download all your data from Facebook. It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information. According to Facebook, that download might also include the “unique number” Facebook assigns to you for facial recognition purposes, based on the photos you’ve been tagged in on the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

Not the good kind you see dancing in bikinis on Independence Day, the bad kind that strips freedom from citizens and grants it to donors,” Luckey wrote on a Reddit thread introducing his initiative, using the pseudonym NimbleRichMan.","Luckey’s support for Trump may be unusual in a tech industry that has a tendency to support Democrats, but it is his embrace of the dark side of Trump’s internet army that is so alarming. We may be used to the incredibly wealthy supporting pro-business politicians by writing checks to the Republican party, but the full-on embrace of “shitposting” and the bigoted online harassment that so often comes with it is something else entirely.","Shitposting is not intended to add to an online discussion but to shut it down with, well, shit. It is the opposite of the ideals of good faith, open discussion made possible by the internet.","Oculus Rift founder: 'Facebook as we know it is not the future of virtual reality'","Read more","Since the Daily Beast report, Luckey has received scrutiny by reporters seeking evidence of an affinity between the man who invented Oculus Rift and the candidate whose campaign has centered on attacks on immigrants and Muslims. Among the revelations is the fact that Luckey’s long-time girlfriend, Nicole Edelmann, is an apparent supporter of GamerGate, the anti-feminist online harassment movement that erupted in 2014.","Luckey, it seems, represents both sides of the increasingly schizophrenic tech industry: innovating tools for increased connection and knowledge with one hand, and empowering reactionary abuse and harassment with the other.","Luckey was just 18 when he built the first prototype for a virtual reality headset that would go on to raise almost $2.5m on Kickstarter and $75m from venture capital firms. He sold his company to Facebook for $2bn in 2014, when he was just 21 years old.","“If I grew up in ‘da hood’ it would make my story so much more interesting – if I had something to escape from,” he told the Telegraph in 2015. Instead, he grew up middle class in southern California, where he was homeschooled by his mother. A video game enthusiast who made money repairing iPhones, he dropped out of college and began tinkering with virtual reality headsets while working in a trailer parked in the driveway of his parents’ house.","Luckey’s public image – like his Time magazine cover – seems appealingly unpretentious. He wears sandals or goes barefoot at work, a detail repeated in most articles about him. He drives a 2001 Honda. He is really, really into video games.","He is not cool and doesn’t want to be.","As virtual reality and Oculus have risen in stature in the technology world, Luckey has made gestures toward the higher purpose we like our tech moguls to embrace – the narrative about changing the world for the better. Facebook has been “mak[ing] the world more open and connected”. Google has been “organiz[ing] the world’s information and mak[ing] it universally accessible and useful”.","Luckey has spoken about the potential value of virtual reality for education, and VR boosters tend to hype its potential to increase human empathy by expanding our ability to experience other people’s lives.","Still, at heart, Luckey doesn’t appear as invested in the transformative possibilities of his technology as we might hope. Asked by the Telegraph what aspect of VR he was most excited about, he responded: “Video games. I’m a shallow person.”","Video games don’t have to be shallow, and gamers don’t all agree with GamerGate, but Luckey’s involvement in the Trump meme machine suggests that his investment in the social good of technology is indeed shallow.","“I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time,” he told the Daily Beast about the shitposting organization.","“VR has the potential to make internet communication more heartfelt and real. But Palmer has decided to use his capital to support a fucking meme factory that delves online discussion into racist, angry, anti-intellectual bullshit.”"],"isopubdate":"2016-09-23"}

I’m against the immigration ban, and I support all women’s rights regardless of what political party they belong to. With that said, I do not support corporatism.","Since the early days of Greenpeace, to the Seattle WTO protests, to the Occupy movement one thing has been consistent: The people marched against corporatism, and globalism.","Yet since Donald Trump’s election, people have begun marching in the name of corporatism and globalism against a democratically elected President they’re accusing of being a fascist.","Protesting in the name of corporations, billionaires, and celebrities is corporatism.","Democrats and progressives should reject money from George Soros, and reject the propaganda and division manufactured by political operatives like David Brock. Just because they’re anti-Trump doesn’t mean they support you, or your rights.","I have no problem with people protesting Donald Trump, and expressing their freedom of speech as long as they do so peacefully and legally. However, I do have a problem when they do so with money from billionaires, political operatives, and corporations who do not have the American people’s best intentions in mind. Using the act of protest and identity politics for political, and corporate gain, is wrong.","I am seeing a disturbing trend happening in this country right now where activism, and the act of protest is being hijacked by the very organizations we the people of America should be protesting against.","Google Protests","Google was one of the largest lobbyists under the Obama administration, giving them incredible power and influence over policy which they just lost with Trump’s election. Their parent company Chairman and former CEO, Eric Schmidt, even secretly launched a startup to help Hillary Clinton win the election, and personally consulted with the Clinton campaign as revealed by Wikileaks. This confirmed many of the concerns of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in his piece: Google Is Not What It Seems.","Is it really a surprise they’re now allowing their employees to walk-out during work hours and essentially get paid to protest on the company’s behalf to support immigration policies that provide them with cheap labor?","David Brock","David Brock is a political operative and founder of Media Matters, a left-wing think tank. He also founded the now infamous Correct The Record, which was a highly organized left-wing propaganda organization used to try and elect Hillary Clinton by essentially trolling the Internet (I wish I was joking). Well, he just announced a $40 million PAC called American Bridge to continue to propagandize the American people against Donald Trump.","Sorry r/conspiracy and r/the_donald, it looks like you’ll be fighting off David Brock shills and trolls for at least the next 4-years.","Protesting A False Reality","The Wikipedia page for the Women’s March tells a wonderful story about a woman in Hawaii who merged her Facebook page with a group in New York and magically organized over 4.8 million people across the country in multiple cities with no resources or experience organizing major events. What Wikipedia left out is the marches were paid for and hijacked by billionaire George Soros who had supposedly planned to organize Hillary Clinton victory marches after the inauguration, and simply switched his funding to the Women’s March after Trump was elected.","What this means is the largest protest in US history was financed by the financial supporters of a single political party, whose candidate just lost an election, which essentially undermined any claim these protests were inclusive of Trump supporters. The truth is the majority of white women actually voted for Donald Trump, and many of them did not feel included by the political rhetoric present at the Women’s March. Arguably, this was a left-leaning anti-Trump protest masquerading as a women’s rights protest. I say this not because I believe the people who attended the protests had that intention, but because the people who funded the march absolutely did.","While I personally support women’s rights, and I am opposed to the immigration ban, you won’t catch me marching in the name of an insane billionaire, corporation (I’m looking at you Google), political operatives, or celebrities. By participating in protests organized and funded by special interests you are marching and protesting under the banners of corporatism and globalism. These billionaires, companies, and celebrities each have their own intentions, and motivations which often do not have the American people’s best interests in mind. In the case of many celebrities, they are simply unaware of the influence and power of these political operatives and ignorantly contribute to their causes to further acquire fame, and favor with the political establishment.","So the next time you plan to protest, ask yourself: Who’s funding this protest?","Perhaps instead of following the herd, you should create your own local grassroots movement to support your values and openly reject money from billionaires and corporate overlords. The point of protesting is to create change, and to make connections with like minded people, it isn’t about serving the desires of elitist billionaires, especially if they’re your boss."],"isopubdate":"2017-01-31"}

Though the social network’s “contact import” feature has been around for a very, very long time, you’ve probably forgotten about it. And if you want keep Facebook from filling in the gaps by collecting data about your friends from you—or worse, records of your call data—it’s easy to shut your devices up.","What have you already told Facebook?","Screenshot: David Murphy","Advertisement","To get a look at the contacts you’ve already uploaded to Facebook, you’ll want to visit Facebook’s Manage Invites and Imported Contacts page. You might be slightly shocked to see open invites from many, many years ago still active—just a little head-nod to the viral aspects of the social network back when it was still getting off the ground (and more of a collegiate gathering ground than anything else). Feel free to delete these; who needs an invite to Facebook nowadays anyway?","The lower section on the page shows you all the contacts that Facebook has imported from you—which sounds ominous, but it’s a practice you likely gave the service permission to do at some point in your Facebook history. One hopes.","Screenshot: David Murphy","Advertisement","You can go through these contacts name by name if you really want, but it’s probably better to just delete them all in one big swoop. Click on the “Remove all contacts” link, confirm the deletion by hitting “Remove,” and take a small moment to yourself while Facebook purges this data—again, one hopes.","Screenshot: David Murphy","While your mass-deletion will make Facebook’s “friend suggestion” tool less useful, that’s a small price to pay for helping your friends out by not sharing information about them that they have chosen not to share with Facebook themselves. Finding friends on Facebook is easy; becoming a good data steward is a little trickier, but totally achievable.","Advertisement","Screenshot: David Murphy","You can also perform the same trick for contacts you’ve uploaded via Facebook’s Messenger app. Just click on this link to see your data dump.","As before, you can delete all the contacts, which will make Facebook’s friend recommendations less useful and also help keep the social giant from learning more about your friends than they wanted it to know—at least, from you.","Advertisement","Don’t automatically re-upload your contacts","One little quirk about Facebook is that if you’ve already turned on the setting that allows your device to automatically import your friends’ contact information to Facebook, deleting this information won’t do any good—it’ll just re-sync the next time you use the app. Let’s fix that.","Advertisement","Within the Facebook app, tap on the hamburger icon. On Android, you’ll be looking for the App Settings option. On iOS, you’ll have to tap on Settings toward the bottom of the screen, then Account Settings, then General.","Screenshot: David Murphy","In either version of the app, you’ll then look for an option about Uploading Contacts—likely with the subheader “Automatically upload new and updated contacts.” Tap that, and flip it off to prevent Facebook from automatically repopulating the contacts you just deleted.","Advertisement","And because Facebook makes this process as easy as possible, you’ll also have to to pull up the separate Messenger app and toggle a similar switch there. Once you’re in Messenger, tap on your profile picture in the upper-left corner of the app. Look for the People option on the ”Me” screen, tap it, and then de-select the option to “Sync Contacts.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Free labor is Facebook's lifeblood","By Casey WilliamsMar 26, 2018","Chances are, you work for Facebook.","You probably don't have an office or an ID card. And you almost certainly don't get paid. But if you're one of the 239 million Americans who use the platform each month, your work is as valuable as a coder's. Maybe more. Your clicks, likes, and posts keep content circulating, users scrolling, and data streaming into algorithms used to serve you ads. Leave, and the platform crumbles.","You do two jobs for Facebook. You generate data and produce content. Facebook is essentially an advertising company, and every bit of information you disclose is data advertisers can use to influence how and what you buy. Sometimes it's fairly benign (maybe you do want that Blue Apron subscription). Other times it's not. Data is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to shape your behavior, and as Cambridge Analytica shows, it can be dangerous.","Your job is to drive people to the platform and keep them there","You also create most of what's on Facebook. You write posts, share photos, and capture live video of speeches, protests, and police shootings. The time and effort you sink into crafting a poetic confession, an impassioned rant, a thoughtful reflection on the day's news — think of it as work you do for Facebook. You're working to keep the site humming and vibrant, and you're creating reasons for others to keep scrolling. Your job is to drive people to the platform and keep them there.","And you spend a lot of time doing it. In 2016, users spent an average of 50 minutes a day using Facebook products, including Instagram and Messenger. That number has declined recently, but let's say you spend, say, 35 minutes a day on the site. That's 26 eight-hour days a year — \"more than any other leisure activity surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the exception of watching television programs and movies,\" according to the New York Times. \"It's more time than people spend reading (19 minutes); participating in sports or exercise (17 minutes); or social events (four minutes).\"","Time Well Spent?","Leisure is labor on Facebook. People use the app voluntarily, and yet, as more and more social activities relocate to the internet, it's increasingly work people feel they have to do to live meaningful, connected lives. Facebook is a News Feed, photo album, personal archive, community forum, and more. Think, for a second, about deleting Facebook. What will happen to your photos? Where will you get your news? Will anyone remember your birthday?","Like all social media companies, Facebook makes money from the basic labors of life: our need to maintain friendships and family ties, keep up with news, form and share beliefs about the world. \"What appears, at first glance, to be a free activity of communication,\" researchers at the University Lüneburg and University of Essex wrote in a recent paper, \"is in fact a form of 'free labor.'\"","It's valuable labor, too. The company earned nearly $16 billion in profit in 2017, according to its annual earnings report. Most of that was from ad revenue, which jumped nearly 50 percent.","Free labor has always made the U.S. economy hum. Slavery got the country on its feet, and unpaid house work — cooking, cleaning and child care, still done mostly by women — has for over two centuries made it possible for people to wake up every morning and go to work. The effort we put into caring for others is labor, and women still do most of that, too. While employers mostly benefit from this unpaid work indirectly, social media companies go right to the source. They extract value directly from the work we do to stay connected to the world.","This kind of extraction isn't unique to Facebook, or even to social media. The idea of a \"prosumer\" — a consumer who also produces — dates back to the 1980s. Sites like Yelp rely on users to generate reviews; Spotify asks listeners to fill in missing album data; Medium makes money from amateur writers looking to publish.

Edwards said the company claimed it wasn't bound by New Zealand's privacy laws and didn't have to comply with a request from his office to take a look at the disputed information.","Facebook said Edwards had made a \"broad and intrusive\" request for private data, and that the company was protecting its users.","\"We are disappointed that the New Zealand privacy commissioner asked us to provide access to a year's worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticized us for protecting their privacy,\" the company said in a statement.","The commissioner's finding allows the man to seek financial damages against Facebook.

Edwards said Facebook should comply by New Zealand laws but the company was arguing it's not bound by them because its operation is based in Ireland.","Edwards said Facebook has 2.5 million users in New Zealand, about half of the nation's population, and that it takes money from New Zealand businesses.","\"We don't believe there's any credible question that it's operating in New Zealand and is subject to New Zealand laws,\" he said.","Facebook didn't address the jurisdictional question in its statement.","The company said it had investigated the man's complaint but hadn't got enough detail to resolve it.

{"originalurl":"https://thebea.st/2pJCZ7i?source=facebook&via=desktop","title":"Trump Does Trump, and Things Get Worse","text":["Mandel Ngan/Getty","Amidst the numbing chaos that is the Trump administration, these past few days are worth reflecting on because three events have moved the needle in a bad direction.","1. The hiring of John Bolton highlights Donald Trump’s instability, his total lack of any coherent worldview, and most of all—and most dangerously of all—his need to feel that no limits are being imposed on him. Here’s what I mean. When talking foreign policy, sometimes Trump sounds like Bolton, with all that overheated rhetoric he’s thrown at Kim Jong Un. But at other times, he’s an isolationist. At still other times, like when he’s agreeing to meet with Kim with no preconditions, he’s a Neville Chamberlain in the making. (By the way, is Lloyd’s of London taking odds yet on whether that summit will actually happen?)","So if he wasn’t happy with H.R. McMaster and wanted new blood, he could have gone in any number of ways. That he chose the guy who will reinforce his worst instincts tells us, I think, that what he values most (aside from unquestioning loyalty) is someone who won’t hem him in; in other words, Trump may decide to launch a first strike against North Korea, or he may not. But if he does, by God, he doesn’t want some globalist ninny telling him not to. So the principle at work here is not hawkishness per se. It’s having someone who won’t tell him no.","Remember how Fred Flintstone, when he was thinking of stealing the vacation money to buy a new bowling ball, would have a little angel and little devil pop up on each shoulder making their respective cases? Bolton is Trump’s little devil, and clearly, Trump wanted things that way.","2. Trump’s slapstick handling of the budget shows us—again, but probably more than anything before it—just how massively in over his head he is in the job. As Michael Grunwald wrote in Politico last week, Trump just got rolled by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. They didn’t get their Dreamers request, but they got everything else, and Trump got very little. Thirty-three miles of border fence but no sanctuary cities defunding, no Planned Parenthood defunding, and not much else.","Yes, it was congressional Republicans who cut these deals, not Trump. But Trump couldn’t cut them, or credibly refute cutting them, because he doesn’t know enough to do one or the other. He knows nothing about the ins and outs of the budget. And that ridiculous feint last Friday morning that he was going to veto it… He relented after a few people with some actual knowledge told him how suicidal that would be, let alone on his way out to another weekend at Mar a Lago. But it was embarrassing.","3. The Stormy Daniels story was kind of non-newsy on certain levels. That Trump slept with a porn star and behaved crudely toward her is about the least shocking thing in the world. But the threats made against her are the real story here. That’s going to be the new iteration of this story, and depending on how it plays out it stands the chance of reminding the country of something that many have forgotten, or never knew: The president of the United States has mob ties.","Here’s David Cay Johnston cataloguing a few of them, like how Trump went out of his way to use Mafia-controlled companies to pour the concrete for Trump Tower. The great Wayne Barrett was the master chronicler of all this, going back to the 1990s. All you need to know for now is that back in the day, the government of Australia denied him a permit to open a casino in Sydney because the government deemed him to be too mobbed up. Trump will say of this failure that he lost interest in Australia, but Australia also lost interest in him.","We’re bound to see some more reporting about the nature of these threats that Daniels discussed on 60 Minutes Sunday night. What else do Daniels and that swashbuckling lawyer of hers have with regard to these threats? Is Robert Mueller maybe looking into who made them on Trump’s behalf? Is Mueller going to interview Michael Cohen one of these days? That might be Mueller’s best path to Trump. Depending on where this goes, Americans could learn some interesting things about the past associations of the man who now embodies our democratic republic.","And now we hear that Trump may want to be his own chief of staff. Hey, why not? A president needs a chief of staff only when he relies on staff. When he does things like read, and look at evidence. Trump doesn’t need anyone. He has his TV. If they don’t say it on Fox & Friends, how important can it be, anyway?","As we think back over these 14 months, we recall that the madness started literally on the first day, with the speech about “carnage” and the protests about his crowd size. And every week has brought jaw-dropping moments, too many to count.","But this is different. Trump has spent a year-plus feeling that he was heeding the advice of these wise people in Washington (he wasn’t really, but in his mind he was), and it hasn’t made him happy. Now he’s finished with that.","It’s one thing to run a privately held company on the fly, trusting the same “gut” that drove you into multiple bankruptcies. But to make the fate of the country, its people, and—in the case of North Korea and possibly Iran—its volunteer soldiers, hinge on your uninformed gut is criminal. I mean that figuratively, for now. But Mueller may make it literal.","Shocking as these last few days have been, there is still worse yet to come."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The initial wave of this scandal began last week when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy, had acquired information on more than 50 million Facebook users via an app that accessed that information through the Facebook platform several years ago.","Last week, Zuckerberg said in one of several interviews that, “if it ever the case that I am the most informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify, I will happily do that.” Clearly, it appears that Congress wants the chief executive officer of the formerly-$500 billion advertising-driven business to be the one to do the explaining amid the increased fallout over the Cambridge Analytica debacle.","While Facebook is not unfamiliar with privacy snafus, this appeared to be one of the final straws, forcing Facebook CEO to issue a sort of non-apology-ish apology — as well as take out full page (in wildly not-very-engaging full text form, weirdly enough) ads in several major newspapers. Zuckerberg in particular has been a face absent in front of Congress, but it appears the pressure from this incident may be too much for the company to handle without getting his face out there in order to neutralize the fallout.","Facebook offered CTO Mike Schroepfer and chief product officer Chris Cox to meet with the UK committee this morning, but Zuckerberg again was absent there. Indeed, it was several days following the Cambridge Analytica reports that Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg made a formal statement in the form of Facebook posts, as well as a number of interviews with various media outlets to try to explain themselves out of the situation.","We reached out to Facebook for a comment and will update the post when we hear back."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}
{"originalurl":"https://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2017/05/09/the-evolution-of-democracy/","title":"The evolution of democracy | Heather Marsh","text":["Rethinking the moats and mountains","Menu","The evolution of democracy","Transcript (more or less) from The evolution of democracy: Explaining Trump, Brexit and the Colombia peace deal, a keynote at Inteligencia Colectiva para la Democracia’ in Madrid, November, 2016.","My name is Heather Marsh. I am a writer and a programmer and I have been studying and experimenting with both local activism and methods of mass communication and collaboration for many years now. From 2010 to 2012 I was the administrator and editor in chief of the Wikileaks news site Wikileaks Central where I experimented with creating knowledge repositories, tying that information to things that were happening in the news and creating action based on that information. News without action is just voyeurism and action without information creates a very easily manipulated public, so I was trying to bring the two together in one place. In 2012 I concentrated more social media collaboration and I wrote a first book called Binding Chaos about all the problems I had seen while working with Wikileaks, Occupy, Anonymous, M15 and many other mass movements in recent years. We all seemed to be coming up against the same issues with hierarchy, direct democracy, consensus and collaboration. As I kept working on various projects it became apparent that we as societies had been butting heads for millenia on these same issues which really come down to trying to create a balance between autonomy, diversity and society, which is the title of my next book. And along the way I have been thinking of what tools we would require to help us achieve this balance, and the primary one I have been working on is a universal database and trust network called Getgee.","So today what I would like to talk about are some ideas from Binding Chaos and a little bit from Autonomy, Diversity, Society which will hopefully help when we are thinking about creating products for mass communication and mass collaboration. The focus is on creating a balance between personal autonomy of those doing the work, diversity of ideas and solutions and allowing the participation of the whole society.","How many people here have heard of a technological singularity? A technological singularity is something IT people and science fiction writers have liked to talk about for years. The idea is that we will reach a point, or have already reached a point, where technology is beyond the scope of human understanding and artificial intelligence will be programming itself, in a Skynet sort of world. It’s funny, people have been talking about this for years, but not many have noticed or acknowledged that we have instead reached a completely different type of singularity which is a societal singularity. We have reached a point where no one can understand every aspect of society which affects them. If you go back in history, crafts people could know everything there is to know about their jobs and people could know everything that went on in their villages but this is just not true any more. And even our villages and neighbourhoods are not autonomous, they are all connected now at some level with all the other communities in the whole world, even uncontacted tribes.","We need to collaborate with others not only to develop tools but even just to understand the news. We have to put our faith in other people and believe in what they tell us or trust in their skill to create their components if we are building a product. As programmers we have been used to working as an ecosystem like this for years, we always have to incorporate other people’s work and their bugs into our own, but this has spread to almost every aspect of public life. And this is one of the biggest challenges in creating tools for democracy. We can’t have real direct democracy or self governance any more because none of us can understand every aspect of everything. We need to rely on collaboration instead and this is going to require a completely different set of rules than we have used in the past. We need more than simple referendums and voting to govern ourselves this way. We need to somehow create nuanced and detailed information we can trust and we need to coordinate goals with people we will never speak to.","There are two main areas to talk about which are idea based collaboration and action based collaboration. The challenge in a societal singularity is how to allow all people to participate and communicate but still be able to filter signal from noise and how to allow people democratic choice but still retain worker autonomy.","First of all, let’s look at mass action based collaboration.","For action based tasks, the model that has become almost ubiquitous is the competitive hierarchical model. Most of us are all too familiar with this model. The typical response to a situation which requires an action is to create a noun, in the form of an organization, government body, or an official person and the focus is always on the organization and the personalities involved instead of the action. The hierarchy creates what I call personality based systems, as opposed to idea or action based systems. A new idea in a personality based system remains completely bound to the owner until it is legally transferred to another owner. All contributors work for the owner, not the idea, and you have to wait on one specific person for approval or direction at each level so there are bottle necks everywhere.","Most workers do not enjoy hierarchical systems as they lose autonomy, mastery and creative control over their own work, they just become an instrument under somebody else’s direction. The orders come from the top down and so there is very little diversity of ideas and we lose all the talent and ideas downstream. Because it is a closed system, collaboration between people does not happen unless they are hired by the same project. Competition is the opposite of mass collaboration. It’s really people working against each other, not together. So there is no autonomy, no diversity and no society.","The alternative to competition has traditionally been cooperation. Cooperative groups try to replace the top down hierarchy with a group consensus driven system which allows diversity of opinion at the top.","This is most effective only in groups of two to eight people. For groups larger than 25, cooperation is extremely slow. It is still a personality based system. An idea in a cooperative must be approved by the entire group, both on initiation and at each stage of development. The majority of energy and resources are spent on communication, persuasion, and personality management, and a power struggle can derail the whole project.","It can be dominated by extroverted personalities who make decisions to control the work of others and are very justly resented by those doing the actual work. Cooperatives frequently use consensus or votes to make decisions for the entire group. These methods may not produce the best results, particularly in large groups, as many people may not understand the work if they are not actually doing it and they may demand things they would never be willing to do themselves. The feeling of the workers at the bottom is no different whether there is a horizontal or a hierarchical structure making the decisions, the workers still have no personal autonomy.","Both competitive and cooperative projects will die if the group that runs the project leaves and both will attract or repel contributors based on the personalities of the existing group. Both are hierarchical systems where individuals need to seek permission to contribute. Both focus on the authority of personalities to approve a decision instead of focusing on the idea or action itself. So we have a society, at least within the group, but not without, but we still have no autonomy and because of the need to reach consensus there is also no diversity of product.","This isn’t in any way to say that cooperative and consensus driven systems are bad. They are actually the most comfortable way of working in small groups who know each other and have similar styles and share a goal, but they are very difficult to scale. As soon as you have a very large group of people with opposing viewpoints and personalities that don’t mesh, it is very difficult to get anything done.","I use stigmergy to describe a method of action based collaboration that is suitable for mass movements. I didn’t make up this awful word by the way, it is lifted from biology where it describes indirect communication and collaboration among ants and termites and various other creatures. In human movements, it allows diversity of methods and autonomy for workers while still putting the ultimate authority of choice with the whole society, to try to achieve that balance we talked of earlier. It is neither competitive nor cooperative. It is action based collaboration instead of personality based.","A system is stigmergic if","– it follows one goal","– it is completely transparent","– it is open to everyone to participate, at least within the user group","– the output is free for anyone to use and improve on","Stigmergy gives people autonomy over their own work. With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or group of personalities. So no one needs permission, like they would in a competitive system, or consensus like they would in a cooperative, to initiate a project. There is no need to discuss or vote on the idea. If an idea is exciting or necessary it will attract interest and the interest attracted will be from people willing to contribute so those with more involvement in the idea will automatically have greater influence through their contributions.","There are no official authorities but the power of the user group still exists in the ability to accept or reject the work.","Workers are free to create regardless of acceptance or rejection. Drastically innovative ideas almost never receive instant mainstream acceptance so leaving control of work to group consensus only cripples innovation. When we allow anyone to contribute we also have a great diversity of talent and people can step up to further the goal in ways the originator never imagined.","So here we have full autonomy and diversity but the entire society still has the ultimate choice.","Where is stigmergy? We have always had stigmergy in our social lives and it has been behind most mass movements that have had any success. You can see it wherever groups of diverse people who do not belong to any formal organization or have any formal communication with each other are all working together to carry out a goal.","If you look at something like the civil rights movement in the United States, that is a multi-generational movement of so many people and so many different methods and everyone who has contributed, whether they are groups or individuals, has decided for themselves how they can be most effective. If this stigmergy chart was for that movement, that big group can be the Million Man March, the square is Malcolm X and his followers, the heart can be MLK, and between them all by themselves is Ruby Bridges or Rosa Parks, none of them had to communicate or come to consensus but they are all trying for the same goal and are more or less aware of each other’s activity. The US still hasn’t reached that goal so they go through periods of great upheaval followed by periods of more calm working, depending on whether an event sparks more action or something blocks progress for a while.","A stigmergic movement will continue as long as the goal is not reached and people still share it, even if it dies down or goes dormant for a bit. That is the advantage to an idea based system over a personality based one, you can’t kill an idea.","Or another stigmergic idea is freedom of information. This has everyone from the free software movement, creative commons and similar open copyright groups, Sci-Hub which liberates scientific papers, other filesharing sites, Wikipedia, even the Internet itself in its original inception might be considered a node in that stigmergic movement.","What keeps these movements from burning out, like so many do in the massive assemblies, is the fact that they are not spending all their energy communicating except in small groups and they are following one clear idea.","It is not often you find one organization or group that is purely stigmergic, but Anonymous is one. This is why they say they are not an organization or group. They usually say they are an idea, but they aren’t really one idea either, they are a method of mass collaboration and the method is stigmergy. That method allows everyone to follow whatever ideas they choose, in groups or individually with perfect autonomy. Anonymous never tries to reach consensus. Anonymous is not unanimous. And there is no organization you can order to do something, Anonymous is also not your personal army. You have to just put an idea out and see who follows it.","It may seem difficult to figure out how stigmergy can be used in a corporate setting where everything is set up around organizations and official people, but it helps if we remember that each of those organizations, no matter how they are organized internally, can be a node under a stigmergic idea. I am often asked if Wikipedia is a good example of stigmergy and no, it is not. Wikipedia is a cooperative. You may contribute work without asking anyone but your work can be thrown out and you can be locked out of contributing, or the topic locked, and there is a definite personality based hierarchy and a need to reach consensus around one final product. There is no diversity of product tolerated and there isn’t any real autonomy either.","But Wikipedia is still one of many nodes under the idea of Freedom of information because what they produce is completely free for anyone else to use or modify. I said earlier that Anonymous was stigmergic but Anonymous very frequently works with other people like news or human rights organizations or other hacking collectives such as Redhack who are themselves internally communist. It doesn’t matter what the internal organization of each node is as long as they are all following the same idea and their work is available for everyone else to use.","So the same methods can be used for corporate work. The key is for corporate style organizations to recognize what stigmergic ecosystem they are a part of and follow the guidelines to make their work contribute smoothly to that idea. One place where stigmergic development has really taken off is in the IT industry because free software has meant that the output is available for everyone to use and improve or modify. If we look at one stigmergic idea: We need better web development tools. If we had left this to Google, and Google had been acting like their competitive corporate selves, we would have just had the Angular framework, and progress would be Angular 2.0. And we do have Angular 2.0, but we also have Facebook’s React, Ember and many others. As long as the user group has not reached consensus over what tools we want for full stack development we have many contributors creating different frameworks for us.","When we start to reach wide consensus in some area, like yes, we don’t want any more black and purple websites with green sparkles and the vast majority of us are going to create websites that are very uniform, we start to see more and more conformity around standards like Twitter’s bootstrap styles but as soon as someone has a very divergent idea that people find interesting again, like Google’s material design, many people will start hacking on it and trying to create different solutions again. The same periodic upheavals of innovation and change are apparent here as in the social movements driven by stigmergy. In this case HTML5 and ES6 stimulated a rush in web development tools in general.","Of course this example of corporate stigmergy has some major issues., first in who is getting paid and who is not. Google employees are and free software programmers frequently are not. And even with free software, when you have players like Facebook and Google and Twitter it is going to be a bit hard for anyone without their development team budget and user groups to compete so it is not a level playing field for all to participate, but as long as the code is commons property we can have consensus without monopoly which is a huge improvement. It is starting to approach stigmergic organization, just from the addition of this one change, of software that is free for anyone to use or modify. You can see this especially as you move away from the big corporations to the later development add ons, in all the diverse people writing packages and tools for React and Angular and the other frameworks.","This is better than academia and science manage. They are supposed to be stigmergic as well, the idea in science and academia is that everyone is supposed to publish and build off each others findings, but because they do not have open source and permissive copyright or even access, their work is frequently corporate IP property, and they don’t allow or reward outside contributions, they are very far from stigmergic and their progress is not nearly what it could be. If we look back at the principles of stigmergic organization, the last three of four points do not apply to science and academia so they both need to change if they are going to truly act as epistemic communities for us all. Which brings us to my next point which is about idea based collaboration.","We have stigmergy for action based collaboration which follows an idea, but what if we want to collaborate on ideas themselves, to build knowledge and find some most reliable facts? If we look at the 2010-2011 movements, like M15 and later Occupy and all the rest, they were fine with action based collaboration, especially when they used stigmergy, but they really struggled when it came to idea based collaboration, like setting goals. This is kind of important since without the ideas, you don’t have the action. Stigmergy follows ideas and information, so management of the ideas and information here is as important as management of personalities is in competitive or cooperative systems. If you think of this in a governance context, we won’t be electing personalities, we will be electing ideas.","To see what happens when an idea loses its clarity, or its idea has been co-opted, look at feminism. The civil rights movement in the US retained its clarity because it has set specific goals in each cycle whether that is to end slavery, end segregation, or end police violence. When feminism meant fighting for the vote and legal personhood it had a clear goal and was a stigmergic mass movement but second wave feminism allowed itself to become a noun instead of an action, its goals became very loose and because there wasn’t a clear goal it was used to advertise corporate product and promote prominent personalities, primarily from the United States, who felt they could speak for every woman in the world on every topic. A noun is not a stigmergic goal, a noun is an organization, so when feminism became a noun it stopped being a stigmergic movement and became a competitive, personality driven, organization which became completely divided, as is typical, these types of organizations do not scale.","The single biggest factor I’ve found for whether or not someone will participate in a stigmergic action is whether they are sure of the idea behind it. Not whether it affects them, or if its simple to grasp or easy or even safe to do. I have created many actions where the audience was completely removed from the people affected or where the action was dangerous or very difficult to understand or even initially believe. None of this mattered. All that mattered in whether the action was a success was whether people could be sure the goal is sound. And the easiest way for someone to prevent action is to sow doubt in the goal. That initial kernel that makes up the idea looks simple but it is everything. But finding the information we need for conviction in our goals is not easy.","If we think of a large population creating a knowledge repository stigmergicly, we have a picture of a bunch of ants sifting and sorting information and putting the best in a pile. And that’s probably how we thought we were going too do things on Twitter. But that’s not how expert knowledge, like the kind we have in a singularity, works and it’s why a bunch of people in a horizontal group can’t just do that. Especially a personality dominated horizontal group like Occupy or any direct democracy that starts from the premise of all voices and opinions being equal. This goes back to the idea behind a societal singularity, we can’t all be experts at everything and we don’t want to be either. We don’t have the time and we may not have the interest. We can’t keep berating voters for not spending all of their time studying everything that affects them, it’s impossible and it’s not fun either. We need to find a better solution.","I love this chart because it illustrates exactly why we need concentric circles in a democracy. This space between innovation and acceptance is where demagogues and gate keepers lie in wait to control information before it reaches the public. Like little trolls under the bridge. This is why we need knowledge bridges to replace the gatekeepers because most ideas can’t make it across this chasm on their own.","If you think of recent examples of elite working groups whose ideas were rejected by the wider society, like Brexit in the UK or the peace deal in Colombia, it was because of a failure of the working group to establish effective knowledge bridges between them and the public. The public did not see their viewpoints being heard and responded to and they did not see or understand or trust the decision making process, which gave demagogues on the outside of the process the ability to derail the acceptance of their recommendations. The people had information that was too difficult to audit themselves, and they had no faith in the people offering solutions. People in the UK said repeatedly they were sick of being lied to by the media and experts.","When people lose faith in those who are supposed to be their experts, like politicians, or those who are supposed to be their knowledge bridges like the media, they lose faith in any stigmergic goal these people present and they will block it, as I said earlier. The information from the opposition in both cases was certainly no better, nobody was offering a fully developed and audited plan for an alternative peace deal or a detailed plan to exit the EU, but even very poorly supported information and hyperbole is sufficient to overturn an idea that the public doesn’t trust. We can see this also in most elections, there are just demagogues and hyperbole on both sides, there is no process of reconciling any issues with the public or providing information people can rely on. In fact, the goal seems to be to deliberately confuse and immobilize the public and then just give them a binary vote in the hope they vote against the establishment which has lost so much trust. This is why both sides seem to only be interested in painting the other as the most corrupt establishment.","[On May 8 2017, former US Director of National intelligence James Clapper suggested the solution to the misinformation of the US 2016 election was to further fund USAID and spread more misinformation against US enemies. Those are exactly the actions that caused people to lose faith in information emanating from the US in the first place.]","You may have seen a lot of people blaming this current state of low information on social media and they are partially right but corporate media certainly doesn’t get a free pass either. Most of the tools we have to communicate simulate direct democracy and look for popular ideas, the most retweets and the most readers, but not only is popular not innovative or expert, the two are mutually exclusive. Popular ideas are riding the peak of the wave of socially acceptable opinion. They already appeal to the widest audience. They are not new ideas, by definition, and they aren’t at a level of elite expertise that is difficult for all but a few to understand also by definition. This is why we now elect politicians on the basis of their tweets and this is the secret for politicians like Donald Trump who speaks at a grade 3 level. The more easily understood and the less challenging your message, the wider your appeal will be so an age that amplifies the most popular information, as we do now, will be an age of demagogues.","It is counter intuitive to think popular ideas are what we need to give us the best information. If we need some specialized level of knowledge to explain something like Brexit or a peace deal or the issues in an election, or if we want those making the decisions to hear the voices that are seldom heard, that may expand their Overton windows and give us some fresh perspective, or represent a rare case that will cause their solution to break, amplifying the most popular ideas or people is the exact opposite of what we ought to be doing. And really this is what direct democracy, representative and liquid democracy do, so of course it is also what the tools for democracy have been doing.","We have tools that are very useful to find out what a population thinks and tools that are great for discussing things and coming to consensus, but we need to also go to where their opinions are formed. Opinions are based on information. We need to be able to find expertise and accurate and diverse information that we can trust before we form our opinions and long before we measure them.","Ideas need to be audited and promoted by those users qualified to understand them to allow diversity of ideas and prevent the process from being dominated by celebrities without the expertise required. But if we have an elite discussion group with only elite experts or ideas in it, we are at great risk of having an elite oligarchy based on control of information. This is what we have now. We don’t maintain the necessary balance between autonomy, diversity and society unless this quiet place to talk remains a fully associated part of the wider group. So to avoid a hierarchy and leave control with the entire user group, I use a structure I call concentric circles.","Concentric circles relate to sound amplification. In a concentric circle, people or ideas promoted to the center by their peer group receive greatest amplification and their findings will be audited, amplified and explained to the general public by outer circles. They are not hierarchical as they have no direct control over the actions of anyone. An epistemic community is a knowledge resource only, authority remains with the entire user group which provides a good incentive for the epistemic community to ensure transparency and knowledge bridges so their ideas are accepted. As in stigmergy, votes in a concentric group are frequently replaced by actions. If this little drop receives no amplification, it is just an idea that goes nowhere.","With knowledge bridges, you don’t have to have personal expertise on every aspect of society. All you have to do is have a transparent concentric circle that you can look at, you can see the activity, you can get feedback if necessary, and you can say yes, there are a lot of people auditing, there is a lot of discussion, I trust some of the people in these circles, I trust that they know what they are doing. Everyone can review the work of the experts both directly and through the review by their peers. Experts can also be created by the system itself as users develop knowledge and reputation and move towards the centre and you will find this happens increasingly if users lose trust, they will realize they need to start auditing this circle.","Communication should not be the full responsibility of the experts in the centre, which is where government initiatives like Brexit and the Colombia peace deal have failed. Ideas should be carried over expertise bridges by full transparency and user participation. The epistemic community in the centre should not need to protect themselves from demands or attacks from completely uninformed users or demagogues. The circles of expertise which promoted them to the centre should also verify and explain their findings to the outer circles. And, concerns and arguments from the user group should be carried back to the epistemic community if the user group finds the points valid. So the epistemic community can work without noise but still receive ongoing feedback from the users and acceptance is a process, not just a binary vote after the fact.","If this all sounds familiar, it’s because this is exactly what happens in open source communities.","In open source software, the code for each project is available for all to see. Even if the end user cannot understand the code, they can go to discussion groups or listen to programmers who have read and audited the code, they can read the bug reports. Any urgent bugs will be broadcast to the general population and amplified by media as we have seen many times. The people with the greater knowledge of the system will provide knowledge bridges for people at a more novice level and increasingly, that’s how people are learning to code. Good ideas from forum discussions can be read, possibly implemented by the developers as well. Transparency goes both ways.","Open source software with forums open to all are a perfect working example of fully transparent and audited systems of elite knowledge. While the decisions are made by the developers, review and acceptance or rejection of the software is the right of the user group. If the developers refuse to listen to the user group and another development team is willing to work on the project, the original code can be forked and modified to meet the user requirements. Which means you can only be attacked by another fully developed, open and transparent epistemic community which also must be audited by knowledge bridges. You can’t be attacked just by a demagogue and rhetoric, you can only be opposed by another working solution so the user group has a choice between two or more working solutions instead of simply rejection or acceptance. Which means we need the final most important point for concentric circles – the information is free for anyone to use or modify.","Imagine if HTML and Javascript were corporate products that were not available to the public to use, like Bill Gates wanted programming languages to be back in the day. We would not be talking about web development frameworks as a stigmergic system. They would be just one proprietary product delivered by one corporation, probably Microsoft. The fact that we won this fight against Bill Gates and those like him is the single biggest reason that programming and IT have progressed so incredibly far and quickly and the reason IT is the best place to look for corporate examples of stigmergy. Just imagine if we had this same freedom to use the end products of other industries, like pharmaceuticals for instance which Bill Gates is currently pushing oppressive IP laws for.","Intellectual property in a stigmergic system is like an ant that finds food but doesn’t leave any pheromones to tell the other ants. Or worse, actually blocks the other ants and that idea is so ridiculous I can’t even think of a stigmergic example of it. Ownership of ideas is in complete opposition to stigmergy which is to say it is in complete opposition to rapid progress, finding the best solutions and democracy.","So what we have been looking for here are methods of collaboration that bring us a balance between autonomy, diversity and society. We want to allow the maximum amount of autonomy to those doing the work so we can include all of their ideas and abilities. We want to allow as many diverse solutions as people are inspired to try for each problem. And then we want to allow the entire user group to easily make an informed choice of which solution is best for them as is their right in a democracy. So our methods are stigmergy, which we use for mass action and concentric circles which we use to audit, teach and amplify information.","The best part of stigmergic work and transparent concentric circles for knowledge is our work doesn’t get wasted. When you come to an event like this with a specific project, it is easy to feel as though you are in a competition where you are only associated with one project and your success or failure is tied to that one project and the group around it. But even if you organize your own team in a completely different form, if you follow these principles you will still be contributing to progress as a node in a stigmergic idea. For this two weeks the idea is: Let’s develop better tools for democracy. If you follow these principles, if other people are free to contribute to your project and you to theirs, if you add what you learn to the epistemic community of ideas and act as a knowledge bridge to those learning and most of all if your code is open and free, you will still be part of the community around this idea contributing to the goal we are all working towards. You will be part of the ecosystem.","Capitalism and the market are an example of Stigmergy. People have needs to fulfill and everyone is able to try to fulfill them and be rewarded for their effort. So Capitalism has market stigmergy and it leads to huge societal inequalities and war.","In every case, stigmergy is enabled by some rules that enable the coordination of the group. In ants, the pheromones and the interaction with them play that role. In Capitalism, it is the market. it is money and it is private property.","It is wrong to propose that what we need is stigmergy, because we already have stigmergy. What we need is the correct type of stigmergy, which means that we need to define specific rules that will have the desired effect. And these rules need to be decided by the people. It is imperative to understand that there are natural laws that determine the outcome of the rules, so we shouldn’t be utopian.","I disagree with those who looked at the work of Lavoie et al and saw natural stigmergic organization. Stigmergy is a method of action based collaboration which follows an idea. With stigmergy, everyone has autonomy as to how or whether they work to further the goal and it does not require direct communication. Capitalism is just plain old hard coercion, do this or you will starve or your children will die. It is just an abstraction of a gun at your head. The “be rewarded for their effort” part means it is not stigmergic but hierarchical, with direction and authority emanating from the place controlling the reward, especially since the reward is not inherent. Also the reward is not so much a reward as it is a lessening of punishment, do this and I will stop preventing you from being able to eat (since we could all eat before capitalism). Capitalism also does not have a group goal. It is a method of coercion, not a method of action based collaboration.","Stigmergy is not “enabled by rules that enable coordination”. With ants, the pheromones are just a trail, not rules (and there is nothing stopping the next ant from changing the trail). Stigmergy can be multi-generational and scale globally so there are no “the people” who get to impose (and enforce) cooperative or coercive rules. That has to be done at the group level. Rules prevent originality of approach and autonomy and are a sign of cooperation or hierarchical coercion, not stigmergy.","I very clearly state that we already have stigmergy here: “We have always had stigmergy in our social lives and it has been behind most mass movements that have had any success.” Stigmergy is not inherently bad or good as it follows an idea which may be either and it allows diversity of methods which may also be either. There is no “correct type of stigmergy”.","The only natural laws capitalism follows is the law of all ponzi schemes. This is unavoidable in every form of capitalism as they impose egalitarian systems on unequal populations. Every form of the trade economy has huge societal inequalities and war built in. Since trade economy is simply an abstraction of ruling coercion there is no such thing as anarcho-capitalism. I am sorry most of my work on this will be in a book called Exceptional Lives which is not published yet but it is explained further in ‘An economy for all’ chapter in Binding Chaos or ‘Stateless ponzi schemes of power’ on this blog and other articles.","”\nStigmergy is a consensus social network mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions.[1] The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity.[2]","Stigmergy is a form of self-organization social network. It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. As such it supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple agents, who lack any memory, intelligence or even individual awareness of each other.[1][3]\n”","> Stigmergy is not inherently bad or good as it follows an idea which may be either and it allows\n> diversity of methods which may also be either. There is no “correct type of stigmergy”.","I am not judging the type of stigmergy based on the result that it produces but on the resulting social structures that it creates.","I use the term ‘rules’ to mean a specific protocol , a series of methods that are required for stigmergy to be possible. If someone does not use these methods, then he is not able to participate, thus he is excluded. This is coercive in my books.","Because rules or enablers of stigmergy are coercive and at the same time create different outcomes, people should be able to decide on these rules.","Ants stigmergy is enabled by pheromones and there is nothing they can do to change this. Humans on the other hand do have a choice.","Rules that have enabled stigmergy in humans are :\nA) The tcp/udp protocol is a requirement for all computers that want to communicate. If you want to use a protocol that noone else uses, then you are out of luck.\nB) Free software development and cooperation is enabled by the free software licenses that restrict what one can do with the source code. The license needs to be enforced for this stigmergy to work.\nC) Capitalism uses money as a signal to coordinate the production. It is stigmergic at the market level, hierarchical at the firm level. At the same time, this is an important case in which the stigmergy that is enabled by money leads to the centralization of economic and political power.","You are proposing specific rules that could enable a specific kind of stigmergy. (concentric circles)\nI like your idea but effectively you are pushing your rules to the others and eventually also the result of the rules.","We need to acknowledge that and try to enable people to determine their own rules/signals.\nOf course, we can and should also propose our own rules.","Stigmergy: Action based method of collaboration which follows an idea. With stigmergy, people do not need to communicate to work on the same project and build something together. As long as everyone understands and agrees on one goal, everyone has autonomy as to how or whether they work to further that goal.","Concentric circle: Idea based collaborative structure. Voices or ideas are peer promoted in a transparent, permeable structure where those at the centre receive the most amplification and ideas are audited and taught to the outer circles by knowledge bridges.","Concentric circles are not the same thing as stigmergy. Stigmergy could very easily (and does) follow ideas which come from any source, not just concentric circles.","Protocols are definitely coercive and people should definitely have both choice and options around protocols. Protocols are not stigmergy however. None of your three examples are examples of stigmergy. They are all protocols, and none of them are necessary to reach the goals you state they are necessary for.","Stigmergy is a method of collaboration which aims for a destination or result. Protocols are paths or methods which you may or may not use to reach that destination or result.","Here is an example of a stigmergic idea: Let’s build a public knowledge repository.","“Stigmergy is a method of collaboration which aims for a destination or result. Protocols are paths or methods which you may or may not use to reach that destination or result. ”","Stigmergy is the result. Protocols/Signals are the enablers of stigmergy. The reality is that you do not have a choice. You do not choose the methods that you use. And you do not choose the social structures that are created by these methods.","Capitalism has indirect communication signals , money. There is no central planning. Everyone is permitted not to work in a job provided by an employer. You have the choice to do it. The reality though is that if you do not work for an employer, you will not be able to survive in most of the cases.","Your proposal can potentially lead to the same problems. But you do not acknowledge that, or your control over the type of social structures that will emerge.","The autonomy that you believe that stigmergy enables is of the type that capitalism provides as well.\nThe question is whether the new rules/signals liberate people, whether people are free to do more things than in Capitalism.","Maybe your proposal does liberate, but you do not mention it anywhere in your talk because you consider that autonomy and freedom are the same thing.","To put it another way, if you have indirect communication/signals, then you can also potentially have indirect coercion.","We explore…and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge…and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias…and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all. - The Mentor"],"isopubdate":"2018-04-06"}

The paper calls it Facebook’s biggest data breach to date.","The details come from a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who said he worked with Aleksandr Kogan, a student at Cambridge University, to obtain the data. Kogan created an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that paid users to take a personality test. Participants had to sign in through their Facebook login and agree to let their data be used for academic purposes.","The app went beyond its seemingly stated scope, however, pulling in data from the friends lists of any test-takers. Facebook’s platform policy only allows developers the use of friend data to enhance a user’s personal experience. The app put that data, from more than 50 million profiles in all, to work instead.","All the data mined from the app became a vital piece of the software Cambridge Analytica used to profile United States voters and serve them with personalized ads ahead of the 2016 election. The U.K. firm has been credited in the past for playing a key role in Donald Trump’s ascent to the White House.","“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie said.","According to The Observer, Facebook “took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals” after learning of the “unprecedented” data harvesting in late 2015. It’s not clear why more drastic steps weren’t taken back then, though yesterday’s action is easier to decode.","Facebook’s Friday suspension of Cambridge Analytica from the platform came four days after The Observer asked the social media company for comment on the whistleblower’s story. Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, was also suspended while the investigation plays out.","Wylie provided The Observer with a dossier of evidence illustrating Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of the data, including emails, invoices, contracts, and bank transfers that point to the scope of the breach. Also in the dossier is an August 2016 letter from Facebook lawyers instructing Wylie to destroy any data collected by Global Science Research, Kogan’s front company.","The letter arrived just a few days before Stephen K. Bannon, a part owner of Cambridge Analytica and former vice president of the company’s board, signed on as Trump’s campaign manager.","Facebook takes the position that data harvested by GSR and Cambridge Analytica doesn’t qualify as a breach. In a statement given to The Observer, the social media company claims Kogan’s app “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” as the info was passed along to third parties.","The company also said Kogan’s app was removed in 2015, and anyone with access to the data had to certify that it had been destroyed. That timing doesn’t line up with Wylie’s August 2016 letter, however.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Facebook vice president Paul Grewal said in a statement."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

{"originalurl":"http://www.deaneckles.com/blog/495_traits-adaptive-systems-dimensionality-reduction/","title":"Traits, adaptive systems & dimensionality reduction | Ready-to-hand","text":["Psychologists have posited numerous psychological traits and described causal roles they ought to play in determining human behavior. Most often, the canonical measure of a trait is a questionnaire. Investigators obtain this measure for some people and analyze how their scores predict some outcomes of interest. For example, many people have been interested in how psychological traits affect persuasion processes. Traits like need for cognition (NFC) have been posited and questionnaire items developed to measure them. Among other things, NFC affects how people respond to messages with arguments for varying quality.","How useful are these traits for explanation, prediction, and adaptive interaction? I can’t address all of this here, but I want to sketch an argument for their irrelevance to adaptive interaction — and then offer a tentative rejoinder.","Interactive technologies can tailor their messages to the tastes and susceptibilities of the people interacting with and through them. It might seem that these traits should figure in the statistical models used to make these adaptive selections. After all, some of the possible messages fit for, e.g., coaching a person to meet their exercise goals are more likely to be effective for low NFC people than high NFC people, and vice versa. However, the standard questionnaire measures of NFC cannot often be obtained for most users — certainly not in commerce settings, and even people signing up for a mobile coaching service likely don’t want to answer pages of questions. On the other hand, some Internet and mobile services have other abundant data available about their users, which could perhaps be used to construct an alternative measure of these traits. The trait-based-adaptation recipe is:","obtain the questionnaire measure of the trait for a sample,","predict this measure with data available for many individuals (e.g., log data),","use this model to construct a measure for out-of-sample individuals.","This new measure could then be used to personalize the interactive experience based on this trait, such that if a version performs well (or poorly) for people with a particular score on the trait, then use (or don’t use) that version for people with similar scores.","But why involve the trait at all? Why not just personalize the interactive experience based on the responses of similar others? Since the new measure of the trait is just based on the available behavioral, demographic, and other logged data, one could simply predict responses based on those measure. Put in geometric terms, if the goal is to project the effects of different message onto available log data, why should one project the questionnaire measure of the trait onto the available log data and then project the effects onto this projection? This seems especially unappealing if one doesn’t fully trust the questionnaire measure to be accurate or one can’t be sure about which the set of all the traits that make a (substantial) difference.","I find this argument quite intuitively appealing, and it seems to resonate with others.1 But I think there are some reasons the recipe above could still be appealing.","One way to think about this recipe is as dimensionality reduction guided by theory about psychological traits. Available log data can often be used to construct countless predictors (or “features”, as the machine learning people call them). So one can very quickly get into a situation where the effective number of parameters for a full model predicting the effects of different messages is very large and will make for poor predictions. Nothing — no, not penalized regression, not even a support vector machine — makes this problem go away. Instead, one has to rely on the domain knowledge of the person constructing the predictors (i.e., doing the “feature engineering”) to pick some good ones.","So the tentative rejoinder is this: established psychological traits might often make good dimensions to predict effects of different version of a message, intervention, or experience with. And they may “come with” suggestions about what kinds of log data might serve as measures of them. They would be expected to be reusable across settings. Thus, I think this recipe is nonetheless deserves serious attention.","I owe some clarity on this to some conversations with Mike Nowak and Maurits Kaptein. [↩]","9 Responses to this post.","Great post. The psychological variables are meaningful to generalize across contexts, but if measurements of these can be obtained by classifying stimuli as such, I would say questionnaire measures of these “traits” seem to add unnecessary complexity and the associated error.","Posted by Dean Eckles on April 21st, 2011 at 10:26 pm","Glad you like it.","I also have the intuition that should help generalize across contexts. But if theory doesn’t tell us how consistent their effects should be (not just the direction), then models for each context must still be fit.","If instead of thinking about the predicted values of the traits as having error, you think about them as linear combinations of other measures, they might seem more useful.","Dean, if we can store 6 billion personality types based on tracked behavior than what is the purpose of even measuring traits anymore?","Thanks for the good ideas, j","Posted by Dean Eckles on April 22nd, 2011 at 1:53 pm","Nice line, Jeremy 🙂","Fitting with the rejoinder above, I’d say that for each person we have p >> n. So borrowing strength from others with similar inferred traits and using substantive knowledge about trait-expression in doing the feature engineering is required!","I would feel more sanguine about this proposal if I had more confidence that “psychological theory”, in the area of personality and individual differences, did not amount to “vintage 1940s data mining”.\nYou are effectively proposing to use the traits as a low-dimensional bottleneck variable for the projection, but then why not search for such bottlenecks directly, using, e.g., auto-encoder techniques? (I know Tong Zhang and co. have worked on that problem, but can’t remember what they’ve published.) More positively, I suppose, if this worked it would give us some evidence that the traits postulated in psychological theory really work.","Posted by Dean Eckles on May 3rd, 2011 at 7:18 pm","Cosma, I generally agree with you. And I enjoy “vintage 1940s data mining” as a term. Thanks for the Zhang pointer: I would like to know more.","To a large extent, I’m more on the side of the first view presented in this post. That is, it seems really odd and counterproductive to project the trait measures onto widely available measures and then project the outcome onto that projection. But too many people started agreeing with me, so I’ve been trying to give the other side a fair shake — despite my ongoing criticism of social & personality psychology.","I do think that psychology can give us some guidance in feature engineering. There is often substantial effort required here. Psych theory — flawed as it is — can suggest some ways to allot this effort that may be fruitful and otherwise neglected. Perhaps it is sad that “feature engineering” is not exactly a high-status enterprise, as it may be the future of what social psych has to offer.","Maybe we will get to test some of this soon.","Posted by Petri Parvinen on June 6th, 2011 at 8:42 pm","Hey Dean, I remembered Maurits mentioned something about this discussion and I dug your this post. We’ve been doing stuff on the hedonic vs. utilitarian distinction, a classical typology and a predictive filter. Here are some reasons our group we still thinks the distinction is useful (some of which you’ve already mentioned):","1. The hed vs. util distinction is efficient (in terms of time, data and number of interactions). Say a salesperson or his client is really busy and there’s only time for one question before making the “personalized” offering. The most useful question has classically been e.g. “business or pleasure?”, “basic or cool?”, “value-for-money or top-of-the-line”, “fun or efficient”. Instead of dumping the distinction, we’re now thinking of how to the distinction it as an ex ante filter (not necessarily based on questionnaires… 😉 ) in interaction in order to make the info processing and profiling more efficient.","2. There are instances where going wrong the first time is really bad, and so testing out different interaction+offerings combos is not a good strategy. Reputation intensive and/or business-to-business settings come to mind. If you need to get it right the first time, you need ex ante psych.","3. Along the lines of your post, we see that the hed/util distinction enables crafting more-than-incremental improvements to offerings, whereas purely data-based will lead to incremental, path-dependent and possibly market-destroying (it’s hard to model the entire market) or other dead-end offerings.","4. Data based optimization is likely to lead to too short-term optimization – or then you need to hold you ‘rithms back. Ex ante constructs can be used to predict how the passing of time, repeats, consistency and other shite like that will be viewed. In pure data based optimization, cheating and lying will be profitable due to e.g. information asymmetries. Even the easiest of them all, the scarcity argument “there’s only two left in stock”, can be abused if you cover up well…","We’re putting a lot of eggs in the basket that the hed vs. util distinction will actually yield something relevant. Let’s see how it goes..","Posted by Dean Eckles on June 7th, 2011 at 4:32 pm","Thanks for the detailed comments, Petri. I like the point that often there are opportunities to make inquires that are context appropriate and may even increase credibility.","You’re right that relying on responses to previous persuasive attempts doesn’t work in any one-shot scenarios.","But non-trait-based approach being considered here is not limited to this case: one can use many other behavioral signals to predict an individual’s response, most of which may not be their past responses to similar stimuli.","Then the question is whether you should use the available signal to predict traits and then predict responses with predicted traits — or whether you should just predict responses with the available signals directly. Does “theoretical” knowledge about traits provide useful dimensionality reduction here?","Yes, that’s one of the major questions we are looking forward to solving.","Rambling on: There are two uses how the theoretical typologies could reduce dimensionality, I guess – idenfication (“who-to”) and offering (“what”). Say someone behaves in a certain way online – instead of looking for the closest historical “success case”, we could look for signs of a typology. Particularly if the, say browsing, histories are very unique, the probability of hitting home with a typologisation “he’s a hedonist!” might be way higher than “he’s pretty much like that other guy who bought from us last week.","The problem with typology could be that particularly in cases where the offering has a large number of permutations, a simple two-sided typology will produce suboptimal offers. There typology needs to be utilized, but not alone, in designing the offering. I have a feeling that there needs to be a “kink in the offering curve” for the typologizations to work at this stage – e.g. providing a radically different offering, crafting an entirely new offering or not offering anything at all (because of negative network effects..)","Respond to this post","Name (required)","Mail (will not be published) (required)","Website","About","This blog is about people, technology, and inference — sometimes as part of the design and evaluation of new interactions, interventions, and techniques.","Dean Eckles is a social scientist, statistician, and faculty at MIT.

The company, Cambridge Analytica, has been accused of improperly using information from more than 50 million Facebook accounts. It denies wrongdoing.","The chairman of the UK parliamentary media committee, Damian Collins, said Tuesday that his group has repeatedly asked Facebook how it uses data and that Facebook officials \"have been misleading to the committee.\"","\"It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,\" Collins wrote in a note addressed directly to Zuckerberg. \"Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to 'fixing' Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.\"","All legal powers","The request to appear comes as Britain's information commissioner said she was using all her legal powers to investigate the social media giant and Cambridge Analytica over the alleged misuse of data.","Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's servers. She has also asked Facebook to cease in its efforts to pursue its own audit of Cambridge Analytica's data use.","\"Our advice to Facebook is to back away and let us go in and do our work,\" she said.","Cambridge Analytica said it is committed to helping the UK investigation. However, Denham gave the firm a deadline to produce the information she requested — and it failed to meet it, her office said.","Denham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires platforms like Facebook to have strong safeguards against misuse of data.","Chris Wylie, who once worked for Cambridge Analytica, was quoted as saying the company used the data to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.","Alleged wrongdoing","The firm found itself in further allegations of wrongdoing. Britain's Channel 4 used an undercover investigation to record Cambridge Analytica's chief executive, Alexander Nix, saying that the company could use unorthodox methods to wage successful political campaigns for clients.","He said the company could \"send some girls\" around to a rival candidate's house, suggesting that girls from Ukraine are beautiful and effective in this role.","He also said the company could \"offer a large amount of money\" to a rival candidate and have the whole exchange recorded so it could be posted on the internet to show that the candidate was corrupt.","According to the investigation by Britain’s Channel 4, the executives claimed to have worked in more 200 elections across the world, including Argentina, the Czech Republic, India, Kenya and Nigeria.","Nix says in a statement on the company's website that he deeply regrets his role in the meeting and has apologized to staff.","\"I am aware how this looks, but it is simply not the case,\" he said. \"I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purposes.\"","Nix told the BBC the Channel 4 sting was \"intended to embarrass us.\"","\"We see this as a co-ordinated attack by the media that's been going on for very, very many months in order to damage the company that had some involvement with the election of Donald Trump,\" he said.","The data harvesting used by Cambridge Analytica has also triggered calls for further investigation from the European Union, as well as federal and state officials in the United States."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

We hope you understand, and consider subscribing for unlimited online access.","Messenger Kids, its first grab at the under-13 crowd, is not to be trusted. After all, you’ve seen how the company treats adults.","That’s what the world’s largest social network is asking parents with the release of its first app for children, Messenger Kids. It’s a pint-size version of Facebook’s chat app, Messenger (which, like Facebook itself, is intended only for those 13 and older). With Messenger Kids, Facebook becomes the first of the major social networks to put out an app specifically for children under 13.","The move makes sense in some ways. Chat apps are everywhere, so why keep them out of the hands of children? It could even help parents teach them about online etiquette.","And it’s a no-brainer for Facebook, whose teenage users are becoming increasingly enamored of competing apps like Snapchat, Twitter, and Kik. With Messenger Kids, perhaps, Facebook can hook younger children on its brand.","“It’s like Coca-Cola inventing a kids’ soda product.”","The app seems to be part of Facebook’s response to the concerns voiced by a growing number of people—including early Facebook investors like Sean Parker, as well as formerexecutives—about the social network’s powers of manipulation. In controversial experiments, it has proved it can alter people’s moods or their likelihood of voting by tweaking their news feeds. And during the most recent US presidential election campaign, the company admitted, Russian-backed political content reached 126 million American Facebook users, showing how vulnerable the platform is to abuse.","In an attempt to assuage worries about fake news, Facebook recently announced it will show regular Facebook users fewer posts from companies and news media and more from their friends. With the new app, it’s creating a purportedly safe space for children, too. Messenger Kids is meant chiefly for texting and video-chatting with parent-approved friends and family, and it includes fun features like digital stickers and animated masks.","But do I want my young child to use Messenger Kids? The answer is the same as some people’s relationship status on Facebook: it’s complicated. It’s good that children have a chance to grow gradually into social apps, but I don’t necessarily want Facebook to be the teacher.","Kids and apps","For a long time, in order to avoid running afoul of a US federal law, the biggest social networks have simply made it against their rules for anyone under 13 to sign up. Called COPPA, or the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule, the law restricts how companies collect, use, and share online data from kids and aims to give parents control over this data gathering.","Tristan Harris thinks big tech is taking advantage of us all. Can its power be used for good?","But COPPA is clearly ineffective. Three out of five American parents in a 2017 poll conducted on behalf of Facebook and the National PTA (one of the groups Facebook consulted while building Messenger Kids) said that their under-13-year-olds use messaging apps, social media, or both. If you take into account sneakier kids and more oblivious parents, the real figure is likely to be much higher.","The design of Messenger Kids is evidently meant to put parents at ease. It’s full of parental controls; kids must get a parent’s authorization (via the parent’s own Facebook account) to sign up and to add each new contact.","However, the app also has some of the very grown-up features you find on Messenger. For instance, if you send a contact a message on Messenger Kids, it lets you know if the person is online or how long it’s been since he or she was active. It will also tell you whether the person you’ve sent a message to has viewed it already and if so, for recently sent messages, when.","That kind of information can cause anxiety even in adults who’ve already spent years using apps. And habituating kids to always-on communication concerns Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who cofounded and runs the Center for Humane Technology. “It’s like Coca-Cola inventing a kids’ soda product,” he says. “It still has to sell sugar; it can’t really be genuinely concerned with the well-being of kids.”","Facebook","Social cues and tech blues","Researchers at San Diego State University and Florida State University recently found that teens who spent a lot of time using smartphones for things like social media were more likely to be depressed. The work, which shows teen suicide and depression rates climbing in the US since 2010, suggests that these issues are linked to the swift rise in smartphone ownership across the country.","The suitable messaging app for young children probably looks nothing like a mini version of Messenger.","That finding and others have alarmed health and education experts. Nineteen groups and nearly 100 individuals (including Harris) signed a letter in January pleading with Facebook to kill Messenger Kids. “Encouraging kids to move their friendships online will interfere with and displace the face-to-face interactions and play that are crucial for building healthy developmental skills, including the ability to read human emotion, delay gratification, and engage with the physical world,” the group wrote.","Larry Rosen, a psychology professor and author of The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World, says children in the Messenger Kids age group are still honing communication skills, including subtle and nonverbal ones like understanding body language and posture. “I worry we’re introducing something to kids who really don’t need it,” he says, “and I think that the ostensible purpose is wrong, which is to get them started young.”","Parent perspective","Not all parents agree. CJ Kanash is an insurance agent in Erie, Pennsylvania, and a father of five. Four of Kanash’s children are between the ages of six and 10, and each of them has an Amazon tablet with Messenger Kids on it.","Kanash uses Messenger Kids to send his kids reminders. His nine-year-old son from a previous marriage uses it to say good night to his mom by video chat. “The world is constantly changing, and this is how we’re going to communicate more in the future,” he says. “They should learn how to do it in a responsible way.”","Kids do need to understand how to use technology, and in large part it’s up to parents to help them figure out how. And kids under 13 already use social apps, whether we like it or not. But Facebook shouldn’t be the default simply because we’re familiar with it. The suitable messaging app for young children probably looks nothing like a mini version of Messenger.","For instance, the Children’s Design Guide, released in January by a group of designers, researchers, and child and education experts, suggests building digital products that encourage kids to use them in moderation and stop them from sharing potentially harmful information. Meanwhile, Harris and the rest of the letter writers recommend that kids simply use a parent’s Facebook or Skype account if they want to connect with far-flung family.","There’s little hard research, however, on what a healthy social-media app for kids would look like. As a result, we’re running a huge experiment with our children. We haven’t had enough time for a generation of kids to grow up with online platforms and report back on how it’s affected them. All we have to go on is what we already know: that Facebook’s treatment of its older users doesn’t bode well for its new focus on kids, no matter how cute and fun the app looks.","As MIT Technology Review’s senior editor for mobile, I cover a wide variety of startups and write gadget reviews out of our San Francisco office.

It was originally published on March 7, 2013.","We've spent a lot of time this past year trying to understand how the National Security Agency gathers and stores information about ordinary people. But there's also a thriving public marketfor data on individual Americans—especially data about the things we buy and might want to buy.","Consumer data companies are scooping up huge amountsof consumer information about people around the world and selling it, providing marketers details about whether you're pregnant or divorced or trying to lose weight, about how rich you are and what kinds of cars you drive. But many people still don't know data brokers exist.","The Federal Trade Commission is pushing the companies to give consumers more information and control over what happens to their data. The White House released a report this May outlining concerns that these detailed consumer profiles might lead to race or income-based discrimination—what the White House called \"digital redlining.\"","It's very hard to tell who is collecting or sharing your data—or what kinds of information companies are collecting. Early this year, Office Max sent a letter to a grieving father addressed to his name, followed by \"daughter killed in car crash.\"","Here's a look at what we know—and what we don't—about the consumer data industry.","How much do these companies know about individual people?","They start with the basics, like names, addresses and contact information, and add on demographics, like age, race, occupation and \"education level,\" according to consumer data firm Acxiom's overview of its various categories.","But that's just the beginning: The companies collect lists of people experiencing \"life-event triggers\" like getting married, buying a home, sending a kid to college—or even getting divorced.","Equifax said in a statement that the information is only sold to customers \"who have been verified through a detailed credentialing process.\" It added that if a mortgage company or other lender wants to access information about your salary, they must obtain your permission to do so.","Of course, data companies typically don't have all of this information on any one person. As Acxiom notes in its overview, \"No individual record ever contains all the possible data.\" And some of the data these companies sell is really just a guess about your background or preferences, based on the characteristics of your neighborhood, or other people in a similar age or demographic group.","Where are they getting all this info?","The stores where you shop sell it to them.","Datalogix, for instance, which collects information from store loyalty cards, says it has information on more than $1 trillion in consumer spending \"across 1400+ leading brands.\" It doesn't say which ones. (Datalogix did not respond to our requests for comment.)","Data companies usually refuse to say exactly what companies sell them information, citing competitive reasons. And retailers also don't make it easy for you to find out whether they're selling your information.","Only two companies actually responded with details about how volunteers' information had been shared. Upscale furniture store Restoration Hardware said that it had sent \"your name, address and what you purchased\" to seven other companies, including a data \"cooperative\" that allows retailers to pool data about customer transactions, and another company that later became part of Datalogix. (Restoration Hardware hasn't responded to our request for comment.)","Walt Disney also responded and described sharing even more information: not just a person's name and address and what they purchased, but their age, occupation, and the number, age and gender of their children. It listed companies that received data, among them companies owned by Disney, like ABC and ESPN, as well as others, including Honda, HarperCollins Publishing, Almay cosmetics, and yogurt company Dannon.","But Disney spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said that Disney's letter, sent in 2007, \"wasn't clear\" about how the data was actually shared with different companies on the list. Outside companies like Honda only received personal information as part of a contest, sweepstakes, or other joint promotion that they had done with Disney, Mucha said. The data was shared \"for the fulfillment of that contest prize, not for their own marketing purposes.\"","Where else do data brokers get information about me?","Government records and other publicly available information, including some sources that may surprise you. Your state Department of Motor Vehicles, for instance, may sell personal information— like your name, address, and the type of vehicles you own—to data companies, although only for certain permitted purposes, including identify verification.","Are there limits to the kinds of data these companies can buy and sell?","Yes, certain kinds of sensitive data are protected—but much of your information can be bought and sold without any input from you.","Federal law protects the confidentiality of your medical recordsand your conversations with your doctor. There are also strict rules regarding the sale of information used to determine your credit-worthiness, or your eligibility for employment, insurance and housing. For instance, consumers have the right to view and correct their own credit reports, and potential employers have to ask for your consent before they buy a credit report about you.","Other than certain kinds of protected data—including medical records and data used for credit reports—consumers have no legal right to control or even monitor how information about them is bought and sold. As the FTC notes, \"There are no current lawsrequiring data brokers to maintain the privacy of consumer data unless they use that data for credit, employment, insurance, housing, or other similar purposes.\"","So they don't sell information about my health?","Actually, they do.","Data companies can capture information about your \"interests\" in certain health conditions based on what you buy—or what you search for online. Datalogix has lists of people classified as \"allergy sufferers\" and \"dieters.\"Acxiom sells data on whether an individual has an \"online search propensity\" for a certain \"ailment or prescription.\"","Consumer data is also beginning to be used to evaluate whether you're making healthy choices.","One health insurance companyrecently bought data on more than three million people's consumer purchases in order to flag health-related actions, like purchasing plus-sized clothing, the Wall Street Journal reported. (The company bought purchasing information for current plan members, not as part of screening people for potential coverage.)","Spokeswoman Michelle Douglas said that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina would use the data to target free programming offers to their customers.","Douglas suggested that it might be more valuable for companies to use consumer data \"to determine ways to help me improve my health\" rather than \"to buy my data to send me pre-paid credit card applications or catalogs full of stuff they want me to buy.\"","Do companies collect information about my social media profiles and what I do online? (Updated June 12, 2014)","Yes.","As we highlighted last year, some data companies record—and then resell—all kinds of information you post online, including your screen names, website addresses, interests, hometown and professional history, and how many friends or followers you have.","Acxiom said it collects information about which social media sites individual people use, and \"whether they are a heavy or a light user,\" but that they do not collect information about \"individual postings\" or your \"lists of friends.\"","More traditional consumer data can also be connected with information about what you do online. Datalogix, the company that collects loyalty card data, has partnered with Facebook to track whether Facebook users who see ads for certain products actually end up buying them at local stores, as the Financial Times reported in 2012.","In fact, the effort to connect online and offline information about you is one of the hottest new trends in the data industry. Companies are increasingly trying to use information about your offline purchases to target you online.","And it's not limited to what you buy: in the 2012 elections, companies were able to match your voting record to a cookie on your computer—allowing candidates to target you with online ads based on whether you're a registered Democrat or Republican—or how much you donated to political campaigns before.","Is there a way to find out exactly what these data companies know about me? (Updated 6/12/2013)","Not really—although that's beginning to change.","You have the right to review and correct your credit report. But with marketing data, there's often no way to know exactly what information is attached to your name—or whether it's accurate.","Most companies offer, at best, a partial picture.","ProPublica's Julia Angwin requested information about herself from data brokers, and was \"equally irked by the reports that were wrong—data brokers who thought I was a single mother with no education—as I was by the ones that were correct—is it necessary for someone to track that I recently bought underwear online?\"","Previously, Acxiom only let customers review a smaller sliceof the information the company sells about them, including criminal history, as New York Times reporter Natasha Singer described in 2012. When Singer requested and finally received her report in 2012, all it included was a record of her residential addresses.","Other companies also offer some access. A spokeswoman for Epsilon said it allows consumers to review \"high level information\" about their data—like whether or not you've purchased \"home furnishings\" merchandise. (Requests to review this information cost $5 and can only be made by postal mail.)","RapLeaf, a company that advertises that it has \"real-time data\" on 80 percent of U.S. email addresses, says it gives customers \"total control over the data we have on you,\" and allows them to review and edit the categories it associates with them (like \"estimated household income\" and \"Likely Political Contributor to Republicans\").","How do I know when someone has purchased data about me?","Most of the time, you don't.","When you're checking out at a store and a cashier asks you for your Zip code, the store isn't just getting that single piece of information. Acxiom and other data companies offer services that allow stores to use your Zip code and the name on your credit card to pinpoint your home address— without asking you for it directly.","Is there any way to stop the companies from collecting and sharing information about me? (Updated 6/12/2013)","Of the 212 data brokers she identified, less than half—92—accepted opt-outs. For most of them, the op-out process was laborious. Many required her to submit some form of identification, such as a driver's license, in order to opt out. In some cases, she wrote, \"I decided not to opt-out because the service seemed so sketchy that I didn't want to send in any additional information.\"","But she was able to clear her information from some databases: \"A search for my name on some of the largest people-search websites, such as Intelius and Spokeo, yields no relevant results,\" she wrote.","In a 2012 privacy report, the FTC suggested that data brokers should create a centralized websitethat would make it easier for consumers to learn about the existence of these companies and their rights regarding the data they collect.","How many people do these companies have information on?","Basically everyone in the U.S. and many beyond it. Acxiom, recently profiled by the New York Times, says it has information on 500 million people worldwide, including \"nearly every U.S. consumer.\"","Mostly to sell you stuff. Companies want to buy lists of people who might be interested in what they're selling—and also want to learn more about their current customers.","They also sell their information for other purposes, including identity verification, fraud prevention and background checks.","If new privacy laws are passed, will they include the right to see what data these companies have collected about me?","Unlikely.","In a 2012 report on privacy, the Federal Trade Commission recommended that Congress pass legislation\"that would provide consumers with access to information about them held by a data broker.\" President Barack Obama has also proposed a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rightsthat would give consumers the right to access and correct certain information about them.","But this probably won't include access to marketing data, which the Federal Trade Commission considers less sensitive than data used for credit reports or identity verification.","In terms of marketing data, \"we think at the very least consumers should have access to the general categories of data the companies have about consumers,\" said Maneesha Mithal of the FTC's Division of Privacy and Identity Protection.","Data companies have also pushed back against the idea of opening up marketing profiles for individual consumers' inspection.","Even if there were errors in your marketing data profile, \"the worst thing that could happen is that you get an advertising offer that isn't relevant to you,\" said Rachel Thomas, the vice president of government affairs at the Direct Marketing Association.","\"The fraud and security risks that you run by opening up those files is higher than any potential harm that could happen to the consumer,\" Thomas said.","How do data brokers impact you?

One jumped at it","text":["There are numerous reasons fair game for finger-pointing, but to truly leverage any of those elements required data and know-how. Russia clearly used both to help influence an election. They and others may have used that knowledge to spread fake news.","One of the best catalysts for spreading the message — fake or otherwise — and reaching voters at the heart of their concerns was Facebook, which was right there with the campaigns, trying to help. But did one campaign accept more help than other other and, in doing so, help to sabotage their own presidential aspirations?","Reaching heartland voters on the topics they cared about, like infrastructure, required a Ph.D. in social media, data mechanics tools, and ad delivery. It's in that last department — getting ads in front of the right eyeballs — where the Clinton campaign may have lost its edge, at least according to one member of the team that helped Donald Trump take the White House.","Trump Campaign Digital Director Brad Parscale told 60 Minutes this week that when he emailed Facebook asking for “every single secret button, click, technology you have,” the social network agreed to send its staffers to sit with the Trump campaign advertising and data operation. This quality time reportedly happened as frequently as five days a week.","According to Parscale, the Clinton campaign was offered a similar set of embeds and turned them down.","In a single day, Parscale’s operation averaged 50,000-to-60,000 ads a day. He claims he was even able to choose the individual Facebook employees who would work with his operation based on whether they leaned Republican or Democrat. (He says he chose all Republicans, naturally.)","It was Parscale’s job to make the ads and figure out what was going to make people react, but his data game was certainly strengthened by Facebook employees who sat next to him explaining exactly how to use their tools to make that happen.","Parscale's assertions to 60 Minutes that the Facebook employees worked with him full-time, and the more explosive claim that they let him hand-pick embeds by political affiliation, don't hold up. From the post:","\"The campaigns did not get to 'hand pick' the people who worked with them from Facebook. And no one from Facebook was assigned full-time to the Trump campaign, or full-time to the Clinton campaign. Both campaigns approached things differently and used different amounts of support.\"","Facebook's comments mirror those of Twitter, which offered similar help to both campaigns:","Twitter provides nonpartisan ad sales resources to advertisers around the world, helping them use our ad sales platform efficiently. In 2016 we offered such resources to both the Clinton and Trump campaigns, as well as gubernatorial and Senate races across both parties.\"","One thing is clear from Facebook's response. One camp, either Trump or Clinton, didn't take as much advantage of Facebook was offering. Based on what Parscale claims — and considering he's already been caught in at least one possible lie, we have to take it all with a grain of salt — it wasn't the Trump camp. His campaign sounded especially eager to tap into the power of Facebook's ad-targeting tools.","What's also unclear is the extent to which Facebook's assistance actually helped.","At least at the start of the campaign, Clinton and Trump were on a level playing field. Both campaigns had data operations. Clinton reportedly built her own.","“I was very proud of my data and analytics team. They were largely veterans of the Obama campaigns, ’08, ’12, and then we brought in new people and brought in a lot of new expertise to build the next generation,” she told Walt Mossberg at this year’s Code Conference.","In reality, however, her data game wasn’t nearly as strong as what was coming out of the Trump campaign.","Clinton contends that Cambridge Analytica played a role here and essentially handed Trump’s team even more powerful data and personality-based targeting tools.","Clinton said she was aware that “the other side” had content farms and was using them to deliver “false content… in a very personalized way, both sort of above the radar and below.\" She also knew that a lot of this false information and news about her was flowing through Facebook.","Not helping matters was the Democratic National Committee, which was in bad shape. “I mean it was bankrupt, it was on the verge of insolvency, its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong,” she told Recode's Walt Mossberg. And so there was no data operation for Clinton to inherit.","Suffice to say Clinton had no confidence in the DNC’s data game, and she was worried about the powerful Republican data operation and its potential to impact voters via platforms like Facebook. Did that spur her to lean on Facebook's team as Parscale claims he did? There's no clear answer here, and we may never know.","But if Clinton had won, it's quite possible it would have been her digital director extolling the virtues of Facebook's ad tools on 60 Minutes.","Parscale painted a compelling picture for 60 minutes of how good those Facebook tools are for crafting and recrafting messages until you trigger the right response. The same issue ad, for instance, could be served thousands of times with slightly different art, colors, text. It could also deliver ads focusing on different topics to people living next door to each other. Imagine the impact this might have on gerrymandered swing states where you can map an issue to align with known voting blocks (gerrymandering tends to group people of certain party affiliations and ideologies).","Clinton's team probably didn't take the same kind of advantage of those tools, but the disparity between Clinton and Trump's approach in this area may have been one of degrees.","With so many factors at play and the scope of Russian interference in the election still being discovered, it’s hard to point to how Clinton campaign used or didn't use Facebook embeds as a singular contributing factor in her loss, but it’s also hard to deny that it didn’t have some impact.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

The gist of this article is not to offer a description of the facts that have already been given by media but to analyze some of the most relevant corporate social responsibility issues arising from this scandal.","The irresponsible behavior of social-media corporations","The Cambridge Analytica scandal has demonstrated for the umpteenth time that social-media companies have adopted an irresponsible business model. Companies like Facebook have become incredibly powerful because of the combination of their addictive-by-design nature and the capability of collecting data about the users’ behaviors.","For instance, using the simple expedient of introducing the “like” button, which enables users to easily interact with the content present on the platform, Facebook has gained from 2009 onwards the unrivaled capability of gathering information about personal preferences and recording every single endorsement of its users. It is not surprising that in 2016, Facebook rolled out its new “reactions buttons” across the world. The five new emotions – Love, Angry, Sad, Haha and Wow – give the company greater and more detailed access to users’ personal preferences or feelings. The issue is that the vast majority of users are unaware of the circumstance that this more accurate information may be used to manipulate their own behavior.","The irresponsible corporate conduct of social-media corporations lies in the fact that the access to this incredibly valuable information has not been accompanied by the adoption of adequate measures to avoid any possible misuse of the platform, and to raise the awareness of users about the risks connected with the use of social media. On the one hand, those risks are related to the possible exploitation of such platforms to spread fake news by disinformation operators, who are typically indistinguishable from any other user; on the other, there is the risk that third parties may obtain the personal data gathered by social-media companies and use them in improper ways as it occurred in the Cambridge Analytica case.","It is not surprising that in the last two years, Facebook, Google, and other social-media corporations have contended with several controversies, including charges that they helped spread false news, unwittingly facilitated Russian meddling in the US 2016 election and Brexit referendum, and fanned political polarisation.","In truth, this issue is not related only to social-media companies; other businesses such as cable TV and talk radio can be used to spread fake news. However, because of their very nature, social-media platforms wield extraordinary influence on our democratic societies. Suffice here to say that Americans touch their smartphones on average more than 2,600 times a day and that users in America click the “like” button on Facebook about 4m times a minute. As Tim O’Reilly wrote in his book WTF: What’s the Future and Why It’s Up To Us: “Another big difference between the web and traditional well-controlled collections is that there is virtually no control over what people can put on the web. Couple this flexibility to publish anything with the enormous influence of search engines to route traffic, and companies which deliberately manipulate search engines for profit become a serious problem.”","The political discontent that these issues have generated in our parliamentary democracies is clearly illustrated by the following statement that Sen. Dianne Feinstein made (from min. 13:30) during the hearings that were part of the U.S. Congress’s investigation into Russia’s actions in Trump’s election: “[…] I saw really for the first time how effectively Russia has harnessed the tremendous and, quite frankly to me, frightening power of social media. They showed us how millions of Americans are reached and how Russia successfully used fake accounts […] to shape and manipulate opinions […] What is really staggering and hard to fully comprehend is how easily and successfully they turned modern technology to their advantage.”","The situation is aggravated by the fact that, although the titans of Big Tech have seen how the power of their platforms could reshape the economy and are perfectly aware of those issues, they have not adopted any viable corporate social responsibility solution. It is then understandable that the sector is facing a period of profound crisis characterized by the fact that the population is starting to use social-media platforms less, their costs are soaring, and regulation looms. Earlier this year, the billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros even defined Facebook and Google at the World Economic Forum as a “menace to society.”","Investigative journalists, whistleblowers, and leakers: the heroes of our time","The Cambridge Analytica scandal has underlined again and again the crucial role that investigative journalists, whistleblowers, and leakers play in unveiling corporate misconducts, as well as the shady deals and corrupt practices that constitute the unethical way in which corporate executives operate.","The scandal has been revealed thanks to the painstaking work carried out by the Observer and the Guardian, whose journalists have spent a year analyzing documents, gathering eyewitness reports, and investigating the matter.","Their success has also depended on the courage of two whistleblowers, Shahmir Sanni and Christopher Wylie, who were brave enough to speak about the misconducts perpetrated by Cambridge Analytica.","We also must not forget the importance of leakers, who on many occasions have exposed the true corrupt face of business. It has been only thanks to a series of documents unveiled during the Paradise Papers Scandal that it was revealed how two Russian state institutions with close ties to Vladimir Putin funded substantial investments in Twitter and Facebook to influence the US politics.","Over the course of the last decade, whistleblowers have become of vital importance for revealing the companies who commit serious misconducts and helping the authorities in prosecuting them. Their role has been essential even for fighting against corporate pollutant activities. For instance, it was only thanks to the revelations by a former engineer on a cruise ship that, in December 2016, Princess Cruise Lines paid U.S. federal enforcement authorities $40 million to settle charges the company dumped oily substances into the ocean.","As I mentioned in an article I wrote on the Conversation, as a tribute to the killing of the Maltese investigative journalist and blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia, over the last decade, the most significant steps forward in the fight against corporate misbehaviours have been made thanks to the courage of leakers, whistleblowers and investigative journalists, who help bring the most serious allegations of misconduct to light. They are the true heroes of our time, and the ineffectiveness of internal controls and external auditors means we must rely on them to identify corporate malpractices. So we should do our best to ensure they are supported and protected, and react strongly against any attempt to suppress their actions.","As mere examples, we should put more effort into changing the dominant corporate subculture by which whistleblowers are seen as traitors instead of positive actors; we should establish for all investigative journalists, whistleblowers and leakers, who unveil corrupt practices, protection programs similar to the ones used to protect those who help us in dismantling organized criminal groups; we should lobby for the introduction of programs not only for protecting but also rewarding corporate whistleblowers, as the one created for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission through Section 922 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or, the one introduced more recently in the U.S. by the Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act of 2015, which aims at giving industry insiders a financial incentive to bring to light safety-related problems.","Corporate Misuse of Wealth and Power","Last but not least, the Cambridge Analytica scandal is illustrative of a corporate system based on pure greed, which not only ignores stakeholders’ needs but exploits the weaknesses in society for the sake of profit.","Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica, spoke to undercover reporters from Channel 4 News about the dark arts used by the company to help clients, which included entrapping rival candidates in fake bribery stings and hiring prostitutes to seduce them.","The following statements of Christopher Wylie, one of the Cambridge Analytica whistleblowers, show not only how deeply unethical the conducts perpetrated by the company were but also how the very corporate structure of the company facilitated those irresponsible behaviours: “Yes it was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with […] the psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness […] in the context of the democratic process [Then, in response to the question of the Guardian journalist, who asked Wylie if he thought about the immorality of the business operations he was carrying out, the whistleblower answered] You know… the company… we didn’t do good job at due diligence, so no… we didn’t… […] we were solely focused on gathering those data and doing this experiment.”","The whistleblower also depicted in a clear way the CEO of the company: “[…] Alexander Nix […] he is ambitious he cared more about winning than what we actually did at the company, he is an upper-class Etonian who expects people to follow him wherever he goes.” From this statement, it emerges clearly that the CEO experienced what evolutionary biologists define as the “winner effect,” i.e., a self-destructive, irrational behavior, where risk-taking becomes increasingly foolish. Finally, the scandal is giving serious cause for concern about the education system presently in place. The risk is that, in the competitive environment generated by globalization, schools and universities that offer “elitist” education may in some way foster a conviction in personal success that may easily lead to a corrupt stubbornness that insists on success at any cost. To combat this phenomenon, our educational institutions should focus more on educating future international business leaders on the importance of business ethics and corporate social responsibility.","Great analysis Costa. I would add that Corporate Governance is added to the vital education that is provided to current and future business leaders in conjunction with business ethics and corporate social responsibility. These should be ongoing too; so that irrespective of socioeconomic backgrounds, business leaders are constantly helped to grow in their understanding of risks associated with new technologies. I’m afraid what we have witnessed and are witnessing, may be the beginning of more irresponsibility to come if not urgently and adequately addressed as I advocated in my #AI paper https://corporatesocialresponsibilityblog.com/2018/03/12/a-case-for-the-responsible-use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-global-financial-services/","I think there is a lot more to investigate on the correlation between elitist education and corporate immoral behavior. There is an entire culture of impunity of the elites that has been fostered for generations. Elitist institutions cannot act as a byproduct of the dominant society.","I really enjoyed reading this post, Costa. It kept me engaged throughout and provided a detailed CSR analysis. I would also like to bring to your notice that The Cambridge Analytica scandal has recently also caused an uproar in India’s politics as well. There are numerous suspicious signs accessible that demonstrate that the Congress Party abused the administrations of the organisation.\nThe ruling party, BJP claim that Congress have utilized and abused Cambridge Analytica amid the Gujarat races. Also, when they (Congress) are found to be guilty, they are stating that they have no association with the organisation.\nBJP claim that Congress’s whole online networking effort has been dealt with the assistance of Cambridge Analytica.","Congress meanwhile claim that it is the BJP that have association with Cambridge Analytica. They claimed that online profiles of CA uncover the organization assumed a key part in BJP’s crusade in four states, incorporating Bihar races in 2010. AICC conveyed duplicates of the web profile of CA and its India accomplice Ovelina Business Intelligence (OBI). Congress Party claim that BJP’s industrial facility of phoney news delivers phoney question and answer sessions, counterfeit plans, counterfeit twists and phoney proclamations and that they have turned into the regular character of BJP and its ‘rebellious’ clergyman of law.\nThis is currently a burning issue in the nation!","Today, a must read article has been published by the Financial Times. It is entitled “Why south-east Asia’s politics are proving a problem for Facebook,” and if focuses on many issues related to hate speech and political manipulation that the company is facing in that region."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Now, we are led to believe, that a 20-something year old, with another Russian nerd, researching social media stuff while in Cambridge University, with funds from shadowy rightwingers, and radical right wing commentators, and some idiot with a posh-sounding name, somehow, managed to change the world as it was known, thanks to some ads deployed through Facebook.","What utter bullshit. Elections aren’t won by nerds, statisticians, or blody Facebook ads, however well calibrated. Elections aren’t won by profiling 50, or 200 million people in social media. Elections aren’t won by spending in the latest data mining tool. Just remember, every time some inane and baseless comment is made about how Cambridge Analytica hackers “turned the tide”, that Trump lost the popular vote and won thanks to Electoral Colleges votes.","Elections are lost by incumbents. America was tired and, largely, ashamed of George W Bush. That is why Obama won. America was tired and, largely, disappointed of Obama. Hope didn’t translate into much. That is why Trump won (Hillary sheer arrogance, stupidity, connections and behaviour, and the GOP’s clusterfuck didn’t help either). Spain was tired, very tired, of Jose Maria Aznar and the rampant corruption of his party. Lying about a massive terrorist attack that caused hundreds of deaths, just hours before a general election, didn’t help either. That is why Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero won. Venezuelans were truly desperate of mismanagement, corruption, poverty, lack of prospects, rampant criminality, after 40 years of living under a rather dysfunctional democracy that had failed to improve their lot. That is why Hugo Chavez won.","And Brits, outside comfortable bubbles inhabited by the “sophisticated bunch” that write for The Guardian, were / are, largely, an utterly chauvinistic bunch (like the rest of the world). They didn’t like one bit Theresa May’s failure to control borders (she couldn’t do it anyway). They disliked the massive influx of Europeans coming to “get their jobs, housing and social benefits”. That is why Brexit won. Neither Nigel Farage, nor that Boris / Gove pair of imbeciles made their countrymen the way they are. Facebook ads wizardry didn’t turn Brits insular, parochial, tribal… It is just how they are.","I think it is irresponsable, inaccurate and ignorant in the extreme to attribute electoral victories to the likes of Cambridge Analytica, or the red-haired hacker. Electoral results, in countries where democracy actually works, are for the most part a true representation of the majority’s prevailing wisdom at a given time. That wisdom is not instilled by social media ads. People don’t become racists after watching a video, or reading a message crafted by some nerd, or joining a Facebook group. Facebook is just a medium that facilitates people with similar outlooks, past relations, etc., to come together. To say that people with certain tendencies have become more prone to influence thanks to Facebook, ignores history, human behaviour, religion, etc. Wylie said that his tool could “predict” how people were going to vote according to their Facebook likes. Well guess what mate, any imbecile could do that without a “psychological warfare tool” or Cambridge Analytica.","Racism, chauvinism, tribalism, mysoginism, etc., are not the consequence of “warfare tools”, but part of every individual behavioural framework. Every person believes (or not) in something, and expresses those beliefs, to a greater or lesser degree in public, depending on social convention of environment in which said person lives and operates. That is, we are creatures of our social environments. What’s acceptable in a meeting between Bannon, Trump, Milo and Katie Hopkins may not be acceptable in another between Seumas Milne, Jeremy Corbyn and Hugo Chavez. That doesn’t mean that the deep-seated core beliefs of each group is going to get altered at election time by nerds, or money: no amount of Koch’s money is going to make Trump palatable to a large section of America’s population, and no amount of Fusion GPS fiction is going to make Hillary popular with rednecks. Ideologies and beliefs, as religion, are almost impossible to change.","Only introspection, or dramatic events, change people. Brits probably wouldn’t vote again for Brexit. Americans, erm, not so sure about Trump. Venezuelans, given the opportunity to vote in free and fair elections, won’t ever elect a chavista candidate again. Ditto Brazilians with Lula, Indians with Modi… Social media can’t contain, or alter in any meaningful way, tidal changes in politics."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

A hero for public opinion, an enemy of the state for governments and secret services. In fact he asked twenty-one countries for protection, mostly European nations, and they completely shut their doors to him. In a newly published book \"Women, Whistleblowing, WikiLeaks\" by Renata Avila, Sarah Harrison and Angela Richter (Or Books), fresh details of this global manhunt emerge, revealing what was happening behind the scenes as the social networks, reporters and TVs pursued Edward Snowden alongside the US government.","Yes, because as soon as Snowden handed the top-secret NSA documents to journalists Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill, the United States government immediately charged him, using a draconian law created in 1917: the Espionage Act. \"A law which has been around for a hundred years that doesn't distinguish between leaks to the press in the public interest and selling secrets to foreign enemies for a personal profit\", explains Snowden's US lawyer, Ben Wizner, to Repubblica, elaborating on the serious impact of this law on journalistic sources: \"There is no investigative journalism without unauthorized sources\", says Wizner. Today Snowden lives in exile in Russia, where he only has a temporary residence permit.","Many thought he would end up very badly, but when he connects via videolink for this interview with la Repubblica, he seems to be doing very well: the frank smile and peaceful face of someone who is easy in his mind. He says he is definitely gratified with how the course of his life has changed since he stopped working for the government and started working for the public, and his agenda is filled with conferences and seminars in colleges and universities around the world, which has also allowed him to earn an income over these last few years.","Five years have passed since you revealed the NSA's mass surveillance activities, and we have just seen dozens of US Democrats voting with the Trump Administration to renew the NSA's surveillance powers, we've seen Italy approve a law which extends mandatory data retention to six years, but we've also seen a UK Court ruling that the UK's mass surveillance regime is unlawful. The debate is still ongoing and the picture is mixed. In the long run, will mass surveillance be downsized in our democracies, or will it continue to flourish?","\"That's a big question...(he smiles). For one it's certainly a real shame, I think, for the Democratic party, and unfortunately this has become quite routine, that the party that is presenting itself as a progressive force is so often joining in to limit the rights that the public enjoys. I don't think this is unique to the Democratic Party, we see this happening even in countries that don't share the same dynamics. What we are seeing is a new kind of creeping authoritarianism spreading across the globe.","Having said that, we have made some limited progress: in the United States, of course, we had the passage of the USA Freedom Act, which is the first surveillance law in 40 years that limited the powers of intelligence agencies rather than expanding them, but it is not guaranteed that this progress will continue, and in fact we see laws like the section 702 of the FISA [the NSA's surveillance powers reauthorized by the U.S. Congress].","This is why we see technologists increasingly working to develop new means of enforcing human rights, through systems that apply without regard to what jurisdiction you are currently in. Let's say you're Italian, or you're Belgian or you are French and you want to protect people's rights. Naturally, you look at your community, so you design a system that enforces the rights that you are used to in Italy, which no matter what people say about the political troubles of Italy, it's certainly not the worst country in the world, but when we start looking at more troubled societies and we look at the Russias and the Chinas of the world, they have much lower regard for digital rights. If that Italian system or Belgian system works globally, it can spread immediately, more quickly than governments can react. Instantaneously, an Italian can be protecting the rights of a Chinese person, of an African person, an American person\".","Many documents of the so-called \"Snowden archive\" remain unpublished, would you like to see them published?","\"I think this is a way to get to some of the criticism there has been about the rate of publication (he smiles). There is still work to be done, for sure, and I hope that the archive will continue to be useful to journalists. On the other hand, there are parts of the archive that were never intended for publication, they have, for example, the names of the terrorist targets. The idea is: journalists need to have the context to understand when the government is lying to them. Not every detail in the archive would be in the public interest to know, but many of them are.","This is why I pursued the model I did, where journalists review the documents, they go to the government, they challenge the government on whether these things should be in the public domain, the government can say: we disagree with you, which is what they always do, but that doesn't stop the reporting, journalists should have the final say here, not some bureaucrat.","Is this the right model? I don't know, but I was very careful in putting this model together to intentionally be overly cautious, to be more careful than was necessary, for a specific reason: as we have seen in the Chelsea Manning case, in many of the WikiLeaks disclosures, the government instantaneously responds in the event of any leak of classified information that is embarrassing, but not damaging, by claiming that it is dangerous, by virtue of the very fact that this was classified information, it claims that it is dangerous information\".","We have seen how the US government has spent years accusing WikiLeaks of putting lives at risk, but in the end, during the trial of Chelsea Manning, the government was forced to admit that no one died, no one was hurt...","\"They do this every time, that is why journalists are working so hard to be, again, more careful than necessary. This project [publishing the Snowden files] is about something larger than surveillance, it is about democracy, and the idea here is: if we can't understand what the government is doing, our votes lose their meaning.","Therefore we need a strong example: even the most secret documents in the United States government can be published openly without causing harm, because now more than five years later, the government has never ever showed anyone who died, anyone who was harmed, and if that was the case, they would have immediately been leaking it to the press to discredit myself and the journalists\".","Thanks to your files we exposed how the NSA targets Italy. Thanks to WikiLeaks, we published the NSA's intercepts of our former PM, Berlusconi. The Italian judiciary opened an investigation, but we never heard again from the prosecutors. Italy is the only country in the world whose judiciary nailed 23 CIA operatives who renditioned the Milan cleric, Abu Omar. We succeeded in obtaining accountability for the CIA, but not for the NSA. Why?","\"You said we got accountability for the case of torture, which is an important thing: if we can't hold torturers or kidnappers accountable to law, what does the law mean? It is true that Italy tried these people and it did convict them, but it is not as if they are sitting in prison today. This is better than the alternative, which is that they never face any justice at all, but at the same time, it is not true accountability. It is ultimately this fear of consequences that it is necessary, if we want to be able to control the activities of intelligence services not just within our own country, but internationally.","Now the CIA case is unique, because like most human intelligence services, it is actually putting people into that country. But people screw up. If you read the history of the Abu Omar case, these were not Jason Bourne or James Bond, because those people in real life do not exist. They were normal bureaucrats with a little bit of training, who get lazy, miss home and they call their wives, their husbands from the hotel phone, when they were supposed to be pretending to be an entirely different person.","The NSA is not typically entering these other countries in person. If they are, they do it for very short periods and there are no real witnesses, because the things they operate on are machines, instead of human beings. So the NSA has less exposure, generally, than the CIA. But I think actually the largest distinction is in terms of political will: if the Italian prosecutors had wanted to demand that the next time U.S. diplomatic representatives, or the CIA chief in Italy, or the intelligence partners in the US, had engaged in Italy, that they would be required to testify, under oath, before a court, they certainly could have done that. They chose not to. And it is important to understand that that is always a conscious political choice\".","We saw that President Obama, who was an outsider to the US military-intelligence complex, initially wanted to reign in the abuses of agencies like the CIA and the NSA, but in the end he did very little. Now we see a confrontation between president Trump and so-called Deep State, which includes the CIA and the NSA. Can a US president govern in opposition to such powerful entities?","\"Obama is certainly an instructive case. This is a president who campaigned on a platform of ending warrantless wiretapping in the United States, he said \"that's not who we are, that's not what we do\", and once he became the president, he expanded the program. He said he was going to close Guantanamo but he kept it open, he said he was going to limit extrajudicial killings and drone strikes that has been so routine in the Bush years. But Obama went on to authorize vastly more drone strikes than Bush. It became an industry.","As for this idea that there is a Deep State, now the Deep State is not just the intelligence agencies, it is really a way of referring to the career bureaucracy of government. These are officials who sit in powerful positions, who don't leave when presidents do, who watch presidents come and go, they influence policy, they influence presidents and say: this is what we have always done, this is what we must do, and if you don't do this, people will die. It is very easy to persuade a new president who comes in, who has never had these powers, but has always wanted this job and wants very, very badly to do that job well. A bureaucrat sitting there for the last twenty years says: I understand what you said, I respect your principles, but if you do what you promised, people will die. It is very easy for a president to go: well, for now, I am going to set this controversy to the side, I'm going to take your advice, let you guys decide how these things should be done, and then I will revisit it, when I have a little more experience, maybe in a few months, maybe in a few years, but then they never do.","This is what we saw quite clearly happen in the case of Barack Obama: when this story [of Snowden exposing the NSA's mass surveillance] came forward in 2013, when Obama had been president for five years, one of the defences for this from his aides and political allies was: oh, Obama was just about to fix this problem! And sure enough, he eventually was forced from the wave of criticism to make some limited reforms, but he did not go far enough to end all of the programs that were in violation of the law or the constitution of the United States.","That too was an intentional choice: he could have certainly used the scandal to advocate for all of the changes that he had campaigned on, to deliver on all of his promises, but in those five years he had become president, he discovered something else, which is that there are benefits from having very powerful intelligence agencies, there are benefits from having these career bureaucrats on your side, using their spider web over government for your benefit.","Imagine you are Barack Obama, and you realise - yes, when you were campaigning you were saying: spying on people without a warrant is a problem, but then you realise: you can read Angela Merkel's text messages. Why bother calling her and asking her opinion, when you can just read her mind by breaking the law? It sounds like a joke, but it is a very seductive thing. Secrecy is perhaps the most corrupting of all government powers, because it takes public officials and divorces them from accountability to the public.","When we look at the case of Trump, who is perhaps the worst of politicians, we see the same dynamic occurring. This is a president who said the CIA is the enemy, it's like Nazi Germany, they're listening to his phone calls, and all of these other things, some claims which are true, some claims which are absolutely not. A few months later, he is authorizing major powers for these same agencies that he has called his enemies.","And this gets to the central crux of your question, which is: can any president oppose this? The answer is certainly. The president has to have some familiarity going in with the fact that this pitch is going to be made, that they are going to try to scare him or her into compliance. The president has to be willing to stand strongly on line and say: 'I was elected to represent the interests of the American people, and if you're not willing to respect the constitution and our rights, I will disband your agency, and create a new one'. I think they can definitely be forced into compliance, because these officials fear prison, just like every one of us.\"","How do you look at the increasing relationships between corporate power like Amazon and the intelligence agencies in our democracies?","\"These are the companies that enable the mass surveillance abuses that were revealed in 2013. One of the very first programs, the PRISM program, I was talking about how companies were opening their private data silos. Everything Facebook knows, everything Google knows, everything Amazon knows, and the government would say 'what do you have on this person?' And these companies would provide it, in many cases beyond what the law required\".","They denied that, when your files were published...","\"Initially they said: 'we don't know about this kind of stuff, this program, we've never heard of it\", then they said 'Oh we do this, but it's through a process and the government asks us a question', but that was the whole point. These companies have data about you that they own, it's exclusively on their servers, and they're taking copies from their servers and providing them directly to government.","The point here is the intelligence agencies are powerful, but even they have limits. What they can see, what they can hear, what they can spy on, who they can recruit, who they can pay. Amazon, or Facebook or Microsoft, or Google, they too have limits. They have an extraordinary amount of information, but they only have what they have. But if the government can force these companies to work for them, or simply get these companies to work for them, now the government can do what Facebook and Google cannot. Google can only look in its own silo. The government can look in Facebook's silo, Google's silo, and everyone else's\".","How do you reply to those critics who attack you for \"only\" exposing the US mass surveillance and saying that the Chinese and the Russian surveillance complexes are no less threatening?","\"This is an easy one: I am not Chinese, I am not Russian, I didn't work for the Chinese secret services or Russian secret services, I worked for the US ones, so of course my information would be about the US\".","Critics say we should also expose the Russians and the Chinese...","\"Yes, if I could, I would. We need more Chinese whistleblowers, we need more Russian whistleblowers, and unfortunately that becomes more difficult to make that happen when the United States is itself setting a precedent that whistleblowers get persecuted and attacked, rather than protected\".","How do you see this serious diplomatic crisis between the UK and Russia?\n\"I haven't followed it that closely, but the idea that political violence is being used in any form is reprehensible, it needs to be condemned. If the UK allegations are correct, poisoning people, particularly people who are long out of their service, and in a different country, is contemptible\".","However, one wonders how these alleged Russian operatives can move around in a country where there is the powerful GCHQ.\n\" You know, that's not my area of expertise, I didn't work with assassinations\".","How is a typical day in the life of Edward Snowden, provided that there is a typical day?\n\"When I came forward and I started speaking out, it became more than just a job, it became part of my identity. It's not something you put away after working hours. Sometimes I'll be up until 6 o'clock in the morning working on something, writing something, talking to someone, giving a speech, and it's challenging, but at the same time it's very rewarding, because I can feel good about what I'm doing now, I can go to sleep at night proud of the things that I did during the day, and that's something that people at the NSA can't say\".","You said that your personal battle was not to burn down the NSA or the CIA, but rather to give the public a chance to decide where the line should be when it comes to surveillance. However, it is very likely that the NSA and the CIA want to burn you down. Do you think you will ever be able to travel the world again as a free man?\n\"I hope so, but ultimately it doesn't matter. I'm the least important part of the story. I was the mechanism of these revelations, but not the main point of it. I could be hit by a bus tomorrow, I could end up in jail tomorrow, it would certainly be a sad thing for me and I hope other people would be disappointed as well, but at the end of the day what happens to one of us is much less important than what happens to all of us. And because of that, I don't really worry about tomorrow, I can be satisfied with today\".","What would you suggest to young and talented people who want to do the right thing?\n\"Question power. I don't want people to trust me, I want people to doubt me, but I want them to take that experience and apply that to the real powers of society, not just isolated, exiled whistleblowers. Think about politicians, business leaders, the people who shape your society. Shouldn't it be that the ones who wield the most power in society are the ones who are held to the highest standard of behaviour?","And look at the way the system works in your country, around you today, and ask if in fact the most powerful people in society are being held to the highest standards, or if you see cases where if the ordinary person breaks the smallest law, they're going to jail, but if the most powerful people in society are engaged in criminal activity on the grandest scales, they can simply apologize and face no consequences. If that is the case, think about what you can do to fix that. The first step is always to question if this is the way things should be, and if it's not, it's time to change it\"."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

I’m confident that social media is a cancer on our private lives and a source of derangement in our politics. I take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections, and that they’ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data. I take a certain mordant pleasure in watching Mark Zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late-Obama-era liberalism.","But the liberal establishment’s fixation on Facebook’s 2016 sins — first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the Trump campaign or its appendages — still feels like a classic example of blaming something new because it’s new when it’s the old thing that mattered more. Or of blaming something new because you thought that “new” meant “good,” that the use of social-media data by campaigns would always help tech-savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals — and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the Trump era a reality.","No doubt all the activity on Facebook and the apparent use of Facebook’s data had some impact, somewhere, on Trump’s surprise victory. But the media format that really made him president, the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited, wasn’t Zuckerberg’s unreal kingdom; it wasn’t even the Twitter platform where Trump struts and frets and rages daily. It was that old pre-internet standby, broadcast and cable television, and especially TV news.","Start with the fake news that laid the foundation for Trump’s presidential campaign — not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your Facebook feed, but the sort broadcast in prime time by NBC, under the label of reality TV. Yes, as media sophisticates we’re all supposed to know that “reality” means “fake,” but in the beginning nobody marketed “The Apprentice” that way; across most of its run you saw a much-bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed, week after week and season after season, as a titan of industry, the for-serious greatest businessman in the world.","Where did so many people originally get the idea that Trump was the right guy to fix our manifestly broken government? Not from Russian bots or targeted social media ad buys, but from a prime-time show that sold itself as real, and sold him as a business genius. Forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders; forget white nationalists and birthers: The core Trump demographic might just have been Republicans who watched “The Apprentice,” who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them.","That was step one in the Trump hack of television media. Step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign. Yes, his fame also boosted him on social media, but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds; with television news there were actual human beings, charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic-minded actors when it suits them, making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to Donald Trump’s rallies, outrages, feuds and personal attacks.","Nothing that Cambridge Analytica did to help the Trump campaign target swing voters (and there’s reason to think it didn’t do as much as it claimed) had anything remotely like the impact of this #alwaysTrump tsunami, which probably added up to more than $2 billion in effective advertising for his campaign during the primary season, a flood that drowned all of his rivals’ pathetic tens of millions. And as cynical as I believe the lords of Silicon Valley to be, the more important cynicism in 2016 belonged to those television execs who were fine with enabling the wild Trumpian takeover of the G.O.P., because after all Republicans deserved it and Hillary was sure to beat him in the end.","Except that she didn’t beat him, in part because he also exploited the polarization that cable news, in particular, is designed to feed. In 2016 this polarization didn’t just mean that Fox became steadily more pro-Trump as he dispatched his G.O.P. rivals; it also meant that a network like CNN, which thrives on Team Red vs. Team Blue conflict, felt compelled to turn airtime over to Trump surrogates like Jeffrey Lord and Corey Lewandowski and Kayleigh McEnany because their regular stable of conservative commentators (I was one of them) simply wasn’t pro-Trump enough.","The depth and breadth of Trump skepticism among right-wing pundits was a pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office. But especially once he won the nomination this skepticism was often filtered out of cable coverage, because the important thing was to maintain the partisan shouting-match model. This in turn encouraged a sense that this was just a typical right-versus-left election, in which you should vote for Trump if you usually voted for Republicans … and in the end that’s what most G.O.P. voters did.","My own CNN experiences were positive; I admire the many fine journalists who work in television news. But it was clear enough being in that orbit in 2016, as it should be clear to anyone who watched Trump’s larger relationship to his television coverage, that the business model of our news channels both assumes and heightens polarization, and that it was ripe for exploitation by a demagogue who was also a celebrity.","It’s also clear — as the economists Levi Boxell, Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro wrote in these pages late last year — that among older white Americans, the core demographic where first the primaries and then the general election were decided, television still far outstrips the internet as the most important source of news. And indeed, the three economists noted, for all the talk about Breitbart’s influence and Russian meddling and dark web advertising, Trump only improved on Mitt Romney’s showing among Americans who don’t use the internet, and he “actually lost support among internet-using voters.” In a sense, you could argue, all those tweets mattered mainly because they kept being quoted on TV.","Which is not to say that the current freakout over Facebook doesn’t make a certain kind of sense. Beyond the psychological satisfaction of weaving the often-genuinely-sinister side of Silicon Valley into stolen-election theories, there’s a strategic wisdom to the center-left establishment’s focus on the internet.","What Trump did will be hard for a future demagogue to imitate: The generations who get their information from newscasts are dying out, the web is taking over at an accelerating pace and in the long run there is more to be gained in going after Mark Zuckerberg than in pillorying Jeff Zucker. And pillorying Fox’s hosts only helps their brand: the big tech companies regard themselves as part of the liberal cultural complex, so they’re vulnerable to progressive bullying and shaming; not so Sean Hannity, whose stalwart support for Trump was and remains vastly more important than any online stratagem.","In the end, as Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote recently for National Review, one implicit goal of the Facebook freakout is to ensure that “conservatives and populists will not be allowed to use the same tools as Democrats and liberals again, or at least not use them effectively.” If the trauma of Trump’s victory turns social-media gatekeepers into more aggressive and self-conscious stewards of the liberal consensus, the current freakout will have more than served its political purpose.","But like the television channels whose programming choices did far more than Facebook to make Donald Trump president, it won’t have served the truth."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

The auditors were in Cambridge Analytica’s offices on Monday night but left at the request of the British authorities.","The Information Commissioner can currently impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds but will gain the power to fine an organisation up to 4 percent of its global turnover when new data protection legislation comes into force in May.","The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","“This story comes on the back of increasing scrutiny and societal unease with FB’s potential impact on kids as well as increasing concerns around the power of mega cap Internet names, setting the stage for deeper investigation,” Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note, keeping his “buy” rating on Facebook stock.","Walmsley said he was worried “about how scrutiny could ultimately impact Facebook’s ability to gather and deploy data for ad targeting, which has been critical to ad efficacy and budget growth”.","The company said last month it had 1.4 billion active daily users, up 14 percent from a year earlier. But the number of daily users in the United States and Canada fell for the first time in its history, dipping in the company’s home market by 700,000 from a quarter earlier to 184 million.","Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu in Washington; editing by David Stamp; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and David Stamp"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Now, 28-year-old Christopher Wylie goes on the record to discuss his role in hijacking the profiles of millions of Facebook users in order to target the US electorate","The first time I met Christopher Wylie, he didn’t yet have pink hair. That comes later. As does his mission to rewind time. To put the genie back in the bottle.","By the time I met him in person, I’d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time. On the phone, he was clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling. A master storyteller. A politicker. A data science nerd.","Two months later, when he arrived in London from Canada, he was all those things in the flesh. And yet the flesh was impossibly young. He was 27 then (he’s 28 now), a fact that has always seemed glaringly at odds with what he has done. He may have played a pivotal role in the momentous political upheavals of 2016. At the very least, he played a consequential role. At 24, he came up with an idea that led to the foundation of a company called Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that went on to claim a major role in the Leave campaign for Britain’s EU membership referendum, and later became a key figure in digital operations during Donald Trump’s election campaign.","Or, as Wylie describes it, he was the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating “Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindfuck tool”.","In 2014, Steve Bannon – then executive chairman of the “alt-right” news network Breitbart – was Wylie’s boss. And Robert Mercer, the secretive US hedge-fund billionaire and Republican donor, was Cambridge Analytica’s investor. And the idea they bought into was to bring big data and social media to an established military methodology – “information operations” – then turn it on the US electorate.","It was Wylie who came up with that idea and oversaw its realisation. And it was Wylie who, last spring, became my source. In May 2017, I wrote an article headlined “The great British Brexit robbery”, which set out a skein of threads that linked Brexit to Trump to Russia. Wylie was one of a handful of individuals who provided the evidence behind it. I found him, via another Cambridge Analytica ex-employee, lying low in Canada: guilty, brooding, indignant, confused. “I haven’t talked about this to anyone,” he said at the time. And then he couldn’t stop talking.","By that time, Steve Bannon had become Trump’s chief strategist. Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, had won contracts with the US State Department and was pitching to the Pentagon, and Wylie was genuinely freaked out. “It’s insane,” he told me one night. “The company has created psychological profiles of 230 million Americans. And now they want to work with the Pentagon? It’s like Nixon on steroids.”","He ended up showing me a tranche of documents that laid out the secret workings behind Cambridge Analytica. And in the months following publication of my article in May,it was revealed that the company had “reached out” to WikiLeaks to help distribute Hillary Clinton’s stolen emails in 2016. And then we watched as it became a subject of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian collusion in the US election.","The Observer also received the first of three letters from Cambridge Analytica threatening to sue Guardian News and Media for defamation. We are still only just starting to understand the maelstrom of forces that came together to create the conditions for what Mueller confirmed last month was “information warfare”. But Wylie offers a unique, worm’s-eye view of the events of 2016. Of how Facebook was hijacked, repurposed to become a theatre of war: how it became a launchpad for what seems to be an extraordinary attack on the US’s democratic process.","Wylie oversaw what may have been the first critical breach. Aged 24, while studying for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting, he came up with a plan to harvest the Facebook profiles of millions of people in the US, and to use their private and personal information to create sophisticated psychological and political profiles. And then target them with political ads designed to work on their particular psychological makeup.","He hesitates. “I’ll point out that I assumed it was entirely legal and above board.”","Last month, Facebook’s UK director of policy, Simon Milner, told British MPs on a select committee inquiry into fake news, chaired by Conservative MP Damian Collins, that Cambridge Analytica did not have Facebook data. The official Hansard extract reads:","Christian Matheson (MP for Chester): “Have you ever passed any user information over to Cambridge Analytica or any of its associated companies?”","Simon Milner: “No.”","Matheson: “But they do hold a large chunk of Facebook’s user data, don’t they?”","Milner: “No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Two weeks later, on 27 February, as part of the same parliamentary inquiry, Rebecca Pow, MP for Taunton Deane, asked Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix: “Does any of the data come from Facebook?” Nix replied: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","And through it all, Wylie and I, plus a handful of editors and a small, international group of academics and researchers, have known that – at least in 2014 – that certainly wasn’t the case, because Wylie has the paper trail. In our first phone call, he told me he had the receipts, invoices, emails, legal letters – records that showed how, between June and August 2014, the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users had been harvested. Most damning of all, he had a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately.","Going public involves an enormous amount of risk. Wylie is breaking a non-disclosure agreement and risks being sued. He is breaking the confidence of Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer.","It’s taken a rollercoaster of a year to help get Wylie to a place where it’s possible for him to finally come forward. A year in which Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of investigations on both sides of the Atlantic – Robert Mueller’s in the US, and separate inquiries by the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK, both triggered in February 2017, after the Observer’s first article in this investigation.","It has been a year, too, in which Wylie has been trying his best to rewind – to undo events that he set in motion. Earlier this month, he submitted a dossier of evidence to the Information Commissioner’s Office and the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit. He is now in a position to go on the record: the data nerd who came in from the cold.","There are many points where this story could begin. One is in 2012, when Wylie was 21 and working for the Liberal Democrats in the UK, then in government as junior coalition partners. His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","Wylie grew up in British Columbia and as a teenager he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. He left school at 16 without a single qualification. Yet at 17, he was working in the office of the leader of the Canadian opposition; at 18, he went to learn all things data from Obama’s national director of targeting, which he then introduced to Canada for the Liberal party. At 19, he taught himself to code, and in 2010, age 20, he came to London to study law at the London School of Economics.","“Politics is like the mob, though,” he says. “You never really leave. I got a call from the Lib Dems. They wanted to upgrade their databases and voter targeting. So, I combined working for them with studying for my degree.”","Politics is also where he feels most comfortable. He hated school, but as an intern in the Canadian parliament he discovered a world where he could talk to adults and they would listen. He was the kid who did the internet stuff and within a year he was working for the leader of the opposition.","It showed these odd patterns. People who liked 'I hate Israel' on Facebook also tended to like KitKats","“He’s one of the brightest people you will ever meet,” a senior politician who’s known Wylie since he was 20 told me. “Sometimes that’s a blessing and sometimes a curse.”","Starting in 2007,Stillwell, while a student, had devised various apps for Facebook, one of which, a personality quiz called myPersonality, had gone viral. Users were scored on “big five” personality traits – Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism – and in exchange, 40% of them consented to give him access to their Facebook profiles. Suddenly, there was a way of measuring personality traits across the population and correlating scores against Facebook “likes” across millions of people.","Examples, above and below, of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test. Respondents were asked: How important should this message be to all Americans?","The research was original, groundbreaking and had obvious possibilities. “They had a lot of approaches from the security services,” a member of the centre told me. “There was one called You Are What You Like and it was demonstrated to the intelligence services. And it showed these odd patterns; that, for example, people who liked ‘I hate Israel’ on Facebook also tended to like Nike shoes and KitKats.","“There are agencies that fund research on behalf of the intelligence services. And they were all over this research. That one was nicknamed Operation KitKat.”","The defence and military establishment were the first to see the potential of the research. Boeing, a major US defence contractor, funded Kosinski’s PhD and Darpa, the US government’s secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is cited in at least two academic papers supporting Kosinski’s work.","But when, in 2013, the first major paper was published, others saw this potential too, including Wylie. He had finished his degree and had started his PhD in fashion forecasting, and was thinking about the Lib Dems. It is fair to say that he didn’t have a clue what he was walking into.","“I wanted to know why the Lib Dems sucked at winning elections when they used to run the country up to the end of the 19th century,” Wylie explains. “And I began looking at consumer and demographic data to see what united Lib Dem voters, because apart from bits of Wales and the Shetlands it’s weird, disparate regions. And what I found is there were no strong correlations. There was no signal in the data.","“And then I came across a paper about how personality traits could be a precursor to political behaviour, and it suddenly made sense. Liberalism is correlated with high openness and low conscientiousness, and when you think of Lib Dems they’re absent-minded professors and hippies. They’re the early adopters… they’re highly open to new ideas. And it just clicked all of a sudden.”","Here was a way for the party to identify potential new voters. The only problem was that the Lib Dems weren’t interested.","“I did this presentation at which I told them they would lose half their 57 seats, and they were like: ‘Why are you so pessimistic?’ They actually lost all but eight of their seats, FYI.”","Another Lib Dem connection introduced Wylie to a company called SCL Group, one of whose subsidiaries, SCL Elections, would go on to create Cambridge Analytica (an incorporated venture between SCL Elections and Robert Mercer, funded by the latter). For all intents and purposes, SCL/Cambridge Analytica are one and the same.","Alexander Nix, then CEO of SCL Elections, made Wylie an offer he couldn’t resist. “He said: ‘We’ll give you total freedom. Experiment. Come and test out all your crazy ideas.’”","Another example of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test.","In the history of bad ideas, this turned out to be one of the worst. The job was research director across the SCL group, a private contractor that has both defence and elections operations. Its defence arm was a contractor to the UK’s Ministry of Defence and the US’s Department of Defense, among others. Its expertise was in “psychological operations” – or psyops –changing people’s minds not through persuasion but through “informational dominance”, a set of techniques that includes rumour, disinformation and fake news.","SCL Elections had used a similar suite of tools in more than 200 elections around the world, mostly in undeveloped democracies that Wylie would come to realise were unequipped to defend themselves.","Wylie holds a British Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visa – a UK work visa given to just 200 people a year. He was working inside government (with the Lib Dems) as a political strategist with advanced data science skills. But no one, least of all him, could have predicted what came next. When he turned up at SCL’s offices in Mayfair, he had no clue that he was walking into the middle of a nexus of defence and intelligence projects, private contractors and cutting-edge cyberweaponry.","“The thing I think about all the time is, what if I’d taken a job at Deloitte instead? They offered me one. I just think if I’d taken literally any other job, Cambridge Analytica wouldn’t exist. You have no idea how much I brood on this.”","A few months later, in autumn 2013, Wylie met Steve Bannon. At the time, he was editor-in-chief of Breitbart, which he had brought to Britain to support his friend Nigel Farage in his mission to take Britain out of the European Union.","What was he like?","“Smart,” says Wylie. “Interesting. Really interested in ideas. He’s the only straight man I’ve ever talked to about intersectional feminist theory. He saw its relevance straightaway to the oppressions that conservative, young white men feel.”","Wylie meeting Bannon was the moment petrol was poured on a flickering flame. Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time. He had a theory to prove. And at the time, this was a purely intellectual problem. Politics was like fashion, he told Bannon.","If you do not respect the agency of people, anything you do after that point is not conducive to democracy","Christopher Wylie","“[Bannon] got it immediately. He believes in the whole Andrew Breitbart doctrine that politics is downstream from culture, so to change politics you need to change culture. And fashion trends are a useful proxy for that. Trump is like a pair of Uggs, or Crocs, basically. So how do you get from people thinking ‘Ugh. Totally ugly’ to the moment when everyone is wearing them? That was the inflection point he was looking for.”","But Wylie wasn’t just talking about fashion. He had recently been exposed to a new discipline: “information operations”, which ranks alongside land, sea, air and space in the US military’s doctrine of the “five-dimensional battle space”. His brief ranged across the SCL Group – the British government has paid SCL to conduct counter-extremism operations in the Middle East, and the US Department of Defense has contracted it to work in Afghanistan.","I tell him that another former employee described the firm as “MI6 for hire”, and I’d never quite understood it.","“It’s like dirty MI6 because you’re not constrained. There’s no having to go to a judge to apply for permission. It’s normal for a ‘market research company’ to amass data on domestic populations. And if you’re working in some country and there’s an auxiliary benefit to a current client with aligned interests, well that’s just a bonus.”","When I ask how Bannon even found SCL, Wylie tells me what sounds like a tall tale, though it’s one he can back up with an email about how Mark Block, a veteran Republican strategist, happened to sit next to a cyberwarfare expert for the US air force on a plane. “And the cyberwarfare guy is like, ‘Oh, you should meet SCL. They do cyberwarfare for elections.’”","It was Bannon who took this idea to the Mercers: Robert Mercer – the co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who used his billions to pursue a rightwing agenda, donating to Republican causes and supporting Republican candidates – and his daughter Rebekah.","Nix and Wylie flew to New York to meet the Mercers in Rebekah’s Manhattan apartment.","“She loved me. She was like, ‘Oh we need more of your type on our side!’”","Your type?","“The gays. She loved the gays. So did Steve [Bannon]. He saw us as early adopters. He figured, if you can get the gays on board, everyone else will follow. It’s why he was so into the whole Milo [Yiannopoulos] thing.”","Robert Mercer was a pioneer in AI and machine translation. He helped invent algorithmic trading – which replaced hedge fund managers with computer programs – and he listened to Wylie’s pitch. It was for a new kind of political message-targeting based on an influential and groundbreaking 2014 paper researched at Cambridge’s Psychometrics Centre, called: “Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans”.","“In politics, the money man is usually the dumbest person in the room. Whereas it’s the opposite way around with Mercer,” says Wylie. “He said very little, but he really listened. He wanted to understand the science. And he wanted proof that it worked.”","And to do that, Wylie needed data.","How Cambridge Analytica acquired the data has been the subject of internal reviews at Cambridge University, of many news articles and much speculation and rumour.","When Nix was interviewed by MPs last month, Damian Collins asked him:","“Does any of your data come from Global Science Research company?”","Nix: “GSR?”","Collins: “Yes.”","Nix: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Collins: “They have not supplied you with data or information?”","Nix: “No.”","Collins: “Your datasets are not based on information you have received from them?”","Nix: “No.”","Collins: “At all?”","Nix: “At all.”","The problem with Nix’s response to Collins is that Wylie has a copy of an executed contract, dated 4 June 2014, which confirms that SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with a company called Global Science Research (GSR), owned by Cambridge-based academic Aleksandr Kogan, specifically premised on the harvesting and processing of Facebook data, so that it could be matched to personality traits and voter rolls.","He has receipts showing that Cambridge Analytica spent $7m to amass this data, about $1m of it with GSR. He has the bank records and wire transfers. Emails reveal Wylie first negotiated with Michal Kosinski, one of the co-authors of the original myPersonality research paper, to use the myPersonality database. But when negotiations broke down, another psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, offered a solution that many of his colleagues considered unethical. He offered to replicate Kosinski and Stillwell’s research and cut them out of the deal. For Wylie it seemed a perfect solution. “Kosinski was asking for $500,000 for the IP but Kogan said he could replicate it and just harvest his own set of data.” (Kosinski says the fee was to fund further research.)","An unethical solution? Dr Aleksandr Kogan Photograph: alex kogan","Kogan then set up GSR to do the work, and proposed to Wylie they use the data to set up an interdisciplinary institute working across the social sciences. “What happened to that idea,” I ask Wylie. “It never happened. I don’t know why. That’s one of the things that upsets me the most.”","It was Bannon’s interest in culture as war that ignited Wylie’s intellectual concept. But it was Robert Mercer’s millions that created a firestorm. Kogan was able to throw money at the hard problem of acquiring personal data: he advertised for people who were willing to be paid to take a personality quiz on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics. At the end of which Kogan’s app, called thisismydigitallife, gave him permission to access their Facebook profiles. And not just theirs, but their friends’ too. On average, each “seeder” – the people who had taken the personality test, around 320,000 in total – unwittingly gave access to at least 160 other people’s profiles, none of whom would have known or had reason to suspect.","What the email correspondence between Cambridge Analytica employees and Kogan shows is that Kogan had collected millions of profiles in a matter of weeks. But neither Wylie nor anyone else at Cambridge Analytica had checked that it was legal. It certainly wasn’t authorised. Kogan did have permission to pull Facebook data, but for academic purposes only. What’s more, under British data protection laws, it’s illegal for personal data to be sold to a third party without consent.","“Facebook could see it was happening,” says Wylie. “Their security protocols were triggered because Kogan’s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use. So they were like, ‘Fine’.”","Kogan maintains that everything he did was legal and he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Cambridge Analytica had its data. This was the foundation of everything it did next – how it extracted psychological insights from the “seeders” and then built an algorithm to profile millions more.","For more than a year, the reporting around what Cambridge Analytica did or didn’t do for Trump has revolved around the question of “psychographics”, but Wylie points out: “Everything was built on the back of that data. The models, the algorithm. Everything. Why wouldn’t you use it in your biggest campaign ever?”","In December 2015, the Guardian’s Harry Davies published the first report about Cambridge Analytica acquiring Facebook data and using it to support Ted Cruz in his campaign to be the US Republican candidate. But it wasn’t until many months later that Facebook took action. And then, all they did was write a letter. In August 2016, shortly before the US election, and two years after the breach took place, Facebook’s lawyers wrote to Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and told him the data had been illicitly obtained and that “GSR was not authorised to share or sell it”. They said it must be deleted immediately.","“I already had. But literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,” says Wylie. “Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.”","There were multiple copies of it. It had been emailed in unencrypted files.","Cambridge Analytica rejected all allegations the Observer put to them.","Dr Kogan – who later changed his name to Dr Spectre, but has subsequently changed it back to Dr Kogan – is still a faculty member at Cambridge University, a senior research associate. But what his fellow academics didn’t know until Kogan revealed it in emails to the Observer (although Cambridge University says that Kogan told the head of the psychology department), is that he is also an associate professor at St Petersburg University. Further research revealed that he’s received grants from the Russian government to research “Stress, health and psychological wellbeing in social networks”. The opportunity came about on a trip to the city to visit friends and family, he said.","There are other dramatic documents in Wylie’s stash, including a pitch made by Cambridge Analytica to Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil producer. In an email dated 17 July 2014, about the US presidential primaries, Nix wrote to Wylie: “We have been asked to write a memo to Lukoil (the Russian oil and gas company) to explain to them how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business. Nix said that “they understand behavioural microtargeting in the context of elections” but that they were “failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers”. The work, he said, would be “shared with the CEO of the business”, a former Soviet oil minister and associate of Putin, Vagit Alekperov.","“It didn’t make any sense to me,” says Wylie. “I didn’t understand either the email or the pitch presentation we did. Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?”","Mueller’s investigation traces the first stages of the Russian operation to disrupt the 2016 US election back to 2014, when the Russian state made what appears to be its first concerted efforts to harness the power of America’s social media platforms, including Facebook. And it was in late summer of the same year that Cambridge Analytica presented the Russian oil company with an outline of its datasets, capabilities and methodology. The presentation had little to do with “consumers”. Instead, documents show it focused on election disruption techniques. The first slide illustrates how a “rumour campaign” spread fear in the 2007 Nigerian election – in which the company worked – by spreading the idea that the “election would be rigged”. The final slide, branded with Lukoil’s logo and that of SCL Group and SCL Elections, headlines its “deliverables”: “psychographic messaging”.","Robert Mercer with his daughter Rebekah. Photograph: Sean Zanni/Getty Images","Lukoil is a private company, but its CEO, Alekperov, answers to Putin, and it’s been used as a vehicle of Russian influence in Europe and elsewhere – including in the Czech Republic, where in 2016 it was revealed that an adviser to the strongly pro-Russian Czech president was being paid by the company.","When I asked Bill Browder – an Anglo-American businessman who is leading a global campaign for a Magnitsky Act to enforce sanctions against Russian individuals – what he made of it, he said: “Everyone in Russia is subordinate to Putin. One should be highly suspicious of any Russian company pitching anything outside its normal business activities.”","Last month, Nix told MPs on the parliamentary committee investigating fake news: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do not have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”","There’s no evidence that Cambridge Analytica ever did any work for Lukoil. What these documents show, though, is that in 2014 one of Russia’s biggest companies was fully briefed on: Facebook, microtargeting, data, election disruption.","Cambridge Analytica is “Chris’s Frankenstein”, says a friend of his. “He created it. It’s his data Frankenmonster. And now he’s trying to put it right.”","Only once has Wylie made the case of pointing out that he was 24 at the time. But he was. He thrilled to the intellectual possibilities of it. He didn’t think of the consequences. And I wonder how much he’s processed his own role or responsibility in it. Instead, he’s determined to go on the record and undo this thing he has created.","Because the past few months have been like watching a tornado gathering force. And when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something – his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead – it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold. Dealing with someone trained in information warfare has its own particular challenges, and his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great BritishBake Off. And not everyone’s a fan. Any number of ex-colleagues – even the ones who love him – call him “Machiavellian”. Another described the screaming matches he and Nix would have.","“What do your parents make of your decision to come forward?” I ask him.","“They get it. My dad sent me a cartoon today, which had two characters hanging off a cliff, and the first one’s saying ‘Hang in there.’ And the other is like: ‘Fuck you.’”","Which are you?","“Probably both.”","What isn’t in doubt is what a long, fraught journey it has been to get to this stage. And how fearless he is.","After many months, I learn the terrible, dark backstory that throws some light on his determination, and which he discusses candidly. At six, while at school, Wylie was abused by a mentally unstable person. The school tried to cover it up, blaming his parents, and a long court battle followed. Wylie’s childhood and school career never recovered. His parents – his father is a doctor and his mother is a psychiatrist – were wonderful, he says. “But they knew the trajectory of people who are put in that situation, so I think it was particularly difficult for them, because they had a deeper understanding of what that does to a person long term.”","Facebook has denied and denied this. It has failed in its duties to respect the law","Paul-Olivier Dehaye","He says he grew up listening to psychologists discuss him in the third person, and, aged 14, he successfully sued the British Columbia Ministry of Education and forced it to change its inclusion policies around bullying. What I observe now is how much he loves the law, lawyers, precision, order. I come to think of his pink hair as a false-flag operation. What he cannot tolerate is bullying.","Is what Cambridge Analytica does akin to bullying?","“I think it’s worse than bullying,” Wylie says. “Because people don’t necessarily know it’s being done to them. At least bullying respects the agency of people because they know. So it’s worse, because if you do not respect the agency of people, anything that you’re doing after that point is not conducive to a democracy. And fundamentally, information warfare is not conducive to democracy.”","Russia, Facebook, Trump, Mercer, Bannon, Brexit. Every one of these threads runs through Cambridge Analytica. Even in the past few weeks, it seems as if the understanding of Facebook’s role has broadened and deepened. The Mueller indictments were part of that, but Paul-Olivier Dehaye – a data expert and academic based in Switzerland, who published some of the first research into Cambridge Analytica’s processes– says it’s become increasingly apparent that Facebook is “abusive by design”. If there is evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, it will be in the platform’s data flows, he says. And Wylie’s revelations only move it on again.","“Facebook has denied and denied and denied this,” Dehaye says when told of the Observer’s new evidence. “It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law. It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","The great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijacked","Read more","Facebook denies that the data transfer was a breach. In addition, a spokesperson said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules. Both Aleksandr Kogan as well as the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Millions of people’s personal information was stolen and used to target them in ways they wouldn’t have seen, and couldn’t have known about, by a mercenary outfit, Cambridge Analytica, who, Wylie says, “would work for anyone”. Who would pitch to Russian oil companies. Would they subvert elections abroad on behalf of foreign governments?","It occurs to me to ask Wylie this one night.","“Yes.”","Nato or non-Nato?","“Either. I mean they’re mercenaries. They’ll work for pretty much anyone who pays.”","It’s an incredible revelation. It also encapsulates all of the problems of outsourcing – at a global scale, with added cyberweapons. And in the middle of it all are the public – our intimate family connections, our “likes”, our crumbs of personal data, all sucked into a swirling black hole that’s expanding and growing and is now owned by a politically motivated billionaire.","The Facebook data is out in the wild. And for all Wylie’s efforts, there’s no turning the clock back.","Tamsin Shaw, a philosophy professor at New York University, and the author of a recent New York Review of Books article on cyberwar and the Silicon Valley economy, told me that she’d pointed to the possibility of private contractors obtaining cyberweapons that had at least been in part funded by US defence.","She calls Wylie’s disclosures “wild” and points out that “the whole Facebook project” has only been allowed to become as vast and powerful as it has because of the US national security establishment.","“It’s a form of very deep but soft power that’s been seen as an asset for the US. Russia has been so explicit about this, paying for the ads in roubles and so on. It’s making this point, isn’t it? That Silicon Valley is a US national security asset that they’ve turned on itself.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

(Pedro Nunes/Reuters)","Related Stories","The Massachusetts attorney general said on Saturday her office was launching an investigation after reports that Cambridge Analytica had harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook users in developing techniques to support U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.","\"Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. We are launching an investigation,\" Maura Healey said on Twitter in a post that linked to a New York Times report on the issue.","The Times and London's Observer, which cited former Cambridge Analytica employees, associates and documents, said the data breach was one of the largest in the history of Facebook Inc.","'We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.'- Christopher Wylie, whistleblower","Facebook on Friday said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica after finding data privacy policies had been violated.","The Observer said Cambridge Analytica used the data, taken without authorization in early 2014, to build a software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","The paper quoted Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, Canadian data analytics expert Christopher Wylie, who worked with an academic at Cambridge University to obtain the data, as saying the system could profile individual voters to target them with personalized political advertisements.","The more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential U.S. voters, at the time, the paper said.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,\" the Observer quoted Wylie as saying.","Cambridge Analytica still holds private data: NYTimes","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through Kogan's company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers' Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the paper said.","It said Facebook's platform policy allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said on Friday it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and its parent group Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared.","A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said GSR \"was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the U.K. Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","Online political advertising 'Wild West'","\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" he said.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" the spokesperson said.","He added that \"no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement, which was attributed to the social network's deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal.","\"We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behaviour,\" Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims. In a Twitter post, Facebook's Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports \"important and powerful,\" but said it was \"incorrect to call this a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\"","\"We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,\" he said.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it \"provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.\"","Trump campaign manager declines comment","Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, declined to comment on Friday. In past interviews with Reuters, Parscale has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign, and that the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was \"more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West\" and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","The suspension means Cambridge Analytica and SCL cannot buy ads on the world's largest social media network or administer pages belonging to clients, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, said in a Twitter post.","To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts.

Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report.","Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of Kogan's data was used in its 2016 election work for the \"avoidance of doubt.\"","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","The Facebook blog post, written by deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Trump's general-election campaign.","Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","\"The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\"","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.","A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.","The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.","Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized. Flynn is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference after pleading guilty to a felony charge.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nix said Assange denied the request, which came after Assange had said publicly that he had the emails. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.","Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling.","Revelations that Cambridge Analytica misused social media data could also be of interest to Mueller's investigation. While much of the thrust of special counsel's investigation has been tightly held, Mueller has requested that the firm turn over the emails of any employees who worked on the campaign, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last year.","Mueller is also looking at the role Wikileaks played in acquiring and making public the stolen Clinton campaign emails.","Never miss a story","Choose the plan that's right for you.\nDigital access or digital and print delivery."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Sure, Google’s ad network and Facebook’s News Feed/“Related Stories” algorithms amplify the emotional spread of misinformation, and social media naturally turn up the volume of political outrage. At the same time, I think journalists, researchers and data geeks should first look into the factors that are actually 1) producing the content and 2) driving the online traffic.","⚗Welcome to the Micro-Propaganda Machine","There’s a vast network of dubious “news” sites. Most are simple in design, and many appear to be made from the same web templates. These sites have created an ecosystem of real-time propaganda: they include viral hoax engines that can instantly shape public opinion through mass “reaction” to serious political topics and news events. This network is triggered on-demand to spread false, hyper-biased, and politically-loaded information.","In my previous post, I found that only ~60% of incoming traffic from a sample of leading “fake” and hyper-biased news sites seemed to be coming out of Facebook and Twitter. The remaining ~40% of web traffic was organic — coming from direct website visits, P2P shares, text/instant messaging, subscription e-newsletters, RSS, and search engines. Again: Less than 0.1% of the traffic to the sites I looked at came from display advertising or (known) paidsearchcontent.","My guess was that this network — the #MPM — of small “fake” and hyper-biased sites has been pushing traffic through links — and helping to inject this content into platforms like Facebook and Twitter. This effort was likely ramped up around the time the 🇺🇸#Election2016 primaries concluded, as well as any time a new political issue (involving email servers, groin grabbing, immigrants, etc.) takes place.","For the purposes of looking directly at what some have termed the “alt-right” political propaganda machine, I kept the sources in this analysis restricted to sites that have been 🗯⚠️publicly called out by internet users and listed by editors on the following verification sites: Snopes, Fake News Watch, Real or Satire, and Media Bias Fact Check.","Due to the sensitivity of this type of research, I feel complete transparency is key: Below is my list of the 117 sites I scraped and indexed in my #MCM election data project.","I crawled 🕷 every website on the list and extracted URLs one “level” deep. This scraping effort, given the relatively basic structure of these template-based websites, represents the majority of links on these sites (735,263 of them, to be exact).","🔂After a couple of hours, my scraping/indexing effort resulted more than 11,033 webpages, and 735,263 hyperlinks. Out of this data set, there were 80,587 hyperlink connections —aka shared URLS — across the 117 fake news websites.","Where does the #MPM point? What does it look like?","I looked for patterns in the shared links to find what places these fake news websites seem to be linking to, as well as their most common inbound link destinations, and the structure of how the #MCM was embedded across the wider 🇺🇸#Election2016 mediascape.","{After exporting the dataset (.gexf file), I sorted out the news “network” at the widest scale using an open source tool, GEPHI, and the ForceAtlas2 algorithm. Any website with at least two shared URLs (links) to them from the 117 sites on my list above appear in my #MPM network graph. There were just over 2000 sites in the network, and all data obtained was publicly available and appeared on the websites as of 17-Nov-2016}","Legend","The circle, or “node,” size on the following graph(s) is proportional (1–100 scale) to the number of shared hyperlinks that link into the site from the 117 website sample. The colors are sorted according to actor type.","#ICYMI","The following website data map, called a network graph, can be used reflect on #Election2016. It can help us discover:","The 🔝 influential sites that are central to information flow in the micro-propaganda network. From a social influence perspective, this data helps us find which sites drive conspiracy/misinformation/“fake” and “viral” content/propaganda online, and see how each is positioned on the internet and;","🔎Where and ⚗how this micro-propaganda machine tends to coordinate its resources. By displaying network-level patterns in how these sites are linked to one another, and showing how dense their connections (“edges”) are, we can visualize how this propaganda network is positioned “around” other actors, such as the “lamestream media” and “mainstream” social media platforms.","{What this data cannot show — at least, directly — is why these links exist or exactly when they were established. To put it simply, this map can show us the frequency and direction of “fake news” relationships, but can’t display the complete nature of the connections.}","This originally small project turned out to be an unexpectedly rich data capture — I could probably write about it for weeks. However, there are several fascinating themes that are displayed in this fringe-right propaganda network (see embed above for high resolution version). I’m publishing this now, since I feel it can help solve the #Election2016 equation.","YouTube’s dominance was expected, as many sites — “left-wing,” “right-wing,” or otherwise —post links to videos, creator channels and documentary-style “educational” material. Again, the 🌀LARGEST circles are the domains that are linked to the MOST by the propaganda engine. I’ll come back to the separate “webpages” at the end — there’s a countdown of the “top ten” individual links.","🛰2. Mainstream Media Are Mostly “Surrounded”","If you look at the graph closely, you’ll see they basically surround most of the mainstream media, including the largest 🎨“liberal” media, on the network. This includes national newspapers like the New York Times, The Washington Post, and even “right-wing” media such as Breitbart.com, the Dailycaller.com, and theNational Review.","Zoomed out perspective of #MPM network","The sites in the fake news and hyper-biased #MCM network have a very small “node” size — this means they are linking out heavily to mainstream media, social networks, and informational resources (most of which are in the “center” of the network), but not many sites in their peer group are sending links back.","The most influential sites line the 🌐periphery of the virtual propaganda network. You can see (image above) that many of the sites have a large flood of red hyperlinks flowing outward — some of these are in the thousands. For the purposes of this analysis, the red lines (each representing a different URL) “matter” most when they are headed towards the large nodes in the center of the network.","🎥3. Content Sharing and Media Hosting","The #MCM network displays a high number of links to content creation and web asset-hosting services (Wordpress.com, Statcounter.com, WP.com, etc.). These likely are shared to help the website users produce content and measure the impact of their audiences. The zoomed-in views (see images below) also suggest that these fake news sites use social platforms to share as well as coordinate through hyperlinks:","Significant numbers of hyperlinks are directed towards “sharing resources” on social media platforms","I’ll explain: If you look around the largest picture of the network (see first image), you can see the 🤖🤖🤖 coordinating effect of individual page hyperlinks. In the next image, you can see how many larger red nodes have smaller “interest clusters” — these appear to consist primarily of Twitter accounts, public Facebook pages, and other miscellaneous issue-based websites:","🎛4. Material and Digital Production Tools and eCommerce","In the next images (see below), there are an interesting number of links pointing to 👕consumer goods/commerce sites and ✂️digitalproduction tools. These include CafePress (t-shirts), Feedburner (RSS news), and Addthis.com (social sharing scripts).","This could mean that the propaganda network may be use these resources internally to spread — as well as generate some income — off of politically-themed news events and political debates. These links might be pushed into other locations on the internet, especially social platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Oddly, Amazon.com (see first graph, above) is also a top inbound link destination in the #MCM network. Further analysis is needed to uncover the type of content/resources all of these links point towards.","✅5. Fact Checking and Knowledge Editing","Next, the #MCM network links heavily to a major poll site, Gallup, and crowdsourced fact-checking and reference resources —most notably Wikipedia, Reddit, and Wikimedia. Snopes and other fake news verification sites are in the “liberal” side of the network at the top-middle right (see the first large graph).","The Four Corners of the #MSM","This is a preliminary data analysis, but beyond the specifics — like all network graphs — I feel the the widest picture of the network (again, the first full-size network graph) is intriguing. The network is clearly split into several ideological regions: The ⬅️far left and ↖️top left areas have the most “alt right” and “hard right” actors; the ⏫middle top region shows a strong religious base as well as a strong anti-Islamic component.","The ➡️far right side seems to be most 🎨“liberal,” and this side adds increasing numbers of governmental actors as it joins the harder-right religious conservative actors around the 🔼mid-to-upper center of the network. The ↙️bottom left region is primarily influential social media accounts, and the ↕️bottom center involves many international media outlets; similar to the upper half of the network, the lower half starts to pick up more university websites, environmental action and policy sites, and tech-oriented actors (e.g., EFF.com) as you move towards the ↘️bottom right.","The unofficial top ten #MCM link countdown","To wrap up this post, I’m listing the most-shared non-domain links in the “micro-propaganda machine” network. This means the most commonly shared links (i.e., InDegree) out of the 80,587 URLs that link to individual pages (i.e., not the NYT front page, Facebook.com, Google email/searches).","📚Bonus: The large Amazon.com inbound link presence in the network appears to be through the fake news sites’ Amazon seller affiliate links. These links are for getting kickbacks on merchandise sold (books, magazines, etc.) from ads on their site, or through Amazon recommendations in original posts or book recommendations.","I translated the top individual Amazon.com link in the network through an affiliate code-matching website. It’s a subscription (through Amazon) to a conservative magazine:","This is just a 🔭glimpse of publicly available data related to the election. This post has a fair portion of what I found, but I do hope to look into the data more. I also plan to look at the exact opposite bias — meaning switching this network graph around and coding the “left-wing” websites to see what sorts of linking patterns play into 🎨liberal micro-propaganda from the recent election.","I hope this glimpse into a set of focused medium data offers another path to move forward, since I see little point in arguing about complex, ever-changing 🔢algorithms.","I also believe that platform-specific social network metrics are often more trouble than they are worth. For one, we don’t know how these proprietary measurement systems work for a reason: they involve💰multibillion-dollar business models and 🔐confidential IP. While Facebook’sengagement metrics are interesting to think about, they don’t really offer us much in the way of pinpointing the propaganda, misinformation, and viral/hoax clickbait that really shaped the election.","I’ve tried to be 📝transparent in this analysis. I do expect to take some heat for the selective focus, which involves previously uncharted political data-journalistic waters. But I feel at this point ALL research involving fake news is a move in the right direction.","As I recently argued, turning around and blaming Facebook, Twitter, and Google for our 🌍 widespread social and cultural problems isn’t the best place to start. I mean, why look at the result when you can look at the 🎯 problem? That’s exactly what I’ve tried to do here."],"isopubdate":"2016-11-18"}

{"originalurl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency","title":"The Reclusive Hedge-Fund Tycoon Behind the Trump Presidency | The New Yorker","text":["Last month, when President Donald Trump toured a Boeing aircraft plant in North Charleston, South Carolina, he saw a familiar face in the crowd that greeted him: Patrick Caddell, a former Democratic political operative and pollster who, for forty-five years, has been prodding insurgent Presidential candidates to attack the Washington establishment. Caddell, who lives in Charleston, is perhaps best known for helping Jimmy Carter win the 1976 Presidential race. He is also remembered for having collaborated with his friend Warren Beatty on the 1998 satire “Bulworth.” In that film, a kamikaze candidate abandons the usual talking points and excoriates both the major political parties and the media; voters love his unconventionality, and he becomes improbably popular. If the plot sounds familiar, there’s a reason: in recent years, Caddell has offered political advice to Trump. He has not worked directly for the President, but at least as far back as 2013 he has been a contractor for one of Trump’s biggest financial backers: Robert Mercer, a reclusive Long Island hedge-fund manager, who has become a major force behind the Trump Presidency.","During the past decade, Mercer, who is seventy, has funded an array of political projects that helped pave the way for Trump’s rise. Among these efforts was public-opinion research, conducted by Caddell, showing that political conditions in America were increasingly ripe for an outsider candidate to take the White House. Caddell told me that Mercer “is a libertarian—he despises the Republican establishment,” and added, “He thinks that the leaders are corrupt crooks, and that they’ve ruined the country.”","Trump greeted Caddell warmly in North Charleston, and after giving a speech he conferred privately with him, in an area reserved for V.I.P.s and for White House officials, including Stephen Bannon, the President’s top strategist, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. Caddell is well known to this inner circle. He first met Trump in the eighties. (“People said he was just a clown,” Caddell said. “But I’ve learned that you should always pay attention to successful ‘clowns.’ ”) Caddell shared the research he did for Mercer with Trump and others in the campaign, including Bannon, with whom he has partnered on numerous projects.","The White House declined to divulge what Trump and Caddell discussed in North Charleston, as did Caddell. But that afternoon Trump issued perhaps the most incendiary statement of his Presidency: a tweet calling the news media “the enemy of the American people.” The proclamation alarmed liberals and conservatives alike. William McRaven, the retired Navy admiral who commanded the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, called Trump’s statement a “threat to democracy.” The President is known for tweeting impulsively, but in this case his words weren’t spontaneous: they clearly echoed the thinking of Caddell, Bannon, and Mercer. In 2012, Caddell gave a speech at a conference sponsored by Accuracy in Media, a conservative watchdog group, in which he called the media “the enemy of the American people.” That declaration was promoted by Breitbart News, a platform for the pro-Trump alt-right, of which Bannon was the executive chairman, before joining the Trump Administration. One of the main stakeholders in Breitbart News is Mercer.","Mercer is the co-C.E.O. of Renaissance Technologies, which is among the most profitable hedge funds in the country. A brilliant computer scientist, he helped transform the financial industry through the innovative use of trading algorithms. But he has never given an interview explaining his political views. Although Mercer has recently become an object of media speculation, Trevor Potter, the president of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group, who formerly served as the chairman of the Federal Election Commission, said, “I have no idea what his political views are—they’re unknown, not just to the public but also to most people who’ve been active in politics for the past thirty years.” Potter, a Republican, sees Mercer as emblematic of a major shift in American politics that has occurred since 2010, when the Supreme Court made a controversial ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. That ruling, and several subsequent ones, removed virtually all limits on how much money corporations and nonprofit groups can spend on federal elections, and how much individuals can give to political-action committees. Since then, power has tilted away from the two main political parties and toward a tiny group of rich mega-donors.","Private money has long played a big role in American elections. When there were limits on how much a single donor could give, however, it was much harder for an individual to have a decisive impact. Now, Potter said, “a single billionaire can write an eight-figure check and put not just their thumb but their whole hand on the scale—and we often have no idea who they are.” He continued, “Suddenly, a random billionaire can change politics and public policy—to sweep everything else off the table—even if they don’t speak publicly, and even if there’s almost no public awareness of his or her views.”","Through a spokesman, Mercer declined to discuss his role in launching Trump. People who know him say that he is painfully awkward socially, and rarely speaks. “He can barely look you in the eye when he talks,” an acquaintance said. “It’s probably helpful to be highly introverted when getting lost in code, but in politics you have to talk to people, in order to find out how the real world works.” In 2010, when the Wall Street Journal wrote about Mercer assuming a top role at Renaissance, he issued a terse statement: “I’m happy going through my life without saying anything to anybody.” According to the paper, he once told a colleague that he preferred the company of cats to humans.","Several people who have worked with Mercer believe that, despite his oddities, he has had surprising success in aligning the Republican Party, and consequently America, with his personal beliefs, and is now uniquely positioned to exert influence over the Trump Administration. In February, David Magerman, a senior employee at Renaissance, spoke out about what he regards as Mercer’s worrisome influence. Magerman, a Democrat who is a strong supporter of Jewish causes, took particular issue with Mercer’s empowerment of the alt-right, which has included anti-Semitic and white-supremacist voices. Magerman shared his concerns with Mercer, and the conversation escalated into an argument. Magerman told colleagues about it, and, according to an account in the Wall Street Journal, Mercer called Magerman and said, “I hear you’re going around saying I’m a white supremacist. That’s ridiculous.” Magerman insisted to Mercer that he hadn’t used those words, but added, “If what you’re doing is harming the country, then you have to stop.” After the Journal story appeared, Magerman, who has worked at Renaissance for twenty years, was suspended for thirty days. Undaunted, he published an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer, accusing Mercer of “effectively buying shares in the candidate.” He warned, “Robert Mercer now owns a sizeable share of the United States Presidency.”","Nick Patterson, a former senior Renaissance employee who is now a computational biologist at the Broad Institute, agrees that Mercer’s influence has been huge. “Bob has used his money very effectively,” he said. “He’s not the first person in history to use money in politics, but in my view Trump wouldn’t be President if not for Bob. It doesn’t get much more effective than that.”","Patterson said that his relationship with Mercer has always been collegial. In 1993, Patterson, at that time a Renaissance executive, recruited Mercer from I.B.M., and they worked together for the next eight years. But Patterson doesn’t share Mercer’s libertarian views, or what he regards as his susceptibility to conspiracy theories about Bill and Hillary Clinton. During Bill Clinton’s Presidency, Patterson recalled, Mercer insisted at a staff luncheon that Clinton had participated in a secret drug-running scheme with the C.I.A. The plot supposedly operated out of an airport in Mena, Arkansas. “Bob told me he believed that the Clintons were involved in murders connected to it,” Patterson said. Two other sources told me that, in recent years, they had heard Mercer claim that the Clintons have had opponents murdered.","The Mena story is one of several dark fantasies put forth in the nineties by The American Spectator, an archconservative magazine. According to Patterson, Mercer read the publication at the time. David Brock, a former Spectator writer who is now a liberal activist, told me that the alleged Mena conspiracy was based on a single dubious source, and was easily disproved by flight records. “It’s extremely telling that Mercer would believe that,” Brock said. “It says something about his conspiratorial frame of mind, and the fringe circle he was in. We at the Spectator called them Clinton Crazies.”","Patterson also recalled Mercer arguing that, during the Gulf War, the U.S. should simply have taken Iraq’s oil, “since it was there.” Trump, too, has said that the U.S. should have “kept the oil.” Expropriating another country’s natural resources is a violation of international law. Another onetime senior employee at Renaissance recalls hearing Mercer downplay the dangers posed by nuclear war. Mercer, speaking of the atomic bombs that the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, argued that, outside of the immediate blast zones, the radiation actually made Japanese citizens healthier. The National Academy of Sciences has found no evidence to support this notion. Nevertheless, according to the onetime employee, Mercer, who is a proponent of nuclear power, “was very excited about the idea, and felt that it meant nuclear accidents weren’t such a big deal.”","Mercer strongly supported the nomination of Jeff Sessions to be Trump’s Attorney General. Many civil-rights groups opposed the nomination, pointing out that Sessions has in the past expressed racist views. Mercer, for his part, has argued that the Civil Rights Act, in 1964, was a major mistake. According to the onetime Renaissance employee, Mercer has asserted repeatedly that African-Americans were better off economically before the civil-rights movement. (Few scholars agree.) He has also said that the problem of racism in America is exaggerated. The source said that, not long ago, he heard Mercer proclaim that there are no white racists in America today, only black racists. (Mercer, meanwhile, has supported a super PAC, Black Americans for a Better Future, whose goal is to “get more Blacks involved in the Republican Party.”)","“Most people at Renaissance didn’t challenge him” about politics, Patterson said. But Patterson clashed with him over climate change; Mercer said that concerns about it were overblown. After Patterson shared with him a scientific paper on the subject, Mercer and his brother, Randall, who also worked at the hedge fund, sent him a paper by a scientist named Arthur Robinson, who is a biochemist, not a climate expert. “It looked like a scientific paper, but it was completely loaded with selective and biased information,” Patterson recalled. The paper argued that, if climate change were real, future generations would “enjoy an Earth with far more plant and animal life.” Robinson owns a sheep ranch in Cave Junction, Oregon, and on the property he runs a laboratory that he calls the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine. Mercer helps subsidize Robinson’s various projects, which include an effort to forestall aging.","Patterson sent Mercer a note calling Robinson’s arguments “completely false.” He never heard back. “I think if you studied Bob’s views of what the ideal state would look like, you’d find that, basically, he wants a system where the state just gets out of the way,” Patterson said. “Climate change poses a problem for that world view, because markets can’t solve it on their own.”","Magerman told the Wall Street Journal that Mercer’s political opinions “show contempt for the social safety net that he doesn’t need, but many Americans do.” He also said that Mercer wants the U.S. government to be “shrunk down to the size of a pinhead.” Several former colleagues of Mercer’s said that his views are akin to Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand. Magerman told me, “Bob believes that human beings have no inherent value other than how much money they make. A cat has value, he’s said, because it provides pleasure to humans. But if someone is on welfare they have negative value. If he earns a thousand times more than a schoolteacher, then he’s a thousand times more valuable.” Magerman added, “He thinks society is upside down—that government helps the weak people get strong, and makes the strong people weak by taking their money away, through taxes.” He said that this mind-set was typical of “instant billionaires” in finance, who “have no stake in society,” unlike the industrialists of the past, who “built real things.”","Another former high-level Renaissance employee said, “Bob thinks the less government the better. He’s happy if people don’t trust the government. And if the President’s a bozo? He’s fine with that. He wants it to all fall down.”","The 2016 Presidential election posed a challenge for someone with Mercer’s ideology. Multiple sources described him as animated mainly by hatred of Hillary Clinton. But Mercer also distrusted the Republican leadership. After the candidate he initially supported, Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, dropped out of the race, Mercer sought a disruptive figure who could upend both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Patterson told me that Mercer seems to have applied “a very Renaissance Technologies way of thinking” to politics: “He probably estimated the probability of Trump winning, and when it wasn’t very high he said to himself, ‘O.K., what has to happen in order for this twenty-per-cent thing to occur?’ It’s like playing a card game when you haven’t got a very good hand.”","Mercer, as it happens, is a superb poker player, and his political gamble appears to have paid off. Institutional Investor has called it “Robert Mercer’s Trade of the Century.”","In the 2016 campaign, Mercer gave $22.5 million in disclosed donations to Republican candidates and to political-action committees. Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster who worked for the Trump campaign, said that Mercer had “catapulted to the top of the heap of right-of-center power brokers.” It’s worth noting that several other wealthy financiers, including Democrats such as Thomas Steyer and Donald Sussman, gave even more money to campaigns. (One of the top Democratic donors was James Simons, the retired founder of Renaissance Technologies.) Nevertheless, Mercer’s political efforts stand apart. Adopting the strategy of Charles and David Koch, the billionaire libertarians, Mercer enlarged his impact exponentially by combining short-term campaign spending with long-term ideological investments. He poured millions of dollars into Breitbart News, and—in what David Magerman has called “an extreme example of modern entrepreneurial philanthropy”—made donations to dozens of politically tinged organizations.","Like many wealthy families, the Mercers have a private foundation. At first, the Mercer Family Foundation, which was established in 2004, had an endowment of only half a million dollars, and most of its grants went to medical research and conventional charities. But by 2008, under the supervision of Mercer’s ardently conservative daughter, Rebekah, the foundation began giving millions of dollars to interconnected nonprofit groups, several of which played crucial roles in propagating attacks on Hillary Clinton. By 2015, the most recent year for which federal tax records are available, the foundation had grown into a $24.5-million operation that gave large sums to ultraconservative organizations.","On top of this nonprofit spending, Mercer invested in private businesses. He put ten million dollars into Breitbart News, which was conceived as a conservative counterweight to the Huffington Post. The Web site freely mixes right-wing political commentary with juvenile rants and racist innuendo; under Bannon’s direction, the editors introduced a rubric called Black Crime. The site played a key role in undermining Hillary Clinton; by tracking which negative stories about her got the most clicks and “likes,” the editors helped identify which story lines and phrases were the most potent weapons against her. Breitbart News has been a remarkable success: according to ComScore, a company that measures online traffic, the site attracted 19.2 million unique visitors in October.","Mercer also invested some five million dollars in Cambridge Analytica, a firm that mines online data to reach and influence potential voters. The company has said that it uses secret psychological methods to pinpoint which messages are the most persuasive to individual online viewers. The firm, which is the American affiliate of Strategic Communication Laboratories, in London, has worked for candidates whom Mercer has backed, including Trump. It also reportedly worked on the Brexit campaign, in the United Kingdom.","Alexander Nix, the C.E.O. of the firm, says that it has created “profiles”—consisting of several thousand data points—for two hundred and twenty million Americans. In promotional materials, S.C.L. has claimed to know how to use such data to wage both psychological and political warfare. “Persuading somebody to vote a certain way,” Nix has said publicly, “is really very similar to persuading 14- to 25-year-old boys in Indonesia to not join Al Qaeda.” Some critics suggest that, at this point, Cambridge Analytica’s self-promotion exceeds its effectiveness. But Jonathan Albright, an assistant professor of communications at Elon University, in North Carolina, recently published a paper, on Medium, calling Cambridge Analytica a “propaganda machine.”","As important as Mercer’s business investments is his hiring of advisers. Years before he started supporting Trump, he began funding several conservative activists, including Steve Bannon; as far back as 2012, Bannon was the Mercers’ de-facto political adviser. Some people who have observed the Mercers’ political evolution worry that Bannon has become a Svengali to the whole family, exploiting its political inexperience and tapping its fortune to further his own ambitions. It was Bannon who urged the Mercers to invest in a data-analytics firm. He also encouraged the investment in Breitbart News, which was made through Gravitas Maximus, L.L.C., a front group that once had the same Long Island address as Renaissance Technologies. In an interview, Bannon praised the Mercers’ strategic approach: “The Mercers laid the groundwork for the Trump revolution. Irrefutably, when you look at donors during the past four years, they have had the single biggest impact of anybody, including the Kochs.”","Last summer, Bannon and some other activists whom the Mercers have supported—including David Bossie, who initiated the Citizens United lawsuit—came together to rescue Trump’s wobbly campaign. Sam Nunberg, an early Trump adviser who watched Mercer’s group take over, said, “Mercer was smart. He invested in the right people.”","Bannon and Rebekah Mercer have become particularly close political partners. Last month, when Bannon denounced “the corporatist, globalist media” at the Conservative Political Action Conference, in his first public appearance since entering the White House, Rebekah Mercer was part of his entourage. Bannon supports some initiatives, such as a major infrastructure program, that are anathema to libertarians such as Robert Mercer. But the Wall Street Journal has described Bannon joking and swearing on the deck of the Mercers’ yacht, the Sea Owl, as if he were a member of the family. Bannon assured me that the Mercers, despite all their luxuries, are “the most middle-class people you will ever meet.”","Robert and Diana Mercer brought up their three daughters in a modest home near I.B.M.’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center, in Westchester County. The girls attended public schools, and Robert and Diana worried about paying three college tuitions. According to Donna D’Andraia, a family friend, Diana was a PTA member and a “tiger mom” who “made sure that the girls did all the right things—they were in the honor society, and stayed out of trouble.” D’Andraia recalled Diana saying that Robert was brilliant, but D’Andraia found it hard to tell, because “he was very quiet—he didn’t talk to anybody.”","The eldest Mercer daughter, Jennifer, or Jenji, attended Stanford. Rebekah, the middle daughter, enrolled at Cornell and then transferred to Stanford. Majoring in biology and math, she graduated in 1996; a few years later, she got an M.A., in operations research. The youngest daughter, Heather Sue, “was the spitfire,” D’Andraia recalled. When Heather Sue was a junior in high school, she tried out to be a place kicker on the football team. She made it, and, after enrolling at Duke University, she joined its varsity squad. When the Duke coach refused to treat her as the equal of her male teammates, she sued the school for gender discrimination, and won two million dollars in damages. Ron Santavicca, Heather Sue’s high-school coach, described the Mercers, who still invite him to their Christmas parties, as “the salt of the earth.” He added, “The whole family is very determined. When they have a mission, they go after it.”","In 1993, when Nick Patterson mailed Robert Mercer a job offer from Renaissance, Mercer threw it in the trash: he’d never heard of the hedge fund. At the time, Mercer was part of a team pioneering the use of computers to translate languages. I.B.M. considered the project a bit of a luxury, and didn’t see its potential, though the work laid the foundation for Google Translate and Apple’s Siri. But Mercer and his main partner, Peter Brown, found the project exciting, and had the satisfaction of showing up experts in the field, who had dismissed their statistical approach to translating languages as impractical. Instead of trying to teach a computer linguistic rules, Mercer and Brown downloaded enormous quantities of dual-language documents—including Canadian parliamentary records—and created code that analyzed the data and detected patterns, enabling predictions of probable translations. According to a former I.B.M. colleague, Mercer was obsessive, and at one point took six months off to type into a computer every entry in a Spanish-English dictionary. Sebastian Mallaby, in his 2010 book on the hedge-fund industry, “More Money Than God,” reports that Mercer’s boss at I.B.M. once jokingly called him an “automaton.”","In 2014, Mercer accepted a lifetime-achievement award from the Association for Computational Linguistics. In a speech at the ceremony, Mercer, who grew up in New Mexico, said that he had a “jaundiced view” of government. While in college, he had worked on a military base in Albuquerque, and he had showed his superiors how to run certain computer programs a hundred times faster; instead of saving time and money, the bureaucrats ran a hundred times more equations. He concluded that the goal of government officials was “not so much to get answers as to consume the computer budget.” Mercer’s colleagues say that he views the government as arrogant and inefficient, and believes that individuals need to be self-sufficient, and should not receive aid from the state. Yet, when I.B.M. failed to offer adequate support for Mercer and Brown’s translation project, they secured additional funding from DARPA, the secretive Pentagon program. Despite Mercer’s disdain for “big government,” this funding was essential to his early success.","Meanwhile, Patterson kept asking Mercer and Brown to join Renaissance. He thought that their technique of extracting patterns from huge amounts of data could be applied to the pile of numbers generated daily by the global trade in stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies. The patterns could generate predictive financial models that would give traders a decisive edge.","In the spring of 1993, Mercer experienced two devastating losses: his mother was killed, in a car crash, and his father, a biologist, died six weeks later. With life’s precariousness made painfully clear, and with tuition bills mounting, he decided to leave I.B.M. for a higher-paying job at Renaissance. Brown made the leap, too.","Renaissance was founded by James Simons, a legendary mathematician, in 1982. Simons had run the math department at Stony Brook University, on Long Island, and the hedge fund took a uniquely academic approach to high finance. Andrew Lo, a finance professor at M.I.T.’s Sloan School of Management, has described it as “the commercial version of the Manhattan Project.” Intensely secretive and filled with people with Ph.D.s, it has been sensationally profitable. Its Medallion Fund, which is open only to the firm’s three hundred or so employees, has averaged returns of almost eighty per cent a year, before fees. Bloomberg News has called the Medallion Fund “perhaps the world’s greatest moneymaking machine.”","In “More Money Than God,” Mallaby, who interviewed Mercer, describes his temperament as that of an “icy cold poker player”; Mercer told him that he could not recall ever having had a nightmare. But Mercer warms up when talking about computers. In the 2014 speech, he recalled the first time he used one, at a science camp, and likened the experience to falling in love. He also spoke of the government lab in New Mexico. “I loved the solitude of the computer lab late at night,” he said. “I loved the air-conditioned smell of the place. I loved the sound of the disks whirring and the printers clacking.” The speech lasted forty minutes—“more than I typically talk in a month,” he noted.","Patterson told me that when Mercer arrived at Renaissance the firm’s equities division was lagging behind other areas, such as futures trading. Mercer and Brown applied their algorithms to equities trading. “It took several years,” Patterson recalled, but the equities group eventually accounted for the largest share of the Medallion Fund’s profits. Mercer and Brown’s code took into account nearly every conceivable predictor of market swings; their secret formula became so valuable that, when a pair of Russian mathematicians at the firm tried to take the recipe elsewhere, the company initiated legal action against them.","Renaissance’s profits were further enhanced by a controversial tax maneuver, which became the subject of a 2014 Senate inquiry. According to Senate investigators, Renaissance had presented countless short-term trades as long-term ones, improperly avoiding some $6.8 billion in taxes. The Senate didn’t allege criminality, but it concluded that Renaissance had committed “abuses.” The I.R.S. demanded payment. (Renaissance defended its practices, and the matter remains contested, leaving a very sensitive material issue pending before the Trump Administration.)","The Medallion Fund made Renaissance employees among the wealthiest people in the country. Forbes estimates that Simons, who has the biggest share, is worth eighteen billion dollars. In 2009, Simons stepped aside, to focus on philanthropy, and named Mercer and Brown co-C.E.O.s. Institutional Investor’s Alpha estimates that, in 2015, Mercer earned a hundred and thirty-five million dollars at Renaissance.","Mercer’s fortune has allowed him and his family to indulge their wildest material fantasies. He and Diana moved into a waterfront estate in Head of the Harbor, a seaside community on Long Island, and called the property Owl’s Nest. Mercer, a gun enthusiast, built a private pistol range there. (He is also a part owner of Centre Firearms, a company that claims to have the country’s largest private cache of machine guns, as well as a weapon that Arnold Schwarzenegger wielded in “The Terminator.”) At Owl’s Nest, Mercer has installed a $2.7-million model-train set in his basement; trains chug through a miniature landscape half the size of a basketball court. The toy train attracted unwanted tabloid headlines, such as “Boo-hoo over 2m Choo-choo,” after Mercer sued the manufacturer for overcharging him. (The case was settled.)","Mercer retains a domestic staff that includes a butler and a physician; both accompany him whenever he travels. But this, too, has sparked bad publicity. In 2013, three members of the household staff sued to recover back wages, claiming that Mercer had failed to pay overtime, as promised, and that he had deducted pay as punishment for poor work. One infraction that Mercer cited as a “demerit” was a failure to replace shampoo bottles that were two-thirds empty. This suit, too, was settled.","Mercer has bought several spectacular yachts, including the Sea Owl, which is two hundred and three feet long. A 2013 photo shows the gates of the Tower Bridge, in London, raised high to allow it to proceed up the Thames. The Sea Owl has a crew of eighteen, and features a hand-carved “tree” that twists through four levels of decks. Designed, in part, as a place where the extended Mercer family can gather, the yacht has many fanciful and didactic touches for the Mercer grandchildren, such as frescoes that allude to the discoveries of Darwin and Newton. There’s a self-playing Steinway, a spa pool, and an elevator.","Mercer has given major credit to his family for the yacht’s special details, telling Boat International that they are “endowed with both exceptionally good taste and exceptionally strong opinions.” The Mercer daughters are indeed forceful. When a Manhattan bakery that the sisters loved, Ruby et Violette, threatened to close, depriving the Mercers of their favorite cookies, they bought it. In a Fox News interview, Heather Sue recalled telling the others, “We are going to buy a bakery!” The Mercers still own the business, although it is now online-only.","After graduating from Duke, Heather Sue began competing in high-stakes poker tournaments; she is admired on the circuit for her cool manner. When Mercer insisted that Heather Sue take a security guard with her, Santavicca said, “they became friends, then they became whatever, and now they’re married, with two beautiful daughters.”","Jenji has a law degree from Georgetown, but she has pursued an interest in horses instead. In 2008, the Mercers bought a horse farm in Wellington, Florida, for $5.9 million. Jenji and Diana regularly attend the Winter Equestrian Festival, in Palm Beach. They are investors in an equestrian center in North Carolina, and have announced plans to open one in Colorado. Diana is also listed as the owner of Equinimity, a horse stable in Florida. According to the stable’s Web site, it specializes in Equine Facilitated Learning, a system that teaches “non-verbal leadership and interpersonal communication skills through non-predatory horse-inspired wisdom.”","Rebekah worked for a few years at Renaissance after graduating from Stanford. A former colleague recalls her as smart but haughty. In 2003, she married a Frenchman, Sylvain Mirochnikoff, who is a managing director of Morgan Stanley. They had four children and bought a twenty-eight-million-dollar property—six apartments joined together—at Trump Place, on the Upper West Side. Now forty-three, she is divorcing Mirochnikoff. She homeschools the children, but in recent years she has become consumed by politics. “She is the First Lady of the alt-right,” Christopher Ruddy, the owner of the conservative outlet Newsmax Media, said. “She’s respected in conservative circles, and clearly Trump has embraced her in a big way.”","Amity Shlaes, the conservative writer and the chair of the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, where Rebekah Mercer is a trustee, told me, “In the dull crowds of policy, the Mercers are enchanting firecrackers.” She likened the Mercer sisters to the Schuylers—the high-spirited, witty sisters made famous by the musical “Hamilton.” Shlaes went on, “The Mercers have strong values, they’re kind of funny, and they’re really bright. Their brains are almost too strong.” Rebekah, she noted, supports several think tanks, but grows tired of talk; she “is into action.”","After the Citizens United decision, in 2010, the Mercers were among the first people to take advantage of the opportunity to spend more money on politics. In Oregon, they quietly gave money to a super PAC—an independent campaign-related group that could now take unlimited donations. In New York, reporters discovered that Robert Mercer was the sole donor behind a million-dollar advertising campaign attacking what it described as a plan to build a “Ground Zero Mosque” in Manhattan. The proposed building was neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero. The ads, which were meant to boost a Conservative Party candidate for governor, were condemned as Islamophobic.","In Oregon, the Mercers gave six hundred and forty thousand dollars to a group that attacked Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, with a barrage of negative ads during the final weeks of his 2010 reëlection campaign. This effort also failed—it didn’t help when DeFazio announced that a New York hedge-fund manager and his daughter were meddling in Oregon politics.","Press accounts speculated that Robert Mercer may have targeted DeFazio because DeFazio had proposed a tax on a type of high-volume stock trade that Renaissance frequently made. But several associates of Mercer’s say that the truth is stranger. DeFazio’s Republican opponent was Arthur Robinson—the biochemist, sheep rancher, and climate-change denialist. The Mercers became his devoted supporters after reading Access to Energy, an offbeat scientific newsletter that he writes. The family has given at least $1.6 million in donations to Robinson’s Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine. Some of the money was used to buy freezers in which Robinson is storing some fourteen thousand samples of human urine. Robinson has said that, by studying the urine, he will find new ways of extending the human life span.","Robinson holds a degree in chemistry from Caltech, but his work is not respected in most scientific circles. (The Oregon senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, has called Robinson an “extremist kook.”) Robinson appears to be the source of Robert Mercer’s sanguine view of nuclear radiation: in 1986, Robinson co-authored a book suggesting that the vast majority of Americans would survive “an all-out atomic attack on the United States.” Robinson’s institute dismisses climate change as a “false religion.” A petition that he organized in 1998 to oppose the Kyoto Protocol, claiming to represent thirty thousand scientists skeptical of global warming, has been criticized as deceptive. The National Academy of Sciences has warned that the petition never appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, though it is printed in “a format that is nearly identical to that of scientific articles.” The petition, however, still circulates online: in the past year, it was the most shared item about climate change on Facebook.","Robinson, who calls himself a “Jesus-plus-nothing-else” Christian, has become a hero to the religious right for homeschooling his six children. Robert and Rebekah Mercer have praised a curriculum that Robinson sells. (An advertisement for it casts doubt on evolution: “No demonstration has ever been made of the process of ‘spontaneous origin of life.’ ”) Robinson has said that the “socialist” agenda of public schools is “evil” and represents “a form of child abuse.”","Even though 2010 was a successful election year for Republicans, the candidates that the Mercers had supported in Oregon and New York both lost decisively. Their investments had achieved nothing. Wealthy political donors sometimes make easy marks for campaign operatives. Patrick Caddell, the former pollster, told me, “These people who get so rich by running businesses get so taken in when it comes to politics. They’re just sheep. The consultants suck it out of them. A lot of them are surrounded by palace guards, but that’s not true of the Mercers.”","By 2011, the Mercers had joined forces with Charles and David Koch, who own Koch Industries, and who have run a powerful political machine for decades. The Mercers attended the Kochs’ semiannual seminars, which provide a structure for right-wing millionaires looking for effective ways to channel their cash. The Mercers admired the savviness of the Kochs’ plan, which called for attendees to pool their contributions in a fund run by Koch operatives. The fund would strategically deploy the money in races across the country, although, at the time, the Kochs’ chief aim was to defeat Barack Obama in 2012. The Kochs will not reveal the identities of their donors, or the size of contributions, but the Mercers reportedly began giving at least a million dollars a year to the Kochs’ fund. Eventually, they contributed more than twenty-five million.","The Mercers also joined the Council for National Policy, which the Times has described as a “little-known club of a few hundred of the most powerful conservatives in the country.” The Mercers have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars. The group swears participants to secrecy. But a leaked 2014 roster revealed that it included many people who promoted anti-Clinton conspiracy stories, including Joseph Farah, the editor of WorldNetDaily. The group also brought the Mercers into the orbit of two people who have become key figures in the Trump White House: Kellyanne Conway, who was on the group’s executive committee, and Steve Bannon.","In 2011, the Mercers met Andrew Breitbart, the founder of the fiery news outlet that bears his name, at a conference organized by the Club for Growth, a conservative group. They were so impressed by him that they became interested in investing in his operation. Breitbart, a gleefully offensive provocateur, was the temperamental opposite of Robert Mercer. (In 2010, Breitbart told this magazine, “I like to call someone a raving cunt every now and then, when it’s appropriate, for effect.”) Nevertheless, the Mercers were attracted to Breitbart’s vision of “taking back the culture” by building a media enterprise that could wage information warfare against the mainstream press, empowering what Breitbart called “the silenced majority.”","Breitbart soon introduced the Mercers to Steve Bannon. For a while, Breitbart News operated out of office space that Bannon owned in Santa Monica. A Harvard Business School graduate, Bannon had worked at Goldman Sachs, but he eventually left the world of finance and began making political films. His ambition, apparently, was to become the Michael Moore of the right. In the aughts, he directed polemical documentaries, among them “Fire from the Heartland” and “District of Corruption.” A former associate of Bannon’s in California recalls him as a strategic thinker who was adept at manipulating the media. A voracious reader, he was quick and charming, but, according to the former associate, he had a chip on his shoulder about class. He often spoke of having grown up in a blue-collar Irish Catholic family in Richmond, Virginia, and of having served as a naval officer when he was young. Bannon seemed to feel excluded from the social world of Wall Street peers who had attended prep schools. He had left Goldman Sachs, in 1990, without making partner, and, though he was well off, he had missed out on the gigantic profits that partners had made when the company went public, in 1999.","In 2011, Bannon drafted a business plan for the Mercers that called for them to invest ten million dollars in Breitbart News, in exchange for a large stake. At the time, the Breitbart site was little more than a collection of blogs. The Mercers signed the deal that June, and one of its provisions placed Bannon on the company’s board.","Nine months later, Andrew Breitbart died, at forty-three, of a heart attack, and Bannon became the site’s executive chairman, overseeing its content. The Mercers, meanwhile, became Bannon’s principal patrons. The Washington Post recently published a house-rental lease that Bannon signed in 2013, on which he said that his salary at Breitbart News was seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.","Under Bannon’s leadership, the Web site expanded dramatically, adding a fleet of full-time writers. It became a new force on the right, boosting extreme insurgents against the G.O.P. establishment, such as David Brat, who, in 2014, took the seat of Eric Cantor, the Virginia congressman. But it also provided a public forum for previously shunned white-nationalist, sexist, and racist voices. One pundit hired by Bannon was Milo Yiannopoulos, who specialized in puerile insults. (He recently resigned from the site, after a video of him lewdly defending pederasty went viral.)","In 2014, Bannon began hosting a radio show that often featured Patrick Caddell, who effectively had been banished by Democratic Party leaders after years of tempestuous campaigns and fallings-out. On the air, Caddell floated dark theories about Hillary Clinton, and often sounded a lot like Bannon, describing “economic nationalism” as the driving force in American politics. Under Barack Obama, he said, America had turned into a “banana republic.”","By 2016, Breitbart News claims, it had the most shared political content on Facebook, giving the Mercers a platform that no other conservative donors could match. Rebekah Mercer is highly engaged with Breitbart’s content. An insider there said, “She reads every story, and calls when there are grammatical errors or typos.” Though she doesn’t dictate a political line to the editors, she often points out areas of coverage that she thinks require more attention. Her views about the Washington establishment, including the Republican leadership, are scathing. “She was at the avant-garde of shuttering both political parties,” the insider at Breitbart said. “She went a long way toward the redefinition of American politics.”","The Mercers’ investment in Breitbart enabled Bannon to promote anti-establishment politicians whom the mainstream media dismissed, including Trump. In 2011, David Bossie, the head of the conservative group Citizens United, introduced Trump to Bannon; at the time, Trump was thinking about running against Obama. Bannon and Trump met at Trump Tower and discussed a possible campaign. Trump decided against the idea, but the two kept in touch, and Bannon gave Trump admiring coverage. Bannon noticed that, when Trump spoke to crowds, people were electrified. Bannon began to think that Trump might be “the one” who could shake up American politics.","“Breitbart gave Trump a big role,” Sam Nunberg, the aide who worked on the early stages of Trump’s campaign, has said. “They gave us an outlet. No one else would. It allowed us to define our narrative and communicate our message. It really started with the birther thing”—Trump’s false claim that Obama was not born an American citizen—“and then immigration, and Iran. Trump was developing his message.” By 2013, Nunberg said, Trump, like others on Breitbart, was “hitting the establishment” by slamming the Republican leadership in Congress, including Paul Ryan. Nunberg added, “It wasn’t like Charlie Rose was asking us on.”","The Mercer Family Foundation kept expanding its political investments. Between 2011 and 2014, it gave nearly eleven million dollars to the Media Research Center, an advocacy group whose “sole mission,” according to its Web site, “is to expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left: the national news media.” The group’s founder, L. Brent Bozell III, is best known for his successful campaign to get CBS sanctioned for showing Janet Jackson’s bared breast during the 2004 Super Bowl broadcast. The Mercers have been among the M.R.C.’s biggest donors, and their money has allowed the group to revamp its news site, and it now claims to reach more than two hundred million Americans a week.","In 2012, the Mercer Family Foundation donated two million dollars to Citizens United, which had trafficked in Clinton hatred for years. During the Clinton Administration, David Bossie, the group’s leader, was a Republican congressional aide, and he was forced to resign after releasing misleading material about a Clinton associate. In 2008, Citizens United released a vitriolic film, “Hillary: The Movie.” Two years ago, after the group received an additional five hundred and fifty thousand dollars from the Mercers’ foundation, it filed a Freedom of Information Act request demanding access to Hillary Clinton’s State Department e-mails. When the e-mails were released, her Presidential campaign became mired in negative news stories.","Bannon has often collaborated with Bossie, producing half a dozen films with him. In 2012, Bossie suggested a new joint project: a movie that urged Democrats and independents to abandon Obama in the Presidential election. The film’s approach was influenced by polling work that Patrick Caddell had shared with Bannon. The data suggested that attacking Obama was counterproductive; it was more effective to express “disappointment” in him, by contrasting him with earlier Presidents.","Caddell and Bannon made an unholy alliance, but they had things in common: both men were Irish Catholic sons of the South, scourges to their respective parties, and prone to apocalyptic pronouncements. “We hit it off right away,” Caddell told me. “We’re both revolutionaries.” Bannon was excited by Caddell’s polling research, and he persuaded Citizens United to hire Caddell to convene focus groups of disillusioned Obama supporters. Many of these voters became the central figures of “The Hope & the Change,” an anti-Obama film that Bannon and Citizens United released during the 2012 Democratic National Convention. After Caddell saw the film, he pointed out to Bannon that its opening imitated that of “Triumph of the Will,” the 1935 ode to Hitler, made by the Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl. Bannon laughed and said, “You’re the only one that caught it!” In both films, a plane flies over a blighted land, as ominous music swells; then clouds in the sky part, auguring a new era. The disappointed voters in the film “seared into me,” Bannon said, the fact that middle-class Americans badly wanted change, and could be lured away from the Democratic Party if they felt that they had been conned.","In 2012, Citizens United’s foundation paid Bannon Strategic Advisors, a consultancy group founded by Bannon, three hundred thousand dollars for what it described to the I.R.S. as “fund-raising” services. Bossie told me that the tax filing must have been made in error: the payment was actually for Bannon’s “film development” work. Charitable groups are barred from spending tax-deductible contributions on partisan politics, yet, as Breitbart News noted at the time, “The Hope & the Change” was a “partisan” film “targeting Democrats” during an election year. Even so, the Mercers took a hefty tax deduction for their two-million-dollar donation to Citizens United.","Bossie told me that “the Mercers are very interested in films.” Indeed, Rebekah Mercer is on the board of the Moving Picture Institute, a conservative group devoted to countering Hollywood liberalism with original online entertainment. Among its recent projects was a cartoon, “Everyone Coughs,” which spread the rumor that Hillary Clinton was mortally ill. The film ended by depicting an animated Clinton literally coughing herself to death.","On Election Night in 2012, the Mercers and other top conservative donors settled into the V.I.P. section of a Republican Party victory celebration, having been assured that their investments would pay off. Obama’s defeat of Mitt Romney particularly infuriated Rebekah Mercer, who concluded that the pollsters, the data crunchers, and the spin doctors were all frauds. Soon afterward, Republican Party officials invited big donors to the University Club, in New York, for a postmortem on the election. Attendees were stunned when Rebekah Mercer “ripped the shit out of them,” a friend of hers told me, adding, “It was really her coming out.” As the Financial Times has reported, from that point on Mercer wanted to know exactly how her donations were being spent, and wanted to invest only in what another friend described as “things that she thinks put lead on the target.”","That year, Rebekah Mercer joined the board of the Government Accountability Institute, a nonprofit group, based in Tallahassee, which Bannon had recently founded. In 2013, the Mercer Family Foundation contributed a million dollars to the institute, and in 2014 it contributed another million. In 2015, it donated $1.7 million, which exceeded the group’s entire budget the previous year. The G.A.I., meanwhile, paid Bannon three hundred and seventy-six thousand dollars during its first four years; it told the I.R.S. that Bannon was working for it thirty hours a week, ostensibly on top of his full-time job running Breitbart News.","The G.A.I. billed itself as a nonpartisan research institute, but in 2015 Bannon told Bloomberg Businessweek that its mission was to dig up dirt on politicians and feed it to the mainstream media. (A G.A.I. staffer called this “weaponizing” information.) The group reportedly hired an expert to comb the Deep Web—sites that don’t show up in standard searches—for incriminating information about its targets. The plan was to exploit the mainstream media’s growing inability to finance investigative reporting by doing it for them. The strategy paid off spectacularly in April, 2015, when the Times ran a front-page article based on the book “Clinton Cash,” a compendium of corruption allegations against the Clintons, which was written by the G.A.I.’s president, the conservative writer Peter Schweizer. (The G.A.I. had given the paper an advance copy.) The book triggered one story after another about Hillary Clinton’s supposed criminality, and became a best-seller. In 2016, a film version, co-produced by Bannon and Rebekah Mercer, débuted at the Cannes Film Festival, as the Mercers’ yacht bobbed offshore.","The G.A.I. also undermined Jeb Bush, the candidate favored by the Republican establishment, with another Schweizer book, “Bush Bucks.” As Bannon put it in a 2015 interview, it depicted Bush as a figure of “grimy, low-energy crony capitalism.”","During this period, the Mercers continued giving money to election campaigns. In 2014, Robert Mercer made a two-and-a-half-million-dollar contribution to the Kochs’ Freedom Partners Action Fund. This exceeded the two-million-dollar contributions of David and Charles Koch, prompting a memorable headline about Mercer from Bloomberg News: “The Man Who Out-koched the Kochs.”","Rebekah Mercer, meanwhile, was growing impatient with the Kochs. She felt that they needed to investigate why their network had failed to defeat Obama in 2012. Instead, the Kochs gathered donors and presented them with more empty rhetoric. Mercer demanded an accounting of what had gone wrong, and when they ignored her she decided to start her own operation. In a further blow, Mercer soured several other top donors on the Kochs.","In 2012, one area in which the Republicans had lagged badly behind the Democrats was in the use of digital analytics. The Mercers decided to finance their own big-data project. In 2014, Michal Kosinski, a researcher in the psychology department at the University of Cambridge, was working in the emerging field of psychometrics, the quantitative study of human characteristics. He learned from a colleague that a British company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, wanted to hire academics to pursue similar research, for commercial purposes. Kosinski had circulated personality tests on Facebook and, in the process, obtained huge amounts of information about users. From this data, algorithms could be fashioned that would predict people’s behavior and anticipate their reactions to other online prompts. Those who took the Facebook quizzes, however, had been promised that the information would be used strictly for academic purposes. Kosinski felt that repurposing it for commercial use was unethical, and possibly illegal. His concerns deepened when he researched S.C.L. He was disturbed to learn that the company specialized in psychological warfare, and in influencing elections. He spurned the chance to work with S.C.L., although his colleague signed a contract with the company.","Kosinski was further disconcerted when he learned that a new American affiliate of S.C.L., Cambridge Analytica—owned principally by an American hedge-fund tycoon named Robert Mercer—was attempting to influence elections in the U.S. Kosinski, who is now an assistant professor of organizational behavior at Stanford’s business school, supports the idea of using psychometric data to “nudge” people toward socially positive behavior, such as voting. But, he told me, “there’s a thin line between convincing people and manipulating them.”","It is unclear if the Mercers have pushed Cambridge Analytica to cross that line. A company spokesman declined to comment for this story. What is clear is that Mercer, having revolutionized the use of data on Wall Street, was eager to accomplish the same feat in the political realm. He screened many data-mining companies before investing, and he chose Cambridge Analytica, in part, because its high concentration of accomplished scientists reminded him of Renaissance Technologies. Rebekah Mercer, too, has been deeply involved in the venture. Cambridge Analytica shares a corporate address in Manhattan with a group she chairs, Reclaim New York, which opposes government spending. (Bannon has reportedly served as a corporate officer for both Reclaim and Cambridge Analytica.)","Political scientists and consultants continue to debate Cambridge Analytica’s record in the 2016 campaign. David Karpf, an associate professor at George Washington University who studies the political use of data, calls the firm’s claim to have special psychometric powers “a marketing pitch” that’s “untrue.” Karpf worries, though, that the company “could take a very dark turn.” He explained, “What they could do is set up a MoveOn-style operation with a Tea Party-ish list that they could whip up. Typically, lists like that are used to pressure elected officials, but the dangerous thing would be if it was used instead to pressure fellow-citizens. It could encourage vigilantism.” Karpf said of Cambridge Analytica, “There is a maximalist scenario in which we should be terrified to have a tool like this in private hands.”","Cambridge Analytica is not the only data-driven political project that the Mercers have backed. In 2013, at a conservative conference in Palm Beach, an oil tycoon named William Lee Hanley, who had commissioned some polls from Patrick Caddell, asked him to show the data to Mercer and Bannon, who were at the event. The data showed mounting anger toward wealthy élites, who many Americans believed had corrupted the government so that it served only their interests. There was a hunger for a populist Presidential candidate who would run against the major political parties and the ruling class. The data “showed that someone could just walk into this election and sweep it,” Caddell told me. When Mercer saw the numbers, he asked for the polling to be repeated. Caddell got the same results. “It was stunning,” he said. “The country was on the verge of an uprising against its leaders. I just fell over!”","Until Election Day in 2016, Mercer and Hanley—two of the richest men in America—paid Caddell to keep collecting polling data that enabled them to exploit the public’s resentment of élites such as themselves. Caddell’s original goal was to persuade his sponsors to back an independent candidate, but they never did. In 2014, Caddell and two partners went public with what they called the Candidate Smith project, which promoted data suggesting that the public wanted a “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” figure—an outsider—as President. During the next year or so, Caddell’s poll numbers tilted more and more away from the establishment. Caddell’s partner Bob Perkins, an advertising executive and a former finance director of the Republican Party, told me, “By then, it was clear there wouldn’t be a third-party candidate. But we thought that a Republican who harnessed the angst had a real chance.” At one point, Caddell tested all the declared Presidential candidates, including Trump, as a possible Mr. Smith. “People didn’t think Trump had the temperament to be President,” Caddell said. “He clearly wasn’t the best Smith, but he was the only Smith. He was the only one with the resources and the name recognition.” As Bernie Sanders’s campaign showed, the populist rebellion wasn’t partisan. Caddell worried, though, that there were dark undertones in the numbers: Americans were increasingly yearning for a “strong man” to fix the country.","Caddell circulated his research to anyone who would listen, and that included people inside the Trump campaign. “Pat Caddell is like an Old Testament prophet,” Bannon said. “He’s been talking about alienation of the voters for twenty-five years, and people didn’t pay attention—but he’s a brilliant guy, and he nailed it.” The political consultant and strategist Roger Stone, who is a longtime Trump confidant, was fascinated by the research, and he forwarded a memo about it to Trump. Caddell said that he spoke with Trump about “some of the data,” but noted, “With Trump, it’s all instinct—he is not exactly a deep-dive thinker.”","Robert Mercer, too, was kept informed. Perkins said, “He just loves the numbers. Most people say, ‘Tell me what you think—don’t show me the numbers.’ But he’s, like, ‘Give me the numbers!’ ”","During the 2016 campaign, as the Mercers considered which Presidential candidate to back, they rejected insiders such as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, who they believed couldn’t win. They initially gravitated toward Ted Cruz, in part because he was an outsider in the Senate—loathed by even his Republican peers. During the primaries, the Mercers gave eleven million dollars to a super PAC supporting Cruz, run by Kellyanne Conway. According to Politico, Rebekah Mercer soon “wore out her welcome” with the Cruz campaign by offering withering appraisals of his debate performances. She also insisted that the campaign hire Cambridge Analytica, even though Cruz campaign officials were skeptical of it.","After Cruz dropped out, many Republicans—including Cruz himself—recoiled from Trump. The Mercers, however, joined the Trump camp, and publicly rebuked Cruz, giving a statement to the Times. If Clinton won, the Mercers claimed, she would “repeal both the First and Second Amendments of the Bill of Rights.” Given the stakes, they said, “all hands” were “needed on deck” in order to insure a Trump victory. Cruz, they noted, had “chosen to stay in his bunk below.”","The Mercers redirected their Cruz super PAC to support Trump, and gave two million dollars to it. According to one Trump adviser, there were strings attached to the donation. He says that, two weeks before Cruz dropped out, Bannon urged the Trump campaign to talk to Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s C.E.O., about hiring the company. (The previous year, the Trump campaign had rebuffed a pitch from the firm.) The adviser said that Nix followed up and offered cash inducements, in the form of a “finder’s fee,” to a Trump operative. (A Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied that this occurred.) Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager at the time, said that he knew nothing of Nix’s cash offer but gave Cambridge Analytica a limited contract, though he didn’t see the need, in deference to the Mercers.","Later that summer, Manafort was forced to resign, after the press reported his links to Ukrainian oligarchs. In the vacuum, the Mercers soon established control over the Trump campaign. Rebekah Mercer successfully pushed for a staff shakeup that led to the promotions of three people funded by the family: Bannon became the campaign’s C.E.O., Conway its manager, and Bossie its deputy manager. William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard and an adamant Trump opponent, warned, “It’s the merger of the Trump campaign with the kooky right.” But an e-mail that Bannon sent to a friend in 2015, and that was later leaked to the Daily Beast, confirms that the elevation of the Mercers and their operatives was, in many ways, a formality. A year before Bannon joined Trump’s campaign staff, he described himself in the e-mail as Trump’s de-facto “campaign manager,” because of the positive coverage that Breitbart was giving Trump. That coverage had largely been underwritten by the Mercers.","Brendan Fischer, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, said that the Mercers’ financial entanglement with the Trump campaign was “bizarre” and potentially “illegal.” The group has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which notes that, at the end of the 2016 campaign, the super PAC run by the Mercers paid Glittering Steel—a film-production company that shares an address in Los Angeles with Cambridge Analytica and Breitbart News—two hundred and eighty thousand dollars, supposedly for campaign ads attacking Hillary Clinton. Although Bannon was running Trump’s campaign, Fischer said that it appears to have paid him nothing. Meanwhile, the Mercers’ super PAC made a payment of about five million dollars to Cambridge Analytica, which was incorporated at the same address as Bannon Strategic Advisors. Super PACs are legally required to stay independent of a candidate’s campaign. But, Fischer said, “it raises the possibility of the Mercers subsidizing Steve Bannon’s work for the Trump campaign.”","On December 3rd, the Mercer family hosted a victory celebration at Owl’s Nest—a costume party with a heroes-and-villains theme. Rebekah Mercer welcomed several hundred guests, including Donald Trump. In extemporaneous remarks, Trump thanked the Mercers, saying that they had been “instrumental in bringing some organization” to his campaign. He specifically named Bannon, Conway, and Bossie. Trump then joked that he’d just had the longest conversation of his life with Bob Mercer—and it was just “two words.” A guest at the party told me, “I was looking around the room, and I thought, No doubt about it—the people whom the Mercers invested in, my comrades, are now in charge.”","After the election, Rebekah Mercer was rewarded with a seat on Trump’s transition team. “She basically bought herself a seat,” Fischer said. She had strong feelings about who should be nominated to Cabinet positions and other top government jobs. Not all her ideas were embraced. She unsuccessfully pushed for John Bolton, the hawkish former Ambassador to the United Nations, to be named Secretary of State. So far, her suggestion that Arthur Robinson, the Oregon biochemist, be named the national science adviser has gone nowhere. Like her father, she advocates a return to the gold standard, but as of yet she has failed to get Trump to appoint officials who share this view.","Still, Mercer made her influence felt. Her pick for national-security adviser was Michael Flynn, and Trump chose him for the job. (Flynn lasted only a month, after he lied about having spoken with the Russian Ambassador before taking office.) More important, several people to whom Mercer is very close—including Bannon and Conway—have become some of the most powerful figures in the world.","Rebekah’s father, meanwhile, can no longer be considered a political outsider. David Magerman, in his essay for the Inquirer, notes that Mercer “has surrounded our President with his people, and his people have an outsized influence over the running of our country, simply because Robert Mercer paid for their seats.” He writes, “Everyone has a right to express their views.” But, he adds, “when the government becomes more like a corporation, with the richest 0.001% buying shares and demanding board seats, then we cease to be a representative democracy.” Instead, he warns, “we become an oligarchy.” ♦","An earlier version of this article misstated David Karpf’s position at George Washington University.","This article appears in the print edition of the March 27, 2017, issue, with the headline “Trump’s Money Man.”"],"isopubdate":""}

But it looks like this is easier said than done. No sooner is Facebook coming to terms with one issue, there is another one waiting at the door to creep on to the collective conscience of its users. And this has been happening so regularly of late, that one has been left numb to an extent.","A 3D plastic representation of the Facebook logo. Reuters.","The most recent of the thorns in Facebook's crown is courtesy the alleged misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica. Last Friday, Facebook suspended Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica after it emerged that it was using data shared by a developer who was supposed to use it only for his own app.","According to Facebook, \"In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.\"","While one may have thought that this was pro-active action by Facebook — despite it being three years too late — it was only on the following day that the reason behind the suspension of SCL became amply clear. Turns out news media organisations such as The Guardian and New York Timeshad a story which would blow the lid of the data analytics firm methods and this could have had a hand in assisting with Donald Trump's victory, by manipulating voter behaviour.","So let's see how this latest controversy has played out so far.","What's Cambridge Analytica and why is it in the news?","Cambridge Analytica (CA) is a UK-based data analytics firm with its parent company named Strategic Communications Laboratories. The purpose of CA is to come up with online political campaigns, reach out to potential voters online and it does this by combining data from multiple sources including online information.","It is also the firm that worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign as well as with the Leave EU camp during Brexit. One of its co-founders and data analysts at Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie shared evidence about the company having harvested data from close to 50 million users on Facebook. This was done without the express permission of the said users. CA then used this information to create a psychological profile of the users as well as their friends based on their online activities. This was then used for targetted political advertising during UK's Brexit referendum as well as during the 2016 US presidential elections.","Cambridge Analytica logo","CA is said to have got this private data from Cambridge researcher Alexsandr Kogan, who created an app called 'thisisyourdigitallife' to offer personality predictions online. Now, Facebook lets app developers seek permissions from users to use their personal data to help develop the app. In this particular case, Kogan's app offered users a personality prediction after they agreed to take a personality test. Around 270,000 people downloaded the app. They gave their consent to Kogan to access their public information as well as limited information about their friends. Now while Kogan got access to this data, it was only meant to be used by him for developing his app. Instead, Kogan went ahead and sold this data to CA, which then used it to tweak their social strategies for the Trump election campaigns.","To give an idea, say if you had downloaded this app and taken the personality quiz, Kogan's app was able to determine your race, gender, sexual orientation, which political party you were most likely to vote for, and even predicting your vulnerability to substance abuse. That is quite specific information and something that most of us don't publicly share. Yet, this is the kind of deductions Kogan's app was able to make after you downloaded the app and answered a few queries.","CA also got funding from US billionaire Robert Mercer, who is also a major investor in alt-right website Breitbart News. And Steve Bannon, who served as a chief strategist in the first seven months of Trump administration and a founding member of Breitbart News was also theadvisor to CA for a while.","Who is Christopher Wylie and what are his allegations?","Christopher Wylie. Image: twitter/@chrisinsilico","Christopher Wylie is the co-founder and former research lead at Cambridge Analytica, who blew the whistle on CA's unethical activities. Speaking to The Guardian, Wylie said that the company exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles and used that to build models to target these same people.","According to Wylie, Facebook suspended his account for his act of blowing the whistle on something that Facebook knew privately for about two years.","Explaining the process to Channel 4 News, Wylie said that Kogan's app paid thousands of users (a lot of them hired by CA using Amazon's Mechanical Turks platform) a small amount of money to take an online personality quiz after they downloaded the app. While downloading the app users gave consent for Kogan's app to use their personal data, location and some publicly available data of your friends as well (this feature of accessing friends' data was discontinued in 2015). Then using the source code from the responses Kogan's app got, it was fed into an algorithm which would create a user psychological profile of the user. On an average, for every user survey, Kogan's app captured records of up to 300 Facebook users.","\"I just need to engage 70,000 to 100,000 people to get a really big data set, really quickly. This method scaled very quickly and we were able to get upwards of 50 million plus Facebook records within a span of a couple of months,\" said Wylie saying that almost none of those 50 million users were aware that their data was being used.","File image of Steve Bannon. AP","Wylie spoke about how the Trump campaign used the data to create sort of culture war. \"Steve (Bannon) wanted weapons for his culture war and we offered him a way to accomplish what he wanted to do, which was to change the culture of America,\" said Wylie.","What are Cambridge Analytica's responses?","CA responded to Facebook's suspension order by stating that it does not hold data from Facebook profiles. CA acknowledged that it had contracted a company, Global Science Research (GSR) (which was founded by Kogan), for a large-scale research project. According to CA, GSR was only to obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and after seeking user consent.","\"GSR obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR. No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" says CA.","U.S. President Donald Trump/ AP","What's Facebook's response?","According to Facebook, there is no data breach as the users who had downloaded the app made by Kogan, did so of their own accord.","\"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" said Facebook. On the topic of the data of friends also being compromised, Facebook's 'platform policy' allows only the collection of friends' data to improve the in-app user experience and this data is not meant to be sold outside. For now, Facebook has suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Dr Alexsandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie, till further investigations.","In what can be construed as a self-goal, Facebook even threatened The Guardian with a legal noticeagainst publishing the report, calling it 'false and defamatory' allegations.","Facebook's arguments denying the 'data breach' have a similar tone of the UIDAI denying any issues with Aadhaar security despite the many data vulnerabilities.","How is it related to the Trump election campaign?","CA was hired by the Trump campaign to help with data crunching during the 2016 election season. Steve Bannon, then chairman of Breitbart News, who eventually became an advisor to Trump, was also said to be the vice president of CA's board. CA guided Trump's campaign team on how best to target voters using ads or speeches or making the strategic campaign stops. While this may look like any other service persuading voters to vote for their party, according to Wiley what CA did was manipulating voters into voting for Trump.","Who is Facebook answerable to now?","Facebook is already facing the music in the US with regards to the involvement of Russian entities in gaming Facebook's ad platform. This revelation can only make things worse for Facebook. Even though Facebook says that there isn't a data breach, because users who downloaded Kogan's app did so of their own volition, the friends of these users who may not have interacted with the app had to let go of their data unknowingly.","Britain's information commissioner is investigating whether Facebook data was \"illegally acquired and used,\" after it suspended CA. In the US, several Republican lawmakers have expressed serious concerns over privacy violations after this story broke out.","File photo of Mark Zuckerberg. Reuters","Republican Senator Jeff Flake said he had a lot of questions about the data taken from Facebook, including who knew it had been taken and whether it is still being used.","“This is a big deal when you have that amount of data, and the privacy violations there are significant,” he told CNN’s State of the Union program. “So the question is who knew it and when did they know it, how long did this go on and what happens to that data now.”","Facebook faced new calls for regulation from Democratic senators on 17 March and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards, but it was unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress would act.","Cambridge Analytica eyeing India","According to a report in Hindustan Times, the UK-based firm has its eyes on South-Asian countries such as India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as they approach elections. The report states that CA and its India partner Oveleno Business Intelligence (OBI) have reached out to Congress and BJP for a possible collaboration for the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha elections.","According to OBI CEO, Amrish Tyagi, the company is in talks with CA which has denied the allegations and is looking at legal measures. \"We are partners. If something is established to be in violation of Indian law, then we will, of course, reconsider it,\" said Tyagi. So far according to Tyagi, CA has no projects in India so there is no question of them having done any social media work here.","What happens now?","We can rest assured that this matter will be in the news cycle for quite a while. The extent of the data breach is still not fully known. Whether Facebook and Cambridge Analytica will take the legal route is something that only time will tell. As for your personal data, as is evident from Wylie's confession, even if you may not have downloaded and used the 'thisisyourdigitallife' app, if you were friends with someone who had and hadn't really set your privacy settings, then your personal data is most surely part of the sweep.","As it is, Facebook and a lot of social media websites have been facing the music from governments especially in the US, the UK as well as the EU. This data breach will only strengthen the voices of critics who are asking for more regulation of social media.","As for Wylie, he could be sued by CA or Bannon for breaking any confidentiality agreements they may have had."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Roughly 270,000 US-based Facebook users voluntarily responded to the test in 2014. But the app also collected data on those participants’ Facebook friends without their consent.","Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who previously worked as a contractor at Cambridge Analytica, told the Guardian that the company used the data to target American voters ahead of President Donald Trump’s victory in 2016. He claimed that Cambridge Analytica was a “full-service propaganda machine”.","Cambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing and said that the business tactics it used are widespread among other firms. For his part, Kogan insists that what he did was at all times compliant with the law – and also says, according to CNN, that he would be happy to testify before US Congress and talk to the FBI about the work he did for the company.","Facebook said on March 18 that it had suspended SCL, alleging that Kogan had “lied to us and violated our platform policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica.” Facebook states under part three of its platform policy that developers do not have permission to “transfer any data that you receive from us (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived data) to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetisation-related service.”","We are aware that Dr Kogan established his own company, Global Science Research (GSR), of which SCL/Cambridge Analytica was a client. It is not uncommon for Cambridge academics to have business interests, but they must satisfy the university that these are held in a personal capacity and that there are no conflicts of interest.","It is our understanding that the thisisyourdigitallife app was created by GSR. Based on assurances from Dr Kogan as well as the evidence available to us, we have no reason to believe he used university data or facilities for his work with GSR, and therefore that there is no reason to believe the university’s data and facilities were used as the basis for GSR’s subsequent work with any other party.","A day after the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit, Facebook’s shares plummeted on Wall Street amid the privacy backlash. But could the incident affect legitimate academic research?","Implications","Social media data is a rich source of information for many areas of research in psychology, technology, business and humanities. Some recent examples include using Facebook to predict riots, comparing the use of Facebook with body image concern in adolescent girls and investigating whether Facebook can lower levels of stress responses, with research suggesting that it may enhance and undermine psycho-social constructs related to well-being.","It is right to believe that researchers and their employers value research integrity. But instances where trust has been betrayed by an academic – even if it’s the case that data used for university research purposes wasn’t caught in the crossfire – will have a negative impact on whether participants will continue to trust researchers. It also has implications for research governance and for companies to share data with researchers in the first place.","Universities, research organisations and funders govern the integrity of research with clear and strict ethics procedures designed to protect participants in studies, such as where social media data is used. The harvesting of data without permission from users is considered an unethical activity under commonly understood research standards.","The fallout from the Cambridge Analytica controversy is potentially huge for researchers who rely on social networks for their studies, where data is routinely shared with them for research purposes. Tech companies could become more reluctant to share data with researchers. Facebook is already extremely protective of its data – the worry is that it could become doubly difficult for researchers to legitimately access this information in light of what has happened with Cambridge Analytica.","Data analytics","Clearly, it’s not just researchers who use profile data to better understand people’s behavioural patterns. Marketing organisations have been profiling consumers for decades – if they know their customers, they will understand the triggers that prompt a purchase of their product, enabling them to adjust marketing messages to improve sales. It has become easier with digital marketing – people are constantly tracked online, their activities are analysed using data analytics tools and personal recommendations are made. Such methods are core to the business strategies of tech giants’ such as Amazon and Netflix.","Information from online behaviour can be used to predict people’s mood, emotions and personality. My own research into Intelligent Tutoring Systems uses learner interactions with software to profile personality type so it can automatically adapt tutoring to someone’s preferred style. Machine learning techniques can combine theories from psychology with new patterns found – such as Facebook “likes” – to profile users.","Eli Pariser, who is the CEO of viral content website Upworthy, has been arguing against personalisation tools since 2011. He has warned against the dangers of information filtering, and believes that the use of algorithms – to profile people to show them information tailored to personal tastes – is bad for democracy.","While these fears appear to be borne out by some allegations levelled against Cambridge Analytica, it’s worth noting that there has been no evidence to show that US votes were swung in favour of Trump due to Cambridge Analytica’s psychometric tool.","However, given his academic status, Kogan’s apparent decision to transfer Facebook data for commercial ends in violation of the social network’s policies could yet have explosive consequences, not least because researchers might find it more difficult to get Facebook – and its users – to agree to hand over the data for research alone."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Ars Technica points out that older versions of Android allowed apps to gain access to call and message logs when users actually just gave permission to read contacts.","It seems Facebook thought its users had given permission to share call and text logs with it. But users may never have explicitly chosen to do that.","The question now becomes how many people will see this simply as yet another Facebook privacy scandal, perhaps overlooking the nuances of deprecated Android versions and app permissions.","Headlines matter for Facebook right now","\"In this case, headlines matter very much for the stock,\" the analysts said in a note published March 19. \"While there will be plenty of journalists and others who can parse exactly what happened regarding this most recent issue involving Cambridge Analytica in terms of number of accounts and whether this was a 'data breach' or not, the details matter very little when looking at this through the narrow lens of an equity analyst. What matters for this stock, at this time, are the headlines.\"","Facebook's skeletons are tumbling out of the closet","Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images The timing of the two stories gives the impression that Facebook is dealing with a privacy scandal. It is — but the issues aren't new. Instead, they're problems the company put off dealing with.","Facebook knew that Cambridge Analytica had improperly accessed its data in 2015, when a Guardian journalist revealed that the research firm had harvested data on millions of Facebook users. Facebook had already changed its app settings to stop people from handing over their friends' data, but it didn't bar Cambridge Analytica and continued to allow the company to operate on its platform.","And the new Android issue was due to a version of the Android operating system that allowed Facebook to gain message and call logs from 2015 to 2017. Again, it's an old issue for Facebook that isn't ongoing, but a lack of transparency and decisive action at the time has come back to hurt the firm."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The company rejected the notion that a data breach had occurred, saying users willingly shared their information with researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who then shared it with Cambridge Analytica.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

According to Ben Shapiro, The Guardian reported that Obama's re-election team was \"building a vast digital data operation that for the first time combines a unified database on millions of Americans with the power of Facebook, to target individual voters to a degree never achieved before.\"","They go on to say that Obama's new database would be gathered by asking people to log in to Obama's re-election site using their Facebook credentials; further stating, \"Consciously or otherwise, the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they store publicly on their Facebook page — home location, date of birth, interests and, crucially, network of friends — directly into the central Obama database.","The article quotes Obama's director of integration and media analytics, saying during the 2012 campaign, Facebook \"was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn't stop us once they realized that was what we were doing.\" She added, \"They came to (the) office in the days following the election and were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.\"","Didn't it seem odd that Obama visited the headquarters of Facebook in April 2011 just to discuss taxes and Medicare?

Facebook is treated as if it is simply a conduit for information, meaning it is not liable for the content its users share – in the same way that BT can’t be sued when people make threatening phone calls.","In 2014 Iain MacKenzie, a spokesperson for Facebook, said, “Every piece of content on Facebook has an associated ‘report’ option that escalates it to your user operations team for review. Additionally, individuals can block anyone who is harassing them, ensuring they will be unable to interact further. Facebook tackles malicious behaviour through a combination of social mechanisms and technological solutions appropriate for a mass-scale online opportunity.”","But the company is evasive about the number of moderators it employs, how they work, and how decisions are made. It has started taking a firmer line on far-right content – recently removing Britain First pages from the site – but it is still resisting many legislative attempts to regulate its content. What content users then see is decided by an algorithm that can change without any consultation, including with the government or the businesses that rely on Facebook for revenue – meaning that some can be quickly wiped off the map. In February 2018 the website Digiday reported on LittleThings, a four-year-old site that shut down overnight after Facebook decided to prioritise user posts over publisher content. A hundred jobs were lost.","Facebook wasn’t the only contributor to LittleThings’ demise, but those working at the website said there was nowhere else to go after the algorithm change. And this isn’t the only example: in 2013 an algorithm change halved the traffic of viral content website Upworthy – something from which the website has never recovered.","The impact of Facebook’s dominance means that publications are constantly scrambling to keep up with the platform’s changing strategy. The editor-in-chief of Wired, Nick Thompson, recently told the Digiday podcast that there was a fear “Facebook has a dial somewhere that can be turned to cut off media that gets too uppity”.","Much has been made of the fact that Facebook creates “filter bubbles”. It has been criticised for prioritising content that users will like – meaning there is less diversity in the news stories people read – and for failing to crack down on propaganda. In fact, Italy’s new far-right star Matteo Salvini explicitly thanked Facebook for contributing to the country’s recent election results.","All this from a company that in 2016 paid just £5.1m in corporation tax on its UK operations, despite profit and revenues nearly quadrupling on the back of increased advertising sales. In December 2017, Facebook announced it would start booking advertising revenue in countries where it was earned, instead of rerouting it via Ireland, although – as this newspaper reported – the move is “unlikely to result in it paying much more tax”. This is despite Zuckerberg calling for governments to start paying a universal basic income for every citizen as a response to automation, driven in part by Silicon Valley.","Even if we want to avoid the site and keep our data protected, it’s not as easy as one might think. According to Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook, the company uses techniques found in propaganda and casino gambling to foster psychological addiction in its users – such as constant notifications and variable rewards. By keeping us hooked, Facebook is able to hold a huge amount of data on us. What is surprising, and worrying, is the derived data Facebook has – the profiles it can build of its users based on seemingly innocuous information. The author of the book Networks of Control, Wolfie Christl, noted that a patent published by Facebook works out people’s commute times by using location data from mobile apps. It then uses this and other data to segregate users into social classes.","Facebook’s massive data cache goes hand in hand with its acquisition of competitors. Nick Srnicek, author of Platform Capitalism, says, “Facebook is acting like a classic monopoly: it’s buying up competitors like Instagram, it’s blatantly copying rivals like Snapchat, and it even has its own app, Onavo, that acts to warn them of potential threats. All of this is combined with an unchecked sweeping up of our data that’s being used to build an impervious moat around its business.”","If ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence. So perhaps it’s time to start treating Facebook as the giant multinational corporation it is – especially because people with Facebook profiles aren’t the company’s customers: they are the product it sells to advertisers."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information.","Image","Facebook is rolling out a new centralized page for people to view and control their privacy and security settings.","Facebook began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after revelations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million users of the social network. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reawakened fears over how much information the social network has gathered about people, leading to a #DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism.","“The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, a Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement announcing the new system. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.”","The Cambridge Analytica scandal has plunged Facebook into its worst crisis in years, with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain demanding answers about how the social network deals with data privacy. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has agreed to appear in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill next month, people familiar with the decision have said.","Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement that Facebook had to do better with user data and promised to roll out products that give users more control over their information and privacy settings.","Video","In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which data from over 50 million Facebook profiles was secretly scraped and mined for voter insights, many Facebook users have decided to delete their accounts — but untangling yourself from a site like Facebook is not as easy as pressing “delete.”Published OnMarch 21, 2018","“One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data,” he told The New York Times last week. “Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar.","Late Wednesday, Facebook also said that it was halting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third-party data brokers. These are business-to-business companies that can collect a vast range of details about individual consumers such as their shopping habits, health concerns, income range and preferred credit card.","The social network had previously allowed advertisers to use consumer details from data brokers like Experian, Acxiom and Oracle’s Datalogix unit to help target ads to Facebook users. But Facebook said it was now mothballing that option, called “Partner Categories.”","”We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories,” Graham Mudd, a product marketing director at Facebook, said in a statement.","“This product enables third-party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook,” he added. “While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.”","In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry into data brokers and subsequently recommended that Congress consider enacting a law “to make data broker practices more visible to consumers and to give consumers greater control over the immense amounts of personal information about them collected and shared by data brokers.”","How much of a difference these actions may make to Facebook’s data privacy practices was unclear. Some privacy advocates noted, for instance, that the company’s new centralized privacy and security settings page has been tried in the past.","“The platform made similar promises many times before,” said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies how technology affects society. She pointed out that in 2010, Mr. Zuckerberg said in The Washington Post that Facebook users needed simpler controls over their privacy and had promised then that Facebook would “add privacy controls that are much simpler to use.”","Yet eight years later, the same concerns have resurfaced, Ms. Tufekci said.","“The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves, aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its C.E.O.,” she said.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Facebook, Stung by Data Harvest, Says It Will Centralize Its Privacy Settings.

In it, Zuckerberg takes responsibility for Cambridge Analytica’s abuse of the Facebook platform, and promises that the company will do better in the future.","“We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you. I’ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” Zuckerberg said. “The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it.”","The statement goes on to describe how Facebook intends to address the problem going forward, but Zuckerberg is quick to point out that the company has already taken the first steps toward securing your data. First, Zuckerberg claims, Facebook will be auditing thousands of apps which may have improperly accessed user data.","“We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity,” Zuckerberg said. “We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit. And if we find developers that misused personally identifiable information, we will ban them and tell everyone affected by those apps.”","Second, Facebook will be cracking down on developers access to your personal data, reducing the data apps are able to access when you use Facebook to login — restricting it to just your name, profile photo, and email address. Lastly, Facebook will now list apps which have access to your private data in a bar above your news feed. You can already access this information, but Zuckerberg says moving it to a more visible location will keep people aware of which apps have access to their data. Users will be able to revoke permissions without digging into their privacy settings.","It’s a good set of first steps, but what Zuckerberg fails to mention is why it took Facebook over two years to publicly acknowledge the problem, when it knew sensitive user data was compromised.","Here’s what happened","While some outlets have reported that this was the result of a breach, the social network denies this claim. In the company’s statement, Facebook VP and Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal said that the reports regarding a data breach were “completely false.”","The truth seems more complex than that.","Cambridge Analytica, which is best known for its work alongside Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, obtained the information from Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” The app billed itself as a personality test and was downloaded by about 270,000 people. By downloading the app, the users gave permission for the app’s developers to access information regarding the city they lived in, what kind of content they liked on Facebook, and other general information.","But by sniffing through the friends of those users, and the friends of friends, the company was able to gather up info on 50 million people in total, according to the New York Times — none of whom granted the company permission to use or even access to their data, these details were corroborated in Zuckerberg’s statement.","“The firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history,” the Times reported. This may not have been a data breach, but user’s wishes certainly weren’t honored.","While Kogan obtained the information on the initial 270,000 users legitimately and in accordance with Facebook’s rules, he then proceeded to violate those rules by sharing them with a third party — in this case, Cambridge Analytica.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies,” Grewal wrote. “When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","Meanwhile, threats of legal action are beginning to appear. On Saturday, Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey said she planned to look into the situation.","Last week, Facebook received reports that not all of the data had been destroyed as promised. Facebook has not yet verified these claims, but has chosen to suspend SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the site while it investigates these accusations.","Facebook isn’t the only organization looking into Cambridge Analytica. The Guardian has reported that the British Election Commission is investigating the organization in regards to the Brexit vote, which saw the U.K. vote to leave the European Union.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the Commission’s Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the U.K. are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","Facebook itself has faced questions regarding how it handles user data as well.","As part of efforts to put the Cambridge Analytica scandal and related issues behind it, Facebook said this week it's expanding its bug bounty program to include third-party apps and websites that could potentially misuse its data.","Amazon's massive growth in recent years has led to an internal black market where some employees are paid for insider data or illicit services to help merchants gain an edge.

We found a pattern of political activity at odds with the company’s public image.","At 33, Mark Zuckerberg is one of the world’s most recognizable names. Zuckerberg is also one of its richest, estimated to be worth $73.7 billion. The Facebook founder publicly espouses liberal notions on everything from gay rights to immigration but a closer look under the hood of Facebook’s finances and political operations reveals a record of support for conservative causes, opposition to LGBT rights and connections to Russian money.","Zuckerberg is now under enormous pressure to reveal more about Facebook’s role in a Russian propaganda campaign in support of Donald Trump in the 2016 election cycle. Despite a coy statement revealing $150,000 in advertising spend by a Russian social media firm with ties to Vladimir Putin and the FSB and new revelations the social network allowed Russian operatives posing as Americans to create and sell tickets to anti-immigration, secessionist, anti-LGBT and confederate events, Facebook is refusing to release the ads, groups and who was targeted.","“It appeared to me that the very social media sites that we rely on for virtually everything — our Facebooks, Googles and Twitters — it was my belief the Russians were using those sites to intervene in our elections,” Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) told CNN “And the first reaction from Facebook was: ‘Well you’re crazy, there’s nothing going on’ — well, we find yesterday there actually was something going on.”","Amid all this pressure, a renewed spotlight should be shone on why Facebook donated $120,000 to the Conservative Political Action Committee. Facebook made the donation to CPAC partly to allow conference attendees could easily produce Facebook Live videos, according to the Daily Beast. Facebook had previously contributed to production at the Republican and Democratic National Conventions but the decision to support a partisan action committee conference raises questions about the motives of the donation amid conflicting statements from Facebook and CPAC.","The social network acknowledged the payment but said “our involvement is not an endorsement of any particular position or platform.” CPAC’s Matt Schlapp indicated however there was some ideological participation: “We are glad Facebook agreed to be at CPAC and to acknowledge the importance of conservatives to their company, and we continue to work with them on issues important to conservatives,” he said.","The CPAC convention took place at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Md in February this year and featured President Donald Trump, VP Mike Pence, Stephen Bannon, Reince Priebus, Kellyanne Conway. The NRA which is also linked to Russian influence is a big funder of CPAC.","President Donald Trump speaks at the CPAC convention in February. Facebook donated $120,000 to the convention .","Since 2011, Facebook’s PAC has contributed more to GOP candidates including those with anti-LGBT positions.","Facebook started its own Political Action Committee in 2011. The PAC supports politicians on both sides of the aisle which tends to favor Republican causes, giving $477,000 to Republican candidates like John Boehner and Paul Ryan. The PAC gave Democrats $425,000 in donations including to John Kerry and Nancy Pelosi. The PAC only supported one presidential candidate in 2016, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who received $4,000.","Since 2012, Facebook has also favored politicians with anti-LGBT voting records. More than 40 percent of Facebook’s PAC contributions, totaling roughly $156,000, have gone to politicians voting against LGBT rights. In 2014, Northstar Asset Management which owns more than 55,000 shares in Facebook filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission demanding the company’s PAC fall in line with Facebook’s values of being pro-gay and intellectual property rights.","Facebook rejected the claim, saying: “We have practices in place to ensure the appropriate disclosure and oversight of our lobbying and political activities. The proposal seeks to impose requirements that would be cumbersome to apply, are not required by law and are not standard amongst other companies, including competitors”.","A look inside Facebook also reveals a culture devoid of diversity. There are literally no people of color on Facebook’s board which is mostly men. As a whole, 90% of Facebook is white or asian. In 2015, only 2% black overall and 3% black in senior leadership.","One of those white men who has a seat on the board is Peter Thiel, an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump (he personally donated $1.25 million to the Trump campaign and spoke at the RNC). Zuckerberg has resisted pressure to oust Thiel from the board but as investigators turn up evidence of Facebook’s role in targeting and delivering Facebook ads on behalf of the Trump campaign, Thiel’s role is likely to receive new scrutiny.","Zuckerberg touts Thiel as an example of ideological diversity. “I think the folks who are saying we shouldn’t have someone on our board because they’re a Republican, I think that’s crazy,” Zuckerberg told a forum at North Carolina A&T State University. “I think you need to have all kinds of diversity if you want to make progress together as a society.”","Thiel is also tied to mercenary Erik Prince, brother of Betsy DeVos who favors a private army take over the war in Afghanistan and is vocally opposed to rights for transgender people.","Facebook Founder Peter Thiel speaking at the Republican National Convention in 2016. He donated $1.25 million to Trump’s campaign.","One of Facebook’s biggest shareholders is a Russian company partly-owned by an oligarch known as the “hard man” of Russia and is very close to Vladimir Putin.","In 2009, Facebook was struggling financially. The company sought outside investment and it came from Russian internet holding company Digital Sky Technologies, which invested $200 million for 2% in the company in 2009 (the stake has since climbed to between 5.4% to 10% depending on who you ask). Digital Sky’s CEO is Russian oligarch Yuri Milner but its largest shareholder and initial funder is Alisher Usmanov who is known “as the hard man” of Russia.","Usmanov is criticised for being a “racketeer and gangster”. He is a convicted criminal and was in jail in the former Soviet Union though he claims he was a political prisoner. He owns Britain’s Arsenal Football Club and investments in mines, metals factories, media properties, and mobile phones in Russia. He is the Chairman of ‘Gazpromholdings’, a subsidiary of state-run Gazprom, which has been sanctioned by the U.S.","“Usmanov became a billionaire oligarch in the gangster takeover of Russia’s “privatised” mineral assets. He is close to Putin, and has been used by him to buy up and neutralise much of the little remaining independent media in Russia. Usmanov does this in his own name or as Chairman of ‘GazpromInvestHolding’. Independent journalists have died in mysterious accidents following Usmanov takeovers,” says former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray who has taken on a personal crusade against the oligarch and was sued for his effort.","Usmanov owns 35 per cent of DST which makes him the indirect owner of a significant amount of Facebook through Digital Sky. “For a blackmailer who is a key tool in Putin’s increasingly authoritarian regime, to have a share in Facebook is totally unacceptable,” says Murray.","Digital Sky’s CEO Milner presents a cleaner image to the world but is also very close to Putin, regularly attending meetings with Usmanov and the Russian president. DST is heavily invested in Silicon Valley including investments in Twitter, Groupon and many young startups.","Facebook’s reliance on DST was not just about getting Russian money. It gave the social network access to the Kremlin and the Russian digital market. “If Facebook wants to be successful in Russia, DST can bring a lot to the table besides knowledge. DST is close to the government there, the source said, and while outright involvement (or obstruction) from the Russian government is highly unlikely, if Facebook wants its business to go more smoothly, DST can help,” a source close to DST told CNET.","Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov who is indirectly invested in Facebook.","Facebook has many business reasons to supports conservative voices but it remains an open question how much they knew about Russia’s interference in 2016.","Silicon Valley is increasingly concerned about aggressive Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice antitrust investigations over “unfair or deceptive”, monopolies and online data collection and use, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and spam. According to Forbes, the FTC is known in Silicon Valley as the “Federal Technology Commission”. From a business perspective Facebook’s support for conservative allies makes some sense but that they fly in the social network’s public values could harm the company.","Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors and FBI agents is “zeroing in on how Russia spread fake and damaging information through social media and is seeking additional evidence from companies like Facebook and Twitter about what happened on their networks,” according to Bloomberg.","Mueller’s focus on social media is said to be “red hot” and Facebook, Twitter and Google executives may be called to testify in front of congressional committees as well. More troubling is a notion first floated by MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow that Facebook, Twitter and Google may indeed be the scene of the biggest political crime in history. This would expose the tech giants to extraordinary examination by prosecutors and ironically the very regulation they may have sought to dissuade with their political efforts.","6 thoughts on “A Dirty Little Secret”","Ok, who is going to be the next Ted Turner and open their own social site, open to everyone, all religions, all opinions, so that all of the Facebook, Google and Twitter fans, have a place to go without prejudice. We need someone other than Zuckerberg, who talks out of both sides of his mouth and says one thing but his behavior projects another one.

{"originalurl":"https://didyouknow.co.place/facebook-makes-its-privacy-data-downloading-and-deletion-settings-easier-to-find/","title":"Facebook makes its privacy, data downloading and deletion settings easier to find | Did You Know","text":["With Facebook facing a wave of public backlash over how it has handled user data over the years — a backlash that was kicked off two weeks ago with the revelation that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had worked on targeted election campaigns using personal and private Facebook data — the company today announced a new set of changes to help users find and change their privacy settings, as well as download and delete whatever data has been collected through Facebook’s network of social media services.","To be clear, many of these settings and features already existed in Facebook, but now Facebook is making them significantly clearer for the average user to find and use. It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe.","What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.)","We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front.","For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place:","User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now.\nPrivacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that.\nDownloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.","The news comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week posting an acknowledgement of Facebook’s role in the scandal, and a pledge to improve the company’s practices with regards to third-party apps and how Facebook works with them, and what data it will provide in the future, which he also followed up with a full-page apology printed in several newspapers.

Nix told the committee last month that his firm had not received data from a researcher accused of obtaining millions of Facebook users' personal information.","In Washington, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said on Twitter that Zuckerberg \"needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.\"","\"This is a major breach that must be investigated,\" Klobuchar, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said. \"It's clear these platforms can't police themselves.\"","Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, echoed Klobuchar's complaint.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" he said. \"It's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said on Twitter that \"Massachusetts residents deserve answers\" and announced that her office will investigate.","The officials reacted to reports in The New York Times and The Guardian of London that Cambridge Analytica, which is best known for working on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, had improperly obtained Facebook user data and retained it after claiming it had deleted the information.","Former Cambridge Analytica employee Chris Wylie said that the company obtained information from 50 million Facebook users, using it to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.","Wylie told Britain's Channel 4 news that the company was able to amass a huge database very quickly from an app developed by an academic that vacuumed up data from Facebook users who agreed to fill out a survey, as well as their friends and contacts — a process of which most were unaware.","\"Imagine I go and ask you: I say, 'Hey, if I give you a dollar, two dollars, could you fill up this survey for me, just do it on this app', and you say, 'Fine,'\" he said. \"I don't just capture what your responses are, I capture all of the information about you from Facebook.

(It also fails to learn that it has failed to control it.)","The rest is noise, as far as I’m concerned. Even if anyone really believes that sharing data about users is not the Facebook business model, who cares what its business model is? Whatever plausible sounding business model it had before didn’t protect anyone, and didn’t stop these characters from collecting and using data in all sorts of shady ways.","Of course there’s the strong possibility that Cambridge Analytica and others misused the data, didn’t delete it as promised, performed unsanctioned analyses on it. Oh no! Who would have thought someone would do that? The real question was what was Facebook expecting when it handed out data on millions essentially on the honor system?","Facebook’s business model is monetizing your data (the data you give it, it must be said), one way or the other.

The publication said it decided not to run the story because it didn’t find it credible.","In an eight-page letter written by Miss McDougal and obtained by the New Yorker magazine last month, it was claimed that she first met Mr Trump at a poolside party at the Playboy Mansion in June 2006.","After they had sex, she says Mr Trump offered her money. When she insisted she wasn’t ‘that girl’, he told her: ‘You are special.’ She claims they also slept together the following month at the Lake Tahoe golf tournament.","Ms Drake says she and two other women went to his room where Mr Trump, again in pyjamas and accompanied by a bodyguard, hugged and kissed them","According to Miss McDougal, Mr Trump liked to share articles about him and his daughter Ivanka with her.

He was deluged with sexual assault claims (all of which he denied) in the closing stages of the 2016 election, not that it made much difference to the result.","Voters even forgave him when a tape emerged in which he boasted graphically of groping women.","Alana Evans says that Mr Trump and Ms Daniels both pleaded with her on the phone to join them for a threesome during that action-packed golfing weekend","But in the opinion of some American legal experts, this time it could be different, with Ms Daniels being compared to Paula Jones, the woman whose 1994 sexual harassment lawsuit against president Bill Clinton led to his impeachment (although he was subsequently acquitted).","More than 20 years later, there’s talk of impeachment again following Ms Daniels’s attempt to overturn the 2016 agreement by which she agreed to keep silent about Mr Trump in return for $130,000.","If her court case is allowed to proceed, the President and his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen — who paid out the ‘hush money’ just ten days before the election — may have to testify in depositions.","It would be illegal under U.S. election law for the Trump business empire or his election campaign to have paid out for such a deal.

Mr Cohen has explained that he regularly used his business email for personal matters.","In fighting the attempt by the wily Stormy Daniels to slip out of the terms of her NDA, Team Trump faces another headache.","The NDA actually refers to Stormy Daniels not discussing a man called ‘David Dennison’ — not a Donald Trump. This was an alleged ploy to protect Mr Trump’s identity.","If the President doesn’t admit he is David Dennison, Daniels has a much stronger case to argue that she is not bound by the terms of the deal, and is free to go public about her claimed relationship with him.","But if Mr Trump does admit he’s Dennison, he will face questioning in court, and under oath, about whether he knew of the ‘hush payment’. His lawyer will, additionally, face questions as to why — under U.S. law — he didn’t inform his client of the agreeement.","An interview with Stormy Daniels is set to air on the CBS current affairs show 60 Minutes on March 25, although Mr Trump’s lawyers have threatened to stop it going out.","Meanwhile, a campaign finance watchdog group called Common Cause is arguing that the Daniels hush money was paid in service of Mr Trump’s presidential campaign because it bought silence on a controversy that could have hurt his prospects. If that’s so, it argues, then the payment could be an illegal undisclosed campaign contribution.","All in all. it’s a hugely complicated legal mess and, unfortunately for the President, it doesn’t even end there.","‘A lawsuit opens the door, and judges almost always allow for a plaintiff to have a “fishing” expedition,’ says Robert Bennett, the Washington lawyer who represented President Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones case.","Daniels will be entitled to ask all manner of unpleasant questions of Mr Trump and his lawyers, which they would be legally bound to answer truthfully. Mr Bennett says these questions would almost certainly include: ‘Have you paid other people money?’","In Michael Wolff’s controversial book, Fire And Fury, published late last year, the author quotes Steve Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist, as saying that another Trump lawyer [Marc Kasowitz] had got Mr Trump out of ‘all kinds of jams’ and ‘took care of’ 100 women during the campaign.","Kasowitz has dismissed Bannon’s reported remarks about him as ‘pure fiction’.","Other lawyers predict the Stormy Daniels lawsuit could easily be widened to address what one called the ‘wide array of Trump’s sexual interactions’.","Cue further Trump-bashing testimony from Karen McDougal, Jessica Drake, Alana Evans and possibly a posse of other women.","Some argue that, unlike other women accusers who have been silenced by Mr Trump’s dismissal of them as money-grabbing attention seekers, porn stars have no such sensitivity about their public image. They really don’t care what the President calls them. Stormy Daniels, currently revealing all on a ‘Make America Horny Again’ tour of U.S. strip clubs, is unashamedly out to grab as much money as she can from her notoriety.","Quite why the Trump camp is so desperate to silence her is perplexing many, given she’s already spilled the beans on what she insists happened between them.","In 2011, Daniels gave an interview to a celebrity magazine and passed a lie detector test that she was required to take beforehand.","The interview — held back for reasons unknown — was finally published two months ago and was hardly complimentary about the President.","They had ‘textbook generic sex’, Ms Daniels claimed, but Mr Trump — who called her ‘honeybunch’ — was a better conversationalist. ‘We had really good banter,’ she recalled. A photo on her social media page at the time showed them together at the Tahoe golfing event.","She said that Mr Trump evaded any questions about his wife Melania, telling her: ‘Oh, don’t worry about her.’","She went on: ‘He was sitting on the bed and he was like, “Come here.” And I was like, “Ugh, here we go”, and we started kissing.’","Daniels said she couldn’t even remember why she agreed to have sex with him, although she recalled thinking: ‘Please, don’t try to pay me.’","Afterwards, she says Mr Trump asked her to sign a copy of her latest comedy porn film, 3 Wishes.","Mr Trump became ‘smitten’ with her, she says, and would ring her every ten days, promising to put her on his show The Apprentice.","She said they continued to meet up, at Trump Tower in New York, at a Hollywood party and at the Miss USA pageant in Los Angeles.","Their affair really lasted just months, says Ms Daniels, but Mr Trump only stopped phoning her in 2010 — four years after they first met.","Meanwhile, Ms Daniels’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has been touring the TV studios this week, saying that he and his client will show that Mr Trump’s insistence that he had nothing to do with her hush agreement is ‘patently false’.","Mr Avenatti said that he has been approached by six other women with stories about the President similar to hers.","He also claimed that Ms Daniels had been physically threatened to stay silent about Mr Trump. He wouldn’t say by whom.","‘There’s the act and there’s the cover-up, and the American people are going to learn about both,’ he said of his client’s story.","The new allegations that Mr Trump had affairs prompted a slew of reports suggesting they had created a rift with his wife Melania.","Her spokesman decried a ‘laundry list of salacious and flat-out false reporting and said Melania was ‘focused on her family & role as FLOTUS [First Lady of the United States] — not the unrealistic scenarios being peddled daily by the fake news’.","Even so, it was reported that several hours after the New Yorker magazine published Miss McDougal’s story in February, Melania Trump conspicuously chose not to join her husband on the traditional walk across the White House lawn to the presidential helicopter.","Instead she was driven to the airport to board Air Force One and fly to Florida. Waiting media were ordered not to photograph her as she arrived.","How it all plays out remains to be seen, but there’s good reason to believe that a post-Harvey Weinstein America is less ready to tolerate tales of sexual misconduct by powerful men than it was during the election in 2016.","According to the latest data from the respected Pew Research Centre, enthusiasm for Mr Trump among white evangelical women — one of his core support groups — is slipping significantly. Porn stars appear to have been a factor.","With reports this week that Mr Trump plans to run for a second term under the slogan ‘Keep America Great’ — and even if the President and his lawyers can wriggle their way out of his latest legal nightmare — there may be a heavy price to pay at the ballot box in two years’ time."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

So unprecedented was this invasion of privacy, they argue, that action simply must be taken.","Only this sort of data collection and voter profiling isn't unprecedented at all; President Obama's re-election campaign was doing it in 2012. And Democrats and the media loved it.","The Obama campaign had no need for a third party organization like Cambridge Analytica to collect their data, either. Facebook itself worked with the campaign to help it gather information about users.","Carol Davidsen, the director of integration and media analytics for Obama for America, explained in a series of tweets:","According to Davidsen, Facebook itself realized what Team Obama was doing but \"didn't stop us once they realized what we were doing\" because \"they were on our side.\"","That is a stunning admission and undercuts the hard-line stance Facebook has taken with Cambridge Analytica. Is Facebook only upset about data mining now because it was done by a firm working for one of Facebook's political enemies? Facebook obviously had no problem with such activity when a political ally was engaging in it.","And neither did the media. Forbes notes that \"The New York Times praised the Obama campaign as 'digital masterminds' and lauded their 'unorthodox' approaches\" to advertising and voter targeting. Time Magazinepredicted that this approach would \"transform the way campaigns are conducted in the future.\"","In 2013, The New York Times explained what the Obama campaign did (with Facebook's explicit approval):","They started with a list that grew to a million people who had signed into the campaign Web site through Facebook. When people opted to do so, they were met with a prompt asking to grant the campaign permission to scan their Facebook friends lists, their photos and other personal information. In another prompt, the campaign asked for access to the users’ Facebook news feeds, which 25 percent declined, [engineer Will] St. Clair said.","Once permission was granted, the campaign had access to millions of names and faces they could match against their lists of persuadable voters, potential donors, unregistered voters and so on. “It would take us 5 to 10 seconds to get a friends list and match it against the voter list,” St. Clair said. They found matches about 50 percent of the time, he said. But the campaign’s ultimate goal was to deputize the closest Obama-supporting friends of voters who were wavering in their affections for the president. “We would grab the top 50 you were most active with and then crawl their wall” to figure out who were most likely to be their real-life friends, not just casual Facebook acquaintances. St. Clair, a former high-school marching-band member who now wears a leather Diesel jacket, explained: “We asked to see photos but really we were looking for who were tagged in photos with you, which was a really great way to dredge up old college friends — and ex-girlfriends,” he said.","The campaign’s exhaustive use of Facebook triggered the site’s internal safeguards. “It was more like we blew through an alarm that their engineers hadn’t planned for or knew about,” said St. Clair, who had been working at a small firm in Chicago and joined the campaign at the suggestion of a friend. “They’d sigh and say, ‘You can do this as long as you stop doing it on Nov. 7.’ ”","November 7th, of course, was the day after the 2012 presidential election. Facebook was allowing Team Obama to mine data so long as that data would be used in service to political ends of which Facebook approved.","In 2016, Cambridge Analytica employed what appears to be a nearly identical system of data mining and voter targeting in service of two political movements--the Brexit and Donald Trump campaigns--of which Facebook disapproves, and now Facebook is feigning outrage.","So too are Democrats and media members condemning the exact same behavior they spent much of the 2012 election cycle applauding.","Dan O'Donnell","Common Sense Central is edited by WISN's Dan O'Donnell.

Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn’t authorized to have that information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded the app and shared their personal details with it, Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information that it received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports “several days ago” that not all the data was deleted.","Advertisement","While it investigates the matter, Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; the academic who created the app in question, a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received the user data from the app.","Exactly why the handling of this data warranted both suspension and Facebook’s unusual public explanation of the move wasn’t clear. The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the “public prominence” of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an “unacceptable violation of trust” and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties “responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.”","In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied any wrongdoing. He said the parent company’s SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake “a large-scale research project in the U.S.,” but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan’s company. For the “avoidance of doubt,” the spokesman said, none of Kogan’s data was used in Cambridge Analytica’s 2016 election work.","Advertisement","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Senator Ted Cruz and the Trump general-election campaign.","The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica’s role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","But the company has also surfaced a few times during the probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. For instance, Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation after pleading guilty to a felony charge, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the Hillary Clinton campaign. Nix said Assange said no. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes. Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.","Facebook’s share values plummeted immediately after the FTC announced its probe, but they rebounded later in the day, closing up a fraction of a point on a day when the overall market rose about 3 percent.","However, public opinion toward the company has not bounced back so easily, and the #deleteFacebook trend has continued to gain momentum. The movement even gained the support of WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who sold his company to Facebook for roughly $19 billion in 2014.","Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) finally broke his silence on the Cambridge Analytica scandal last week, saying that Facebook must “step up” and address its failures. “We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward,” Zuckerberg said.","Facebook denies logging calls and messages — sort of","Facebook eventually owned up to Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of user data, but the company has denied the more recent reports that it has been logging users’ call and SMS history without their permission. “This is not the case,” Facebook said in a statement.","To be clear, Facebook does actually log user calls and SMS history on its mobile apps, but the company has rejected the “without permission” element of last week’s reports.","“Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook,” Facebook said in its statement. “People have to expressly agree to use this feature.”","Although Facebook’s call logging feature is opt-in, the prompt given to users during installation offers a seemingly innocuous explanation for what the feature does. The prompt also features “TURN ON” as the more prominent choice, while the easily missed “NOT NOW” is displayed in the same faded gray color as the rest of the text. With the number of people who skip past terms-of-service agreements without ever reading them, it is possible that many users have the call logging feature turned unbeknownst to them.","Facebook assured users that it will never sell the data it has gathered from this feature, and the company noted that the feature “does not collect the content of your text messages or calls.” Facebook also said users can disable the logging feature at any time, which will delete “all previously shared call and text history shared via that app.”","Images: Facebook","Since you’re here …","… We’d like to tell you about our mission and how you can help us fulfill it.

{"originalurl":"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbxgzb/cambridge-analytica-facebook-ad-targeting-third-party-apps","title":"Cambridge Analytica's Ad Targeting Is the Reason Facebook Exists - Motherboard","text":["Cambridge Analytica's Ad Targeting Is the Reason Facebook Exists","Thousands of third party apps were designed solely to obtain and sell your data. It's no surprise that the data ended up being used again on Facebook, one of the biggest advertising platforms on Earth.","This weekend, while Facebook was quibbling about whether the information used by Cambridge Analytica to target voters in the lead up to the 2016 election was obtained in a data “breach” or somehow using fraudulent means, I decided to check my privacy settings.","Since creating a Facebook in 2006, I have associated my account with 100 separate third party apps. Besides common ones like Spotify, Venmo, and Uber, I have given access to my account to apps like “Typing Maniac,” “I bet I can guess your favorite color,” and “Crazy Cabbie,” among others. Many of these apps I remember only as a faint memory. According to these settings, however, lots of these apps still have access to the same information Cambridge Analytica used to target Facebook users with political ads that helped Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election.","The app was hosted by a company called MetroGames, whose privacy policy notes that the company “may also collect information about the User from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, [and] instant messaging services.” The privacy policy says it shared identifying personal information with third parties only when “permitted by the User” but also said that it used anonymized data regardless of a user’s settings: “We do this primarily for personalizing advertisements and promotions. We regard this as a benefit for the User.”","I do not know what MetroGames—which has gone out of business—ultimately did with my data. But between the hundred apps I’ve given access to my Facebook, there’s a good chance at least one of them has sold my information to data brokers and ultimately used to target me on Facebook and elsewhere. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment for this article.","“You have to proceed on the assumption that this information has been extracted from you,” Woodrow Hartzog, author of Privacy’s Blueprint: The Battle to Control the Design of New Technologies, told me on the phone. “Cambridge Analytica used an information extraction technique that was well-known to technologists for years. The implications of this debacle is about crystallizing the threat about how dangerous the information ecosystem is.”","Just some of the apps that have access to at least some of my information. Image: Jason Koebler/Facebook","The point I am trying to make is that, though Cambridge Analytica’s specific use of user data to help a political campaign is something we haven’t publicly seen on this scale before, it is exactly the type of use that Facebook’s platform is designed for, has facilitated for years, and continues to facilitate every day. At its core, Facebook is an advertising platform that makes almost all of its money because it and the companies that use its platform know so much about you.","Facebook continues to be a financially successful company precisely because its platform has enabled the types of person-specific targeting that Cambridge Analytica did.","Though Facebook technically asks apps not to sell user information to data brokers, researchers say that enforcement is rare and that many fly-by-night companies have historically popped up, gathered information, and then sold that data (or sold the entire company itself) to marketing firms and data brokers. It would be difficult for Facebook to even know this was happening, and many companies would simply be kicked off Facebook once it had already harvested data.","Facebook partners with data brokers to help make its information more effective. Image: Jason Koebler","The way Cambridge Analytica obtained the data of millions of Americans has been done—and in many ways is still being done—by many different data broker firms throughout the United States and the world. The same data that is used every day to sell shoes and meditation apps is used to sell us political candidates, too. Whether Cambridge Analytica misused the data or obtained it in some nefarious way is beside the point—thousands of apps have been used to gather information about millions of Facebook users, and there is little stopping them from selling that data to other people.","“I think there should be concern about other apps engaging in digital strip mining,” Hartzog said. “They create a generic type of app that might be somewhat appealing to users, they get as much information as they can, and they get out. There’s a huge incentive to get the data, and there’s not much penalty for doing it. Not from Facebook and not within our legal structure.”","Cambridge Analytica got much of its data from a Facebook personality test called “thisisyourdigitallife” that was much like many of the games I and millions of other people signed up for years ago. These types of apps were trojan horses to gain access to profiles that could then be resold.","This was not incidental, it was the business model of the apps. I ultimately don’t know if MetroGames sold my data, but many similar apps were created and were eventually purchased by marketing firms and data brokers.","\"People were writing apps manically—photo of the day, quizzes, any sort of garbage people would install so you would have a big user base to take the data. And there were absolutely cases where people developed Facebook apps for fun, got a huge user base, and then sold the apps for hundreds of thousands of dollars to a marketing company.\"","In this way, companies were not technically breaking their privacy policies—by purchasing Facebook app companies, the “third party” data brokers suddenly because the first-party owners of the data. For example, a data analytics company called RapLeaf was caught purchasing user information from various Facebook apps. Facebook eventually shut down RapLeaf, but the company simply sold itself to two data brokers, Acxiom and Tower Data. Today, Acxiom is a “Facebook Marketing Partner” which allows would-be advertisers to supplement that information they already have with the data that Acxiom has already gathered.","“Once Facebook created the [data sharing] API, there was a land grab,” Christo Wilson, a researcher at Northeastern University who has studied Facebook advertising and third-party data sharing tactics, told me on the phone. “People were writing apps manically—photo of the day, quizzes, any sort of garbage people would install so you would have a big user base to take the data. It was a huge market back in the day. And there were absolutely cases where people developed Facebook apps for fun, got a huge user base, and then sold the apps for hundreds of thousands of dollars to a marketing company.”","Granting an app access to your Facebook profile gave it a “token” that could then be used—in many cases indefinitely—by the app to access your data, according to Wilson.","Wilson said that in the course of their research, he and colleague Alan Mislove created apps to determine what types of information could be harvested by data brokers and advertisers; that “thisisyourdigitallife” was nominally created for academic research ultimately has no bearing on what data was collected and how it was ultimately used. Thousands of other apps have harvested the same data.","“You told us you had 100 apps installed—you’re not the only one,” Wilson said. “I have restrictions on my behavior because of things like institutional review, but 99.9 percent of these apps were commercial for the purposes of monetizing people.”","An API change in 2015 made data sharing more restrictive—Facebook no longer allowed apps to take your data simply because your friend had installed an app—but third party apps could still collect data directly from your profile if you gave them permission. And because of the way Facebook’s advertising products work, once data was taken, it remained valuable to data brokers, who collate and compile information for advertisers. Much of the damage is already done.","\"The incentive is to extract every iota of value out of users\"","Data brokers create databases of information that’s pulled from Facebook and elsewhere. And once taken off the platform, data can be analyzed and re-imported later to be used to target people. Facebook allows advertisers to upload .CSV spreadsheets of information about people and use that information to specifically target people using its “Custom Audiences” product. That data can then be further used to target “Lookalike Audiences” on Facebook—people that data brokers might not know much about but who Facebook itself does know a lot about, according to Mislove.","Facebook’s partnerships with data brokers like Acxiom and Experian allow advertisers to leverage what Facebook knows about you with what data brokers know about you to create a more complex profile of who you are.","Together, Facebook and data brokers have made a list of things that it thinks I like, based on my likes, my apps, my web behavior, and, crutially, what data brokers already know about me. It also creates a rough profile of who I am:","Facebook knows I live away from my family, my political leanings, that I travel often, that I use an iPhone 7 Plus, and much more information. Image: Jason Koebler/Facebook","“If I was Cambridge Analytica, I would have taken 50 million users worth of data, crunched the numbers and figured out who was susceptible to influence,” Mislove said. “Then I’d upload that data back to Facebook as a custom audience and ask Facebook for lookalikes of those people, who are new people I didn’t know about but who are susceptible.”","When I signed up for these hundred apps years ago, I generally had two choices: Accept the terms, or not play the game. In recent years, Facebook has allowed for greater, app-specific privacy setting control, but the fact remains that Facebook makes its money by selling advertisements, and those advertisements are more valuable to companies—and Facebook—because Facebook and the companies it works with can target you, specifically.","Though Facebook has made a few changes to make privacy control better, that basic calculus has not changed, and the old adage still applies: If you’re not paying for something, you are the product.","“The incentive is to extract every iota of value out of users,” Hartzog said. “The service is built around those incentives. You have to convince people to share as much information as possible so you click on as many ads as possible and then feel good about doing it. This is the operating ethos for the entire social internet.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Until now changing settings had been complex, spread over at least 20 screens, which had frustrated users.","A Facebook logo reflected in the eye of a woman is seen in this picture illustration","The world’s largest social network said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users’ anger over how the company uses their data and as lawmakers around the globe called for strong regulation.","\"Last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies and help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,\" Facebook wrote in the blog post on Wednesday.","Facebook’s shares were up 1.2 percent at US$154 on Wednesday. They are still down almost 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled via a third-party app to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers – Facebook’s lifeblood – and lead to tougher regulation.","Analysts said the revamps Facebook rolled out on Wednesday looked more like tweaks than big changes, making data management more transparent rather than changing the way the company does business.","\"It doesn’t seem that the changes that have been proposed are particularly meaningful,\" Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. \"There are several problems and one needs to address operationally what Facebook is doing to provide confidence that personal data is protected.\"","Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers’ access to user information.","The changes Facebook announced on Wednesday let users add more layers of protection, control what they share and delete it if they want to, control the ads they see, and manage who sees their posts and profile information.","There is also a new page – Access Your Information – where users can see the information they’ve shared and manage it.","\"The biggest difference is ease of access in settings, which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg’s promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users,\" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.","It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers.","They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May. It requires companies to give people a \"right to portability\" – to take their data with them – and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law.","Lawmakers in the United States are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users’ data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.","He plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators.","Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board.","The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","Tony Romm contributed to this report.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Now. - The Washington Post","text":["Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg need to come clean about 2016. Now.","Over the weekend, the New York Times and the Observer of London posted a blockbuster investigative piece revealing that Cambridge Analytica, the firm brought on by the Trump campaign to target voters online, used the data of tens of millions of people obtained from Facebook without proper disclosures or permission.","In the wake of this report, it’s more than past time for Mark Zuckerberg to testify to Congress about Facebook’s role in the 2016 elections and why he believes existing privacy laws are adequate to protect Americans from misuse and abuse of technology platforms.","And I mean Mark Zuckerberg. Not a Facebook lawyer, like the one the company sent to Congress last year for hearings on how fake news swamped tech platforms such as, oh, Facebook. As Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) tweeted:","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The investigation published by the Times revealed that Cambridge Analytica, after receiving $15 million from conservative donor Robert Mercer in 2014 to micro-target voters, obtained the information to do so in a questionable way. A British professor collected the information from Facebook, saying he was conducting an academic personality study. He did get the approval of about 270,000 people who signed up to take part in the study — they were told their information would be used. He did not, however, get the permission of the users’ friends, whose information was also gathered — an estimated 50 million people.","It’s not just that such an action is unethical. It might well be a violation of an agreement Facebook made with the federal government. Two former employees of the Federal Trade Commission have now told The Post that it’s quite possible that Facebook violated a 2011 agreement with the agency to notify and offer users an out when there is an effort to use their personal information in a way not in line with their privacy settings. This agreement was reached after consumer groups complained that Facebook was cavalier with personal information.","So back to Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook found out, courtesy of a 2015 piece in the Guardian, that Cambridge Analytica and British academics had information on many users that agreed to such a collection, it demanded the information be destroyed. This did not happen. Facebook cited this when pressed on the latest revelations by the Times, claiming that the companies that misused the data “certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","(On Monday afternoon, Facebook announced that Cambridge Analytica agreed to a digital audit to prove it destroyed the disputed materials. The professors involved in using the data also agreed to an audit.)","And so, after the Times published its piece, Facebook didn’t own up to what happened. Instead, Facebook executives have gotten into a multiplespats with reporters and others over whether the Cambridge Analytica incident is a “breach” or a mere misuse of personal information, since some (but not all!) the people whose data was involved did give permission for their data to be taken and the company was not actually hacked. Facebook’s motive for this is almost certainly legal and regulatory. As Bloomberg News notes, a “breach” is a specific term that requires the company to notify users their information was illegally accessed.","But there is quite possibly a bigger motive. Painting Cambridge Analytica as the villain is an attempt to get Facebook off the hook for its ongoing role in everything from other invasions of privacy (more about that in a moment) to the ongoing complaints about its role in spreading fake news in the 2016 elections. If one or two rogue companies such as Cambridge Aanlytica — and not Facebook — are responsible for this mass misuse of data, perhaps the company can say more regulation is not needed.","But don’t fall for the idea that Facebook is not the problem. This is hardly a first-time offense for Facebook, which — a reminder — allowed fake news to flood many users’ news feeds in the months leading up to the 2016 elections.","In fact, Washington perhaps should have gotten interested in Facebook well before the Trump election contretemps. Over time, Facebook has indulged in numerous instances of dodgy behavior. There was the time Facebook altered news feeds to study whether they could affect the mood of people on the platform. There was the reveal that its platform permitted ad buyers to target people with such delightful terms as “jew hater.” And the discovery that Facebook made it possible to target housing ads to whites only.","Whether this latest scandal was a breach or a misuse of information is irrelevant. It was wrong. Zuckerberg needs to explain — slowly and clearly and without legal terminology or whiny excuses — what went wrong at the company he founded in his Harvard dorm room, and what steps the company is taking to make sure it never happens again. My suspicion? He can’t do that. Instead, a Zuckerberg appearance will demonstrate the need for significant federal regulation of large technology platforms. No wonder it hasn’t happened yet.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","Helaine OlenHelaine Olen is a contributor to the PostPartisan blog and the author of \"Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry.\" Her work has appeared in Slate, the Nation, the New York Times, the Atlantic and many other publications.

We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","It's the latest twist in an ongoing saga about the goings-on in the run-up to and during the 2016 US presidential elections. Intelligence chiefs said in January that the Russian government used social media to spread information during the election to help Trump defeat rival candidate Hillary Clinton. Several tech companies, including Twitter and Google, have faced criticism for failing to curb the spread of \"fake news\" on its platforms, and allowing Russian-backed trolls to buy ads to spread misinformation on their platforms.","But this latest discovery of massive data harvesting and how it was used will raise fresh questions about Facebook's involvement in targeting voters during the election.","According to the whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who was also suspended from the social network, Kogan provided data on over 50 million profiles to the company.","That figure is far higher than Facebook's estimate of over a quarter-million accounts, which the company claims consented to having their data taken.","For its part, Cambridge Analytica in a statement denied many of the allegations made against the company. The company said when it learned that the data \"had not been obtained\" by the academic researcher in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted \"all data\" that it received.","\"No data from [the academic researcher] was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" the statement added.","The UK's Information Commissioner's Office, charged with upholding data protection and privacy rights, said that it is now \"investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used.\"","Officials at the UK Electoral Commission are also said to be investigating what involvement Cambridge Analytica had in the \"Brexit\" referendum in 2016.","The reaction to the case has been strong.","Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) called the online political advertising market the \"Wild West.\"","\"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,\" he said, calling for lawmakers to pass stronger legislation.","Nuala O'Connor, the president of Washington DC-based non-profit Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT), said it's now \"a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide.\"","\"While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways,\" said O'Connor.","Exactly what the fallout is from the incident is yet to be fully known. What looks like yet another case of foreign actors using Facebook to influence the outcome of an election isn't something the social networking giant can walk away from easily.","Facebook cutting off the data supply at the source is a start, but for many it's too little, too late.","Thank You","By registering you become a member of the CBS Interactive family of sites and you have read and agree to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Video Services Policy.

Here's the wild story of how she convinced thousands to believe her dangerous science, and how a grassroots movement shut her down when Facebook wouldn't.","When Bruce Wilmot decided to go on “Jilly Juice” last summer, he’d just learned that his pancreatic cancer was back, and it was bad. He’d been through the hell of chemo before, and the last thing he wanted was more treatment.","“My dad was really desperate,” Taylor Wilmot, his daughter, told BuzzFeed News. “He was very sad, and he didn’t want to die.”","Then 55 and living alone in Columbus, Georgia, he stumbled across the Facebook group of Jillian Mai Thi Epperly, a woman from Canton, Ohio, whose tens of thousands of followers swore by her bizarre, dangerous, and entirely made-up science theory: that all diseases — including cancer — are caused by a fungus called candida that lives in the gut.","Jamie Jansen","Jillian Mai Thi Epperly","As Epperly claimed on the group — called Exposing the Lies Candida: Weaponized Fungus Mainstreaming Mutancy — candida attracts parasites, and the only way to health is a severely restricted diet accompanied by large quantities of her signature fermented cabbage juice. Her potion was a purgative, and she said that “healing symptoms” included nausea, headaches, dizziness, and explosive blasts of diarrhea. These “waterfalls” supposedly brought out the parasites, which were visible in the toilet bowl.","For Wilmot, things moved swiftly downhill after his diagnosis. The doctor had given him a few weeks, maybe a few months, according to his rabbi, Brian Hawkins, who told BuzzFeed News he was with Wilmot when he was diagnosed. But within just days, Wilmot found it hard to get around, and a hospice facility sent a bed to his duplex.","“I've been juicing like crazy, Cancer bad juice good,” he wrote in a Facebook post on June 13. “Ime [sic] brewing up some of Jillian Mai Thi's protocol and plan on switching completely over to her diet, ferment etc. as soon as that is ready.” Friends wrote comments of encouragement and said they were praying for him.","Epperly, whom Wilmot had tagged, also replied: “You are amazing If you need a short chat later let me know You will pull through.”","“I might take you up on that,” Wilmot said.","A few days later, friends visited his condo to help make a huge batch of the juice. They followed the recipe described in documents posted on Epperly’s Facebook group: Add a tablespoon of pink Himalayan salt to two cups of water and two cups of cabbage or kale. Puree in a blender, pour into a glass jar, cover, and leave at room temperature to ferment for three days. Drink a few cups nightly — up to a gallon a day.","Rabbi Hawkins, who had become Wilmot's religious guide and friend in those final months, remembered hearing about the cabbage juice. \"If someone had bottled up rat poison and told him, ‘It will heal you,’ he would have drunk it,” Hawkins told BuzzFeed News. “That’s how desperate the man was.”","When Taylor came back to visit her father a few weeks later, she was shocked. “He was totally emaciated,” she said. “He was drinking so much of it, he was basically starving himself. It was all coming out as diarrhea.”","In mid-July, Wilmot's friends found him unconscious on the floor of his apartment, and he was moved to a hospice facility. On July 20, about a month after he was diagnosed and began the juice purge, he died.","Facebook is under scrutiny for its outsized role in spreading political misinformation. But it’s also a platform where pseudoscience, snake oil remedies, and medical falsehoods multiply unchecked. Those have received far less attention, despite carrying the potential for immediate physical harm.","There are countless fake science gurus with large Facebook followings. But Epperly’s is particularly striking, according to Tim Caulfield, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Alberta, because she’s not a celebrity. “She isn’t associated with some well-packaged brand, so it’s interesting that she’s able to accumulate this much interest.”","She says her cabbage concoction will reverse illness, arrest aging, and even turn gay people straight.","Epperly is also notable for the stark absurdity of her theory. She says her cabbage concoction will reverse all forms of illness, arrest aging, and even turn gay people straight. These claims are “absolutely dangerous nonsense,” David Seres, director of medical nutrition at Columbia University’s Irving Medical Center, told BuzzFeed News. “I am almost speechless.”","Epperly has no background in medicine or science. She delivers elements of her theory in rambling videos beamed live from her home. They have an unvarnished reality-TV quality to them: Epperly is often in a T-shirt, hair up, walking through the house as she talks. She is also a prolific Facebook commenter, each missive a stream-of-consciousness word salad. And for $70 an hour, she told BuzzFeed News, she will provide personal phone consultations, talking people through her theory and how to make the recipe.","When asked why she presents wild theories with no evidence to back them up, Epperly likened her efforts to a religious conversion. She doesn’t worry, she said, about people who don’t believe.","“We’re using a different context in my world, and the manifestations from the salt and the accessing of the nutrients is gonna give you a different context of what the symptoms are,” Epperly said. “So essentially what it is, is we’re trying to turn an atheist into a Christian.”","More than a dozen people told BuzzFeed News that they complained to Facebook about Epperly and her group, to no avail. The company has fairly lax rules for dealing with pseudoscientific groups. “We remove content, disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety,” according to its community standards.","For example, in January the platform removed videos promoting the Tide Pod Challenge after people began posting videos eating (or pretending to eat) laundry detergent.","But Epperly’s group did not violate Facebook’s rules, a company spokesperson told BuzzFeed News, and so was not taken down. The company wants to encourage discussion among its users, the spokesperson added, and does not want to censor provocative ideas. Facebook refused to discuss Wilmot’s death with BuzzFeed News on the record.","Sometimes, perhaps most of the time, Facebook’s relaxed policy means that people making wild health claims — like Joseph Mercola, “Food Babe” Vani Hari, or the makers of the “FasciaBlaster” who injured women with a device that promised to zap cellulite — can thrive. But in Epperly’s case, something unusual happened: Some Facebook users decided to take matters into their own hands.","Motivated in part by Wilmot's death, about a dozen private satellite Facebook groups — the biggest has over 10,000 members — have emerged with the explicit purpose of taking her down. This countermovement has organized to contact journalists, law enforcement, and the Ohio Medical Board about Epperly’s dangerous ideas — and prompted a response from the Ohio Attorney General.","But whether their efforts will make any dent in Epperly’s business — or change Facebook’s stance on enabling fake science — is still very much an open question.","Via JenLeigh5 / Photobucket","Screenshots from Epperly's Facebook group, as collected by her critics.","Epperly lays out her personal history in a 106-page book she self-published on Google Drive. She was born in Vietnam, arrived in the US before she turned 2, and was adopted by American parents.","Growing up in the Bay Area, her father worked in biotech, and she points to this as the source of her insider knowledge that the pharmaceutical industry is a scam. She is against vaccines, and presents an argument that’s common among anti-vaxxers: that Big Pharma is in cahoots with doctors to keep Americans sick and addicted to medication. “I realized that vaccines are just one way to inject pollution into a human body,” she wrote.","After bouncing around for college — Epperly told BuzzFeed News she did not graduate — she helped sell insurance. She developed premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Because it kept her away from work once a month, she said, she had a hard time holding down a job.","She met her husband online, then moved to Ohio to live with him. In their first years together he worked as a trucker and she would travel cross-country with him, listening to radio pundits and conspiracy theorists, like InfoWars founder Alex Jones.","“I was exposed to the anti-vaxx community, the chemtrail community,” Epperly said. Looking for alternate ways to treat her PMDD, she said, “I tried every single detox, pill, powder, supplement, that I had access to, and joined millions of groups that were all promoting their wares.”","She also dabbled in fermentation, trying recipes for kombucha and for pickles. At some point, she decided to swap cucumbers for cabbage, and upped the spoons of salt in the brew. That was the genesis for her theory.","In parallel, Epperly said, she was researching various diseases online, and noticed that candida or other fungi were “always a factor.” Some alternative medicine websites claim (falsely) that yeast in the human gut can bloom and overwhelm the body if it is exposed to the wrong food or chemical. Epperly just amped up that idea, implicating the fungus as the ultimate cause of any and all illness.","Epperly made kale and cabbage versions of her Jilly Juice for the first time in October 2016. By January 2017, she was posting video demos on her personal Facebook page, attracting dozens of comments. She said that her fans convinced her to create a private Facebook group, which quickly grew over the next few months to include thousands of people.","Epperly said that the group was something of a laboratory: She’d watch how “the protocol” affected her followers, and based on their responses, she’d update her ideas. For example, a key aspect of her theory — that the fermented cabbage juice expels parasites that live in the digestive system — only came about after she saw people’s photos of their bowel movements.","“I wasn't aware of parasites in the beginning,” she told BuzzFeed News. “The group actually was a research tool, a database tool, to share what they were passing. And I’m like, Oh my god. That’s coming out of you in waterfalls?”","Many foods — sugars, legumes, grains, anything processed, and all meat except chicken — fed the parasites, she said. Constipation did too. Poop and its passing became a pillar of Epperly’s dictum.","“We are in a poop cult,” she joked in one video, and a post on her Facebook page. “You know why? Because we’re realizing that poop is one of the main things that is feeding the candida and the worms and the parasites.”","As her following grew, her theory stretched from the digestive system to sexual preferences. “Is our society ready to accept that gay lesbian and transgender is a mutation of the human body,” she wrote in one post.","When asked to elaborate on this, Epperly told BuzzFeed News by email: “I've had gay people say that their intention is to reverse her health issues but not change their sexual leanings and that is completely fine and they may find that in the process of reversing their health issues it may change their sexual desires so it's all a possibility.”","She was amazed by what she saw: Members posted photos of their toilet bowls like they were trophies. Commenters earnestly read the blobs and streaks like tea leaves, pointing out what they thought were tapeworms, fungi, and parasites, and congratulating the posters on taking steps toward better health. Every few days, Epperly herself would appear via a livestream from her home.","“I started watching people drinking it, and using it as an enema, and giving it to babies and children.”","Burns’ curiosity quickly turned to anger. “I started watching people drinking it, and using it as an enema, and giving it to babies and children,” she said.","In one video a member had posted, Burns said, a toddler drank a concoction of Epperly’s recipe. “I was just like, ‘Are you serious?’”","Burns looked on Facebook for others who shared her alarm, and found a (now-defunct) group called “Exposing the lies of jillian mai thi & her protocol,” in which people railed against Epperly. Burns kept watching posts in Epperly’s group and began documenting developments regularly.","Aeryale Thomas, a 37-year-old from Grand Rapids, Michigan, founded a similar private group, “Death By Salt: Mainstreaming The Mai Thi Experiment,” last year. She told BuzzFeed News that she was also alarmed that kids were consuming the fermented cabbage juice.","“What caught my eye was a parent putting the protocol, the juice, in a feeding tube of a child that was very sick,” she said. “No one was saying, ‘This is a bad idea.’”","Epperly's opponents marked up a screenshot from her Facebook group allegedly showing the diaper of a baby who had been fed the protocol.","Thomas said she messaged the mother, but the woman blocked her and did not respond. Still, Thomas said she felt she had to warn strangers about buying into Epperly’s fake health claims. “I don’t know these people, but it’s still like watching a child get hit by a car,” Thomas said.","Convinced that poorly fermented products could be making people ill, and that the salt content in the mixture was also bad news, Thomas said that she and several other women began screenshotting posts by Epperly and her followers and posting them in their own group.","“I feel compelled to retain this information just in case something does happen and the authorities need some kind of reference, a reference point,” Thomas told BuzzFeed News.","Epperly told BuzzFeed News that she believes that infants can benefit from drinking the juice in addition to breast milk. She added that, “a baby could potentially live on this along with coconut oil and be fine, and would be able to flourish and grow because they’re getting access to nutrients.“ (Epperly also claimed that Thomas is a “proponent” of giving pregnant women kratom, a plant with some opioid properties. Thomas told BuzzFeed News that she is in a Facebook group about kratom, and she believes the plant may be a better alternative to painkillers.)","By the fall of last year, when word got out that Bruce Wilmot had died, Epperly addressed the tragedy in a video she posted on her Facebook page. In the video, she claimed that she had spoken to Wilmot about how and when to drink the juice. The reason things went wrong, she explained, was that he didn’t take enough of it.","“He stopped. I told him, cut back a little bit if the symptoms get too much — but he really shouldn’t have. He really should have kept going,” she said.","In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Epperly doubled down on this idea, saying Wilmot had not been “aggressive” enough in following her protocol, and speculating that his death could have also been helped along by his medications, the pineapple juice he drank, or the medical system.","“Nobody looks for my protocol when they are completely 100% well and happy,” she said.","Wilmot’s daughter Taylor watched the video from her home in California a few months after he died. “That really hurt my heart,” she told BuzzFeed News. She found the video after someone had tried to recruit her into the movement to destroy Epperly’s Facebook stronghold. “I was shocked that there was a whole group of people who believed that my dad had died from this,” she said.","She joined several of the opposition groups and wrote a public post describing her dad’s experience. She hoped that people who were thinking about starting Epperly’s protocol would find her note and change their minds.","News of Wilmot’s death enraged Epperly’s critics. By fall, the handful of anti-Epperly groups had multiplied to almost a dozen. (Burns launched her own “anti-juice” splinter group with this stated goal: “We want to take Jillian off Facebook! At least take the children and babies off of this protocol!” It now has more than 420 members.)","“It’s like spy vs. spy,” she said. “I mean, it’s a war of information.”","But Epperly’s group grew too. Ann Kennedy, a 42-year-old from the Columbus suburbs, told BuzzFeed News she joined the group in late 2017, after she saw a friend post about the protocol.","Kennedy had been a dental assistant for a decade and was outraged by the claims. “It was like, whoa, is this real life?” Once in the group, she realized that thousands of people were convinced it was real.","“I joined every anti-Jillian group I could,” Kennedy said. Almost immediately, she was kicked out of Epperly’s group — evidently, Epperly’s followers had covertly joined the opposition forums and spotted her.","Epperly told BuzzFeed News that she knows some of her followers joined anti-juice groups to keep tabs on her critics, but said she didn’t ask or pay them to.","“It’s like spy vs. spy,” she said. “I mean, it’s a war of information.”","Bruce Wilmot / Via Facebook","Wilmot's jars of Jilly Juice.","Over the past few months, the thousands-strong anti-Epperly movement — on Facebook and elsewhere — has taken real-world actions against her.","In October, an anonymous author created a (now-private) blog and posted systematic and lengthy takedowns of Epperly’s claims, including annotated screenshots of Facebook posts. In a YouTube library, someone catalogued snippets of Epperly’s Facebook videos — proof of her claims in case she shut down her account. A Change.org petition (with 809 signatures as of February) called for Epperly to be banned from Facebook and all social media. In the private anti-Epperly group “Cabbotaging Children & Pets: Reporting Jillian Mai Thi Epperly,” a Google document listed contact information for state and federal law enforcement, attorneys general, and medical boards.","Another group pooled their screenshots and saved them on the photo-sharing site Photobucket, organized in folders by theme, archived in case Epperly’s Facebook group disappeared. (The person behind that account told BuzzFeed News that she spent 25 hours over two weeks working on it.) Jeff Holiday, a 35-year-old from Oregon who makes YouTube videos skewering scammy science, produced a three-part series on Epperly, racking up about 47,000 views in total.","Andrew Stewart, a 32-year-old from Minnesota, joined Epperly’s group in November, after hearing about it on an anti-vaxx group he was trolling. Between jobs, living alone, with time on his hands, he drafted a letter to the Ohio Attorney General’s Office in late December, requesting that the office consider criminal charges against Epperly.","“I would like to ask that the office of the Ohio Attorney General without delay investigate this matter and use every legal option to make this woman stop, and furthermore consider criminal charges,” he wrote. “She is an inherent threat to the safety of others and what she is doing is neither legal nor by any standard morally sound at all.”","A few days later, the AG’s office replied to Stewart, referring him to the state medical board. Over the next few weeks, Stewart said, he also contacted the State of Ohio Medical Board, the criminal investigations division at the FDA, and Interpol.","“I didn't want her to go somewhere she could be immune to prosecution,” Stewart told BuzzFeed News.","Kennedy, meanwhile, filed a complaint with the Ohio Medical Board, asserting that Epperly was dispensing medical advice without a license.","She also turned her efforts online. “I googled ‘cults,’” she remembered, looking for ways to take down organized groups led by scam artists. She tried a local news station in Ohio, but they didn’t bite. She stopped short of calling the police. “I just couldn’t imagine calling the police department and saying these things,” she said. “I feared that they would want to come find me and take me away.”","According to Epperly, others have gone to more extreme lengths. She said she has received spoofed phone calls that appeared to originate from the police department, or the humane society, or the Ohio AG’s office.","Someone told Facebook that Epperly’s husband was dead, so the company turned his profile into a memorial page. (It has since been turned back.) Once, she said, wings and pizzas arrived at her house from an anonymous sender who hadn’t paid for them.","For $30 annually, or $5 monthly, readers could become part of Epperly’s “growing virtual community.”","Epperly said she decided to turn her group from public to private for the sake of her moderators, who were also receiving messages from the anti-juice crowd by email and on Facebook.","By the new year, Epperly had had enough of her haters. She put her group on lockdown — no one but moderators could make new posts — and trimmed the membership by about 1,000 members, according to a message she shared with the remaining group.","Epperly explained that she would launch an independent website and host her following there instead of Facebook. She said that the group had become too large, and that her trolls had become too much of a nuisance. “I left the platform because I have people being targeted,“ she told BuzzFeed News. “I've actually had people who were visited by [Child Protective Services] and had to get a note from their doctor to allow them to feed their baby or their child this recipe.”","Jillyjuice.com launched on Feb. 5. Epperly wrote on the homepage: “I have a protocol to reverse 100% all of your health issues from A-Z forever vaccinated or not, except for major organ transplant patients and surrogate mothers until they bring the baby to term!!”","For $30 annually, or $5 monthly, readers could become part of Epperly’s “growing virtual community.” She spent the next couple of weeks explaining to the Facebook group which modes of payment she could and couldn’t take (from credit card and bank transfers to checks mailed to a P.O. box in Canton, Ohio) and posting daily reminders that she would be shutting down the 58,000-member page soon.","Not everyone was happy with the move away from Facebook, but Epperly dismissed them. When group members asked if she would keep her website free, she balked.","“I’m not going to put up with somebody sniveling about how they can’t afford to pay for my site which is only $30 a year which is Pennies on the dollar and believe me if people want to know this information they will find a way to move Heaven and Earth and those who snivel and talk about how poor they are they just need to do the recipe and drink and drink,” she wrote.","Via JenLeigh5 / Photobucket","Screenshots, as collected by Epperly's critics, of \"The List\" of rules for people new to her group.","In mid-February, just as Epperly had promised, the Facebook group vanished. She told BuzzFeed News that she purged the group of almost all its members, but keeps the archives so she can see old posts when she wants to.","The move did not seem to deter the anti-juice movement. The week the Facebook group disappeared, Thomas of Michigan launched her own anti-juice website, and also submitted a complaint to the Ohio Attorney General’s Office, noting that “jillyjuice.com is soliciting donations for medical advice,” according to the complaint provided to BuzzFeed News by the attorney general.","This time, instead of dismissing the complaint, the AG’s complaint specialist, Anne Davis, told Thomas and Epperly to talk to each other to try to reach an amicable resolution.","Instead, Epperly wrote an email to Davis claiming she was “a victim of internet bullying no different than dealing with a school yard bully.” She explained that she had set up the website and its paywalled forum to ward off such “evil and malicious” attacks. And she repeated her claim that her protocol could “potentially reverse Cancer, disease and chronic illness using liquefied sauerkraut.”","Thomas, meanwhile, asked Epperly in an email to disavow the “healing” and “reversing” claims that she had made, and in particular to stop recommending that people feed the salty fermented brew to children. “There are many people who have done your Protocol, both long-term, and short-term, and have drunk the 'jillyjuice' — only to have had impairment, negative reactions and irreparable harm,” Thomas wrote.","Epperly’s reply landed in her inbox minutes later: “Fuck off.”","Thomas forwarded the exchange to Davis.","About two weeks later, a representative from the agency told BuzzFeed News that the complaint had been closed — and passed on to the FDA.","“Our Consumer Protection Section reviewed the information but felt that another agency (in this case the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) may be in a better position to address the concerns presented in this complaint,” spokesperson Kate Hanson told BuzzFeed News by email.","Kennedy and Stewart received identical responses to their complaints submitted to the Ohio Medical Board. The board told them that the query had been directed to the AG’s office — the same office that had just relinquished responsibility to the FDA. (Stewart said he still hadn’t heard back from the FDA or Interpol.)","Despite the best efforts of thousands of people who banded together to boot out Epperly’s fake science news, it still thrives, dodging agency regulations and platform policies. No one seems to be able, or inclined, to make Epperly stop.","Facebook said the group doesn’t violate its policies. When asked if the Federal Trade Commission was responsible, FTC spokesperson Frank Dorman was unsure: “The FTC enforces the FTC Act against deceptive or unfair business practices, so it’s conceivable, but this might be something for the FDA,” Dorman wrote by email.","FDA spokesperson Peter Cassell told BuzzFeed News that the agency has received “at least two complaints” related to Jilly Juice (not including the two that the Ohio Attorney General passed on). He would not comment on whether the FDA is investigating these complaints.","“Marketing unapproved products that claim to prevent, diagnose, treat or cure cancer without evidence is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective,” Cassell wrote by email.","However, the FDA has not yet determined whether Epperly’s website and videos fall under its purview, since she does not sell a food or drug product.","No one seems to be able, or inclined, to make Epperly stop.","“It blows my mind that no authority will step in and say, hey lady, you need a license. You need to educate yourself properly. You need to not tell parents to give this to their children behind closed doors,” Thomas said.","Meanwhile, Epperly continues to give juice updates to the 5,000-plus followers on her personal Facebook page. Recently, she explained via live video that she had found affirmation for another of her theories: that smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer. On her new website, she put up a video claiming that Jilly Juice could possibly prevent autism and obesity in kids.","Much of her Facebook page’s discussion lately has revolved around her upcoming appearance on the Dr. Phil show, where she intends to face her detractors in front of a national television audience. “Let's bring it on baby and I'm only going to go on if I'm allowed to plug my book and my website,” she posted on March 6.","Epperly told BuzzFeed News that going on TV will be an opportunity to get it all out in the open. “It’s gonna be like Jerry Springer — I’m gonna have my haters on there. Hopefully there won’t be any chairs thrown at me.” ●"],"isopubdate":""}

But what happens if big tech was in bed with big data? What if Facebook's highly touted \"privacy\" efforts were nothing but a sham?","And why is the use personal information of 50 million Facebook acounts being called \"a breach\"?","According to the Washington Post, the former privacy manager for Facebook, Sandy Parakilas, called out Facebook, saying \"They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,” Parakilas said. “During my 16 months at the company, I don’t recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.”","So the banning is a sham. And if you dig a little further, you find that Facebook actually worked with CA.","Despite Facebook’s concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump’s digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user-experience researcher, according to Facebook’s public website.","Until 2015, Facebook allowed developers to use data harvested from apps available on the website. CA developed an app called \"Thisisyourdigitallife.\" It was just one of several interesting apps that \"predicted\" personality traits based on your \"likes\" and other social media data.","CA did absolutely nothing wrong when 270,000 Facebook users downloaded the app, giving the company access to not only some personal data of those who downloaded it, but their Facebook \"friends\" as well. Estimates put the number of Facebook accounts that were mined for data at 50 million.","But the problem is how CA used that data and whether they hung on to it despite promising to delete it.","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” said Sen. Mark R.

Is it possible that Facebook doesn’t operate in and make money in other countries as Cambridge Analytica apparently does?","On the surface, the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica (CA) face-off is fairly straightforward; bi tech vs, big data. But what happens if big tech was in bed with big data? What if Facebook's highly touted \"privacy\" efforts were nothing but a sham?","And why is the use personal information of 50 million Facebook acounts being called \"a breach\"?","According to the Washington Post, the former privacy manager for Facebook, Sandy Parakilas, called out Facebook, saying \"They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,” Parakilas said. “During my 16 months at the company, I don’t recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.”","So the banning is a sham. And if you dig a little further, you find that Facebook actually worked with CA.","Despite Facebook’s concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump’s digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user-experience researcher, according to Facebook’s public website.","Until 2015, Facebook allowed developers to use data harvested from apps available on the website. CA developed an app called \"Thisisyourdigitallife.\" It was just one of several interesting apps that \"predicted\" personality traits based on your \"likes\" and other social media data.","CA did absolutely nothing wrong when 270,000 Facebook users downloaded the app, giving the company access to not only some personal data of those who downloaded it, but their Facebook \"friends\" as well. Estimates put the number of Facebook accounts that were mined for data at 50 million.","But the problem is how CA used that data and whether they hung on to it despite promising to delete it.","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","Cambridge Analytica — which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president’s former senior adviser Stephen K.

That means congressional hearings, investigations, probably at least some regulation — and a lot more skepticism about the promise of the tech-driven changes that are transforming our lives.","What's next: Zuckerberg will almost certainly have to appear at hearings that lawmakers have promised to hold in the \"near future.\" Facebook staff will be briefing policymakers and moving ahead with its steps to tighten up its data use standards.","But that's not going to stop investigators from digging deeper, and there will be plenty of discussions about some sort of data privacy regulatory regime. While this Congress is unlikely pass privacy rules, expect Europe's very strict data law (known as GDPR) to spark more debate when it goes into effect in May.","In Arizona: An Uber self-driving car fatally struck a pedestrian in Arizona, where the company is testing its autonomous vehicles. It's the first death involved in a fully autonomous vehicle accident, and it caused many companies (including Uber) to pause their own testing of self-driving cars. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.","What's next: There's still plenty of public skepticism when it comes to trusting self-driving cars, so expect companies to double down on safety efforts.","Calls to slow down could kill an already-stalled bill in Congress that would have allowed testing of self-driving cars to proceed with minimal oversight from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.","On Capitol Hill: Congress passed a bill aiming to curb online sex trafficking of children. By changing a legal protection, websites and online platforms will be held liable for knowingly hosting trafficking-related content and ads. It hasn't been signed by the president yet, but there's already fallout: Craigslist announced it would close its personal ads section because of the new law.","What's next: While this bill ended up being a relatively narrow change to the law, it was overwhelmingly passed by a Congress that hasn't managed to pass much else. That's a sign that lawmakers are willing to take on the tech industry (albeit in somewhat limited ways) if it doesn't adequately police itself.","It could alsoopen the door to more regulation of online platforms. But even with Facebook's data scandal, don't expect sweeping regulations targeting tech anytime soon.","In Brussels: The European Commission proposed a new tax that would hit major U.S. web companies like Google, Amazon, Uber and Facebook that do significant business in Europe. The EU says the new 3% tax on revenue (which translates to hundreds of millions of euros) will ensure that digital companies \"contribute their fair share of tax\" even though they have little or no physical presence in EU states. U.S. tech companies say it will hurt trade and investment.","What's next: This is a temporary measure that would expire once EU states implement a proposal for longer-term rules. But tax changes require unanimous support by all EU countries, and some smaller countries have expressed concern, per the WSJ. Expect the tech industry to keep lobbying against it.","In court: The trial over the Justice Department's lawsuit to block AT&T's $85 billion purchase of Time Warner began on a heated note. The outcome of this trial will help shape how we watch TV shows and movies, and how telecom giants can compete with streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon. In the first day of arguments, AT&T's lawyer had some aggressive moments against a more reserved DOJ.","What's next: This is a long trial that will probably last two months, and it will only get more contentious. Next week Turner CEO John Martin (who has called the government \"clueless,\" per Deadline) will take the witness stand."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-24"}

While you may not have heard of SCL, its political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica has made headlines in the last few years due to work for the Trump campaign and the Brexit initiative. According to former US Magistrate and current Facebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal, this move is occurring because an app \"thisisyourdigitallife\" pulled in personal information of the 270,000 people who used it as well as information from their friends. While this is allowed under its policy, its creator -- a Cambridge psych professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan -- passed the data onto other parties including Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook's stance is that it requested the deletion of the data in 2015, which Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, said they did. The social network disagrees, and said it has been informed that not all of the data was deleted. Now it's suspending their access while it investigates.","So who are these people and what did they do with that data? Last May The Guardian reported extensively on Cambridge Analytica, citing a source who said Wylie is \"the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica.\" That same article specifically pointed out Kogan's app and its link to the company, which combined psychological profiles with specific names, phone numbers and email address plus information it bought from consumer databases. One of the claims it makes is that as much as promoting one candidate, its objective was voter disengagement and to keep potential Democratic voters home.","Facebook's VP of consumer hardware and former VP of ads, Andrew Bosworth, tweeted \"We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies. They cannot buy ads or administer its clients' pages.\" Facebook also noted that in 2014, it changed its policies around how apps can pull information from someone's friends, and now puts apps through a review process to find out if they need all the information they're requesting. But as a report by The Intercept detailing how Kogan's program worked by signing up Amazon Mechanical Turkers notes, the information had already been obtained.","As Facebook continues to investigate, there will surely be more scrutiny from all sides over how internet companies are protecting their user's information. Oh, and there's one more thing you should know -- this announcement comes the same day that a lawsuit filed by a US professor against Cambridge Analytica has been filed. Mother Jones reports that David Carroll requested a copy of the data the company has compiled on him and says that what he received is incomplete.","Update: Cambridge Analytica has responded to the suspension. It claimed it \"fully complies\" with Facebook's terms of service and that its commercial and political wings don't use or hold on to data from Facebook. CA said it had contracted Global Science Research to collect data within the UK Data Protection Act and with consent, but deleted that data when it realized that GSR had collected info against Facebook policies. None of that info was used in the Trump campaign, it said.","We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies. They cannot buy ads or administer its clients' pages. https://t.co/YIJ8MF4XI6"],"isopubdate":"2151-11-02"}
{"originalurl":"https://thebestvpn.com/online-privacy-guide/","title":"Online Privacy Guide: 19 Actionable Steps to Remain Anonymous","text":["19 Steps to Protect Your Online Privacy in 2018","This article was put together with the help of Dana Jackson (PrivacyHub).","Online privacy is a topic that grows in importance every single year.","With more and more web services, connected apps, and even home assistant devices that are gaining in popularity, it’s now more crucial than ever to understand what the dangers to your online privacy are and how to protect it consciously.","Here are 19 actionable steps to help you remain anonymous on the web and protect your online privacy. No sophisticated computer knowledge required.","1. Consider getting a VPN","Normally, your connection to the web is unprotected by anything. It’s just your computer requesting a website (or a service, or a tweet, etc.) and then the server providing that website to you.","What’s problematic from an online privacy point of view here is that such a connection is public, can be intercepted, and every server helping on with the connection along the way can take a peek into what’s being transmitted. If it’s a sensitive email (or anything to that nature) then you really don’t want that.","This is where a VPN comes into play. VPN (or Virtual Private Network) is a service that allows you to connect to the web safely by routing your connection through a VPN server before it gets to its destination.","Here’s a quick visualization of what your connection looks like without and then with a VPN enabled:","What a VPN actually does is encrypting the connection so that even if someone intercepts it, the information within will be scrambled and unreadable. In fact, no intercepting party will be able to determine where the connection is coming from or what it is about, thus giving you improved online privacy.","Even though the concept might seem complicated and intimidating at first, modern VPNs are actually very easy to use and don’t require any technical skills like server configuration or routing. All you need to do is literally install your VPN of choice and enable it with a single click.","VPN services are great. That’s more than true. However, not universally across the board.","As someone once said, “if you’re not paying for the product, then you’re the product”. And this is even more concerning considering that we’re dealing with the topic of online privacy. At the end of the day, no one wants to have their data compromised or sold to a third party purely because they failed to read the fine-print when signing up for a seemingly great free VPN service.","2. Use the privacy/incognito mode","All current versions of web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Opera come with a privacy mode.","For example, in Chrome, if you press CMD+SHIFT+N (Mac) or CTRL+SHIFT+N (Win), you will open a new tab in privacy mode. In that mode, the browser doesn’t store any data at all from the current session. This means no web history, no web cache, no cookies, nothing at all.","Use this mode whenever doing anything that you’d prefer remain private and not able to be retrieved at a later date on the device that you’re using.","However! Let’s make it clear that privacy modes don’t make the connection more secure in any way. They just make it private in relation to your own device – meaning, they make it private on your end only.","(Privacy modes are also available in mobile browsers.)","3. Block web activity trackers","The main online privacy concern with the modern web is that you’re basically being tracked everywhere you go.","And this is not only about ads. Basically, every website that you visit will attempt to track your activity in multiple different manners. Just to name a few:","Traffic analytics – used commonly by most websites to get a better understanding of their audience, where they’re from, what devices they’re using, how much time they’re spending on the website, what sub-pages they’re interacting with, and so on.","Current location – commonly used by functional widgets like weather widgets, “near events”, and so on. But also used for general tracking and data analysis.","Social media – used to show you people’s activity in relation to the page or article that you’re reading. A specific example of this is the Facebook pixel:","Facebook pixel – those are meant to connect your activity with your Facebook profile, thus giving Facebook a better understanding of what your behavior is and what to show in your news feed (including which ads you’re most likely to enjoy).","Media trackers – for example, if there’s a YouTube video on the page, that video block is connected to your other YouTube activity, thus having an impact on what kind of videos YouTube is likely to recommend you next.","All of those trackers can make websites slower and generally less safe to use.","One of the viable solutions is to use a tool like Ghostery. It’s free and has versions for all major web browsers. The installation is simple, and it basically starts working right out the box.","4. Use ad blockers","Various sources (e.g. 1, 2) indicate that Google serves around 29 billion ads every single day.","But that’s only Google. What about Facebook? What about all the in-house ad inventory handled by webmasters themselves, without any ad network in between? It’s not unreasonable to estimate that the total number might grow to even 60 billion.","In simple terms, ads are everywhere. But their sole existence isn’t problematic from an online privacy point of view.","What is problematic is that ads are not “closed black boxes”. It’s quite the opposite – they take in a lot of data, “listening” to what you’re doing and taking note of every click and every action you take. That data can then be used to follow you on the web and serve you even more targeted ads the next time around.","All of the above is common market practice. It’s not illegal to do any of it. In fact, all those tracking algorithms are considered clever for how effective they are.","But then there’s also the other side of the coin. Some ads go even further and try to infect your computer with malware, trick you into installing unsafe software, or try getting accidental clicks by hiding the fact that they are ads in the first place (impersonating the design of the site they’re on).","The best solution to not get affected by any of this is to simply block ads altogether. The easiest way to do that is by installing an ad blocker extension in your browser. Such an extension will block out any ad and prevent it from displaying. Ad blockers usually work right out the box with no configuration needed.","5. Use Signal or Telegram for messaging","Not all online communication is equally secured or protects your online privacy enough.","For example, email in itself isn’t the most private form of communication due to all the connection layers and different servers that participate in order to get the email to its destination.","Using solutions like Facebook Messenger or direct messages on Twitter raises whole other privacy concerns related to those corporations’ agendas and ways of handling user data. It wasn’t that long ago when we heard about 32 million Twitter passwords potentially getting hacked and leaked, for instance.","A much better solution is to use other tools for casual communication and even sensitive conversations. Tools like Signal and Telegram, even though seeming like something that your younger cousin might use, are, in fact, top-of-the-line when it comes to making sure that whatever’s been said via the tool’s communication lines remains private.","Both Signal and Telegram employ end-to-end encryption. They even come with multiple mobile and desktop apps.","More than that, both apps also now enable voice calls, which presents a much safer and more private alternative to classic phone calls.","6. Don’t input sensitive personal data on non-HTTPs websites","In simple terms, HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP – the standard protocol that’s used to send data between your web browser and the website you’re reading.","Checking whether you’re connected to a website via HTTPS is very simple. All you need to do is take a look at your browser’s address bar and notice if the address starts with https:// plus if there’s a green padlock icon next to it. Like so:","The important thing to remember here is to never enter any sensitive information on websites that don’t have HTTPS enabled. This includes things like your credit card information, social security numbers, address information, or anything else that you don’t want to have compromised.","Unfortunately, there isn’t “a fix” that you can do if a given website doesn’t have HTTPS. You simply have to avoid websites like that.","7. Clear your cookies regularly","Cookies are a popular term on the web, but very few people realize what they actually are. Technically speaking, cookies are quite simple. They’re just small text files that are kept on your computer (and your mobile devices as well). They store small packets of information related to your personal activity in connection with a given website.","The most classic use of a cookie is to keep you logged in to a certain website and not force you to re-enter your credentials every time you come back. But cookies can go much further than that.","These days, they’re also commonly used to store your shopping cart items (in case you decide to abandon your cart but then come back to the site later on and continue shopping), or to keep track of the content that you read previously on the site (thus helping with future content suggestions). These are just two of tens of possibilities.","Cookies are perhaps impossible to avoid entirely. If you disable them altogether, you’re effectively making it nearly impossible for yourself to use sites like Facebook, Twitter, most e-commerce stores, or other services where login is required.","What you can do, though, is at least clear your cookies occasionally. This can help keep your browser clean and also not let some websites take advantage of older cookies that they set up maybe even months ago, thus making it more difficult to track your online habits.","8. Only use secure email","As we said above when discussing online messengers (in #6), email is not the most secure form of communication online. On the other hand, it’s hard to imagine our life without email entirely, so, in some situations, we just need to bite the bullet and use email anyway.","However, there are still things that we can do to make it more secure.","First off, you can say goodbye to free email solutions like Gmail or Outlook.com, and instead opt for a premium one. One of the viable alternatives in that realm is the secure email service Tutanota that comes with a fully encrypted mailbox.","Other than that, you can attempt to add another layer of encryption on top of your existing free email inbox. For instance, if you use Gmail, you can get this Chrome extensions, which will enable end-to-end encryption on your messages as well as attachments. This sort of encryption makes sure that your conversation remains private.","9. Review the permissions given to your mobile apps","Each app that you have on your iPhone, iPad, or Android device requires a certain set of permissions to deliver its functionality. Sometimes, though, certain apps become too demanding in this department, requesting access to more than seems necessary to make the app operational.","If you ever caught yourself wondering, “Why does a recipe app need access to my location all the time?” then you know what we’re talking about.","What you should do from time to time is go through your currently installed apps and review the permissions given to them. Most of the time, you can revoke part of those permissions without making the app useless (like the recipe app example).","On iPhone, you can do that by going to Settings, scrolling to the bottom, and then going through each app one by one.","10. Update to a newer mobile device","It seems that every year companies like Apple, Samsung, Google try to convince us to buy the latest smartphone and toss our old ones away. Naturally, we resist. But we can’t resist forever. At least not if we don’t want our online privacy to take a hit.","What we need to remember is that modern mobile devices are computers. Just like your desktop PC or Mac, but only slightly less powerful. Therefore, they’re also prone to various security threats, and just like any other device, they require constant updates to stay secure.","New devices are being updated constantly, so that’s no problem. Older ones, not so much.","For example, Nexus 7 – a device that’s still relatively popular (you can buy them on eBay right now) – stopped getting security patches after June 2015. This means that whoever’s using it has been left on their own and exposed to new security threats for more than two years now.","Whether we like it or not, at some point, a new device is unavoidable.","11. Shred your files","Although sounds surprising, getting rid of a specific file once and for all isn’t that easy. Simply moving it to the bin and then emptying it won’t do. Any file removed through this standard operation is easily recoverable in full.","This is due to how the process of deleting anything actually works. In its most basic state, your operating system will just make a note that the space where your file used to be “is now free” with no actual deleting taking place. Therefore, if someone knows where to look, they can still access that file easily.","A safer solution is to take advantage of a “file shredding” tool. Those will allow you to remove sensitive, private files from your hard drive by overwriting them several times with random sets of data and in random patterns.","12. Be careful with social media","The ideal case from an online privacy point of view would be to delete your Facebook account entirely, but that’s probably out of the question for most people. So, instead, at least be careful about what sort of data you share with your favorite social platform.","For once, don’t share your location with Facebook all the time and with every update you post. There have been multiple cases of people’s homes robbed after they posted updates about them being on vacation. For instance, three robbers in New Hampshire got away with $200,000 worth of stolen goods after breaking into 50 homes, all made possible by checking Facebook statuses of their victims beforehand.","A good rule of thumb is to not post any information that you’d consider sensitive from an online privacy point of view. Assume that the whole world is going to see your next status update.","13. Access the web via TOR","Tor has been getting a lot of bad reputation over the years, not always for all the right reasons. Tor, as a technology, is a very clever mechanism that allows you to remain completely anonymous while browsing the web.","Tor (short for “The Onion Router”) routes your web connection through a number of nodes before it gets to its destination. Because of that, no one is able to track it or view what’s being transmitted. In some aspects, Tor is similar to VPN. The main difference between the two is that VPN connects you through one additional server, while Tor uses multiple ones.","Getting started with Tor is simple – all you need is the official Tor web browser. There are versions available for all major systems. After getting it installed and fired up, you can establish a connection with the Tor network via a single click. At that stage, your connection is secure and anonymous. Here’s what the browser looks like:","14. Don’t use Windows 10 if you can","Windows 10 is notorious for its “loose” approach towards online privacy. On its default setup, the system is set to share all of your personal information (including your activity) with Microsoft and even third parties. It also synchronizes all your browsing history and other settings back to Microsoft servers.","On top of that, Cortana – the system’s assistant – records all your keystrokes and listens to all your activity.","If that’s not enough, Microsoft is also making it surprisingly difficult to set things the way they should be. Basically, every consecutive update of the system tends to bring back the factory settings, thus forcing you do carry through with your fixes once again.","At the end of the day, if it’s a viable option for you, say goodbye to Windows 10 entirely.","15. Consider not using Google","This goes not only for the main Google search engine but also all of the other tools – Google Analytics, Gmail, Google Apps, Google Drive, etc.","Due to its huge network and portfolio of tools, Google knows basically everything about you there is to know. Whether you’re comfortable with this from an online privacy point of view is up to you.","When it comes to the main search engine, DuckDuckGo is an alternative worth considering, or even Bing (but then we’re back in camp Microsoft).","As for things like Gmail and Google Drive, there are multiple viable solutions on the web. For example, SpiderOak is an interesting alternative to Google Drive and Dropbox that even has Edward Snowden’s approval.","16. Probably delete Facebook from your phone","There have been multiple stories appearing lately describing Facebook’s alleged “in the background listening” practices. Some people are reporting concerns related to the Facebook app listening on to the conversations they’re having over the phone and then suggesting ads based on the things mentioned in those conversations.","In all likelihood, or at least we’d like to believe so, this is not entirely plausible – and Facebook obviously denies. However, getting rid of the Facebook app from your phone surely won’t hurt your overall online privacy.","17. Do you really need that Amazon Echo?","As useful as those new home assistants can be, they also carry some serious online privacy concerns with them. Most of all, they’re in an “always on, always listening” state.","What this means is that Alexa is constantly listening to everything – everything(!) – you say around the house, and transmitting it over the internet to Amazon’s servers.","Ultimately, you have no control over how that data is going to be used and by whom. Though, full disclosure, Amazon says they don’t share your Amazon Echo data with third parties.","Google Home, however, is perhaps even more hostile to your privacy. Apart from microphone access (always listening) it also tracks your location and can share your data for advertising purposes with third parties (including Google’s other companies).","18. Use virtual machines","Virtual machines let you simulate a second computer (a virtual one) within an application. It’s basically a sandbox. The virtual machine can be limited in any way you need it to be, for instance, with the web connection disabled, or any other part of the system removed.","Virtual machines are great if you want to do a sensitive task on your computer that doesn’t necessarily involve a web connection. Or, even more so, when you want to make sure that the web connection is unavailable and that your actions are not logged for any future transmission to a third party.","In other words, if you want to open a file and you need to be sure that no one is watching over your shoulder as you do so, you can do that via a virtual machine. Then, after you’re done, you can delete that virtual machine and thus remove every trace of the operation.","Try out VirtualBox, a popular free solution that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac.","19. Avoid public Wi-Fi","As much as everyone loves those free Starbucks Wi-Fi hotspots, you should perhaps be careful around them. Or, rather, not perhaps, but definitely.","Public Wi-Fi raises a number of online privacy concerns:","You never know who’s running the hotspot, what the software is, what the setup is, what sort of information is being logged, and so on.","You don’t have any certainty if the hotspot you’re using isn’t an “evil twin” – a hotspot created to impersonate the genuine Wi-Fi network that you actually intended to use. For example, let’s say that you see an open network called, “Starbucks Free Internet”, so you decide to connect. However, you have no way of telling if that network is actually the official one run by the coffee shop. Essentially, anyone with a mobile router can create a network like that and then steal the information of anyone who connects to it. Listen to the first episode of Hackable – a podcast by McAfee to learn more about this (available on iTunes).","You can’t be sure that using a VPN will protect you. In most cases, VPNs solve the problem, but if you’re dealing with a fake network then the person running it might still be able to see what’s going on. Additionally, there’s the issue of DNS leaks. In simple terms, your laptop can still be using its default DNS settings to connect to the web, rather than the VPN’s safe servers. Here’s more on the topic.","What can you do?","Really avoid public Wi-Fi networks if you want to perform any sort of sensitive operation. Don’t access your online banking platforms or anything else where your privacy is of utmost importance.","If you do use public Wi-Fi, also use a VPN. Do the DNS leak test available here to make sure that the connection is secure.","Always ask what’s the exact name of the public network that you want to connect with – to avoid connecting to an evil twin.","Conclusion: Protecting Your Online Privacy is Simple","Online privacy is a topic that has been gaining in importance more and more over the last couple of years.","Apart from those basic, common-sense things that every web user should be doing in terms of their online privacy, there are also matters of new regulations and problematic net neutrality issues that have appeared quite recently.","These days, it seems that you can’t easily escape big corporations tracking you online, your ISP (internet service provider) recording your online activity and perhaps even selling the data to third parties (which is legal in the US).","All in all, this can be frightening. However, there still are viable things you can do and tools you can use to keep and protect your online privacy. We hope that the list above gave you a good overview of what’s possible and how easy to carry out most of those actions are. But you do need to be deliberate, and also review your online privacy optimizations every once in a while."],"isopubdate":"2018-06-22"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2FZdgCf?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.64de8de7a3b1","title":"U.S. and British lawmakers demand answers from Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg - The Washington Post","text":["Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are calling on Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how the names, preferences and other information from tens of millions of users ended up in the hands of a data analysis firm connected with President Trump's 2016 campaign.","The demands came in response to news reports Saturday about how the firm, Cambridge Analytica, used a feature once available to Facebook app developers to collect information on 270,000 people and, in the process, gain access to data on tens of millions of their Facebook “friends” — few, if any, of whom had given explicit permission for this sharing.","Though both companies have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either nation.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Trump has referred to him as “little Rocket Man” in tweets.","Kim’s diplomatic debut will make it harder to dismiss him outright, experts said.","“We’re seeing a carefully crafted North Korean strategy on diplomacy unfold on the world stage, starting with Beijing,” Jean H. Lee, a North Korea expert and fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington, said in an email.","“Shutting China out and ramping up the rhetoric with the United States gave [Kim] the space and justification he needed to expedite the building of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles,” she wrote. “Now, with a program he feels confident is a proven threat, he feels emboldened to force the region’s leaders to treat him as an equal, not as the young son of a dictator who inherited power.”","China’s Xi may take issue with “equal.” There have been few signs that Xi is fond of Kim.","Only two years into his reign, Kim had his uncle, who was North Korea’s main liaison with China, executed for building his own power base.","Then, in 2016, as Xi was hosting a Group of 20 summit on his home turf, Kim presided over the launch of three medium-range ballistic missiles, stealing the spotlight. The South Korean military called the move an act of “armed protest” against Xi.","When Xi sent a top official to Pyongyang last year, Kim did not even see him.","Successive American administrations have called on China to use its economic leverage over North Korea to exert control. But analysts say that China’s main priority has always been stability and that it does not want to do anything that could cause the collapse of the Kim regime, which could bring millions of hungry refu­gees — and, it fears, U.S. troops — to its door.","Amid increasing talk of military options from the Trump administration, China seemed more willing to act. It has been more carefully enforcing sanctions, conducting intrusive inspections of cargo and cutting off key North Korean exports, including seafood and workers.","Those efforts helped bring Kim back to the table. “Amid the tightened sanctions, rapprochement with China has become a practical need of great urgency for North Korea,” said Cheong Seong-chang, an expert on North Korea’s leadership at the Sejong Institute near Seoul.","In the short term, experts see the meeting as a sign that the Trump summit is likely to go ahead. Kim can now enter those talks with more confidence.","“The visit is a breakthrough of the diplomatic isolation imposed on North Korea,” said Cai Jian, executive director of the Center for Korean Studies at Shanghai’s Fudan University.","He said that Kim, having shaken hands with Xi, heads into the negotiating room with “more useful bargaining chips, or a more advantageous position to negotiate with the West.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebook’s official post.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” the added language argued.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","While the language is up for debate, lawmakers don’t appear to be looking kindly on Facebook’s arguably legitimate effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)","While most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I’ve called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.","On Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”","Just what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Revelations that some 50 million of its user profiles were inappropriately harvested add to a list of outcries over the social network’s practices. It has come to the point where Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, will have to prove somehow he is not in way over his head.","Mr. Zuckerberg, a 33-year-old Harvard dropout, has encountered doubters every step of the way since starting Facebook in his dorm room and building it into a juggernaut valued at more than $500 billion. The hubris accumulated from the achievements is now plain to see. Mr. Zuckerberg seems either oblivious to — or incapable of assuming — the responsibilities of running an enterprise of extraordinary political, cultural and social influence.","It is evident even in the company’s lame response to the latest imbroglio. The New York Times and The Observer of London chronicled, with the help of a whistle-blower, how a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, exploited Facebook user information. Worse, they say, Facebook knew about it and failed to alert customers. The tin-eared first lines of defense over such harrowing claims were to argue that what occurred was not technically a “data breach” and to belatedly suspend the firm’s account.","Responses from outside Facebook were notably, and deservedly, more severe. Lawmakers in the United States called for investigations into the leaks. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, demanded that Mr. Zuckerberg appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which she sits. A Conservative British lawmaker called for him to testify in a parliamentary inquiry over Russian meddling in Britain’s referendum to leave the European Union.

In a nutshell, they’re viewing the breach as the digital equivalent of a toxic waste spill -- one that has prompted calls for greater government oversight of social-media companies.","The BetaShares Global Sustainability Leaders ETF removed Facebook from its fund last week, citing a reassessment after the Cambridge Analytica data breach and other controversies. Facebook accounts for about 3.9 percent of the fund, the largest ethical ETF traded in Australia. Nordea Bank also blacklisted the stock last week, saying it won’t let its sustainable-investment unit buy more amid concerns about “systemic issues.” Other Nordic investors focused on ESG issues also are reviewing their holdings.","“Data security and privacy are significant ESG risks,” Janicke Scheele, head of responsible investments at DNB Asset Management AS, said in an email, adding that she’s following the situation closely.","The turmoil has blown about $90 billion of market value out of Facebook stock in the past 10 days, after reports that Cambridge Analytica, the data-analysis company that helped with President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, kept data from 50 million users even after telling Facebook it had destroyed the information. The shares dropped 2.4 percent to $155.55 at 12:49 p.m. in New York, extending this year’s decline to 12 percent, the fifth-worst performance among 70 companies in the S&P 500 Information Technology Index.","Social-Impact Concerns","Ethical funds often make heavy bets on technology companies, which typically have a low carbon footprint and better-than-average transparency on environmental issues. The funds sometimes let this outweigh concerns about social impact or governance skewed toward founders.","Facebook has wooed do-good investors with pledges to aggressively reduce carbon emissions with renewable-energy investments. About 11 percent of funds that specifically focus on environmentally or socially responsible investing hold about 6.3 million Facebook shares, according to data for almost 1,200 funds compiled by Bloomberg. Eighty ESG funds count Facebook as a top-10 holding, which helped drive their performance last year as the tech company’s stock rose.","MSCI Inc. and Robecosam AG, which issue sustainability ratings, are considering downgrading Facebook, spokesmen said. The company was never included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes, which Robecosam oversees, or the MSCI ESG Leaders indexes amid the concerns about regulatory risks from privacy and data security, and a lack of checks and balances in Facebook’s corporate governance, which leaves control with founder Mark Zuckerberg, they said.","Facebook spokeswoman Nora Chan said the company had no comment.","Sin Stocks","Some socially responsible investors have begun lumping Facebook in with so-called sin stocks, such as tobacco or weapons shares, they routinely filter out of their portfolios.","“We’ve had a few requests around screening out Facebook in the past few days,” said Jennifer Sireklove, director of responsible investing at Eaton Vance Corp.’s Parametric Portfolio Associates LLC, which works with foundations and endowments. But she’s telling investors “if your intent is to get the company to improve, you actually need to own the company and have a plan for engagement,” she said.","A shareholder proposal about Facebook’s content policies could become a flash point for concerned investors at this year’s annual meeting. The company’s board opposed the proposal, led by shareholders Arjuna Capital and the New York State Common Retirement Fund, but the investors behind it now anticipate increased support, according to Arjuna.","“At the end of the day, we want Facebook to step up their transparency and governance surrounding not only user privacy, but illegal and hateful content propagated over their platform,” said Natasha Lamb, managing partner at Arjuna. “We just requested a renewed dialog with the company this week.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The company claims that it wasn’t breached and that while it has suspended Cambridge Analytica from its service, the social giant is not at fault. Facebook contends that its technology worked exactly how Facebook built it to work, but those bad actors, like Cambridge Analytica, violated the company’s terms of service.","On the other hand, Facebook has since changed those terms of service to cut down on information third parties can collect, essentially admitting that its prior terms weren’t very good.","So how did Cambridge Analytica get Facebook data on some 50 million people?","Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, tweeted a lengthy defence of the company, which also included a helpful explanation for how this came about. (He later deleted the tweets, saying he “should have done a better job weighing in,” though you can see screenshots of some of them below.)","Facebook offers a number of technology tools for software developers, and one of the most popular is Facebook Login, which lets people simply log in to a website or app using their Facebook account instead of creating new credentials. People use it because it’s easy — usually one or two taps — and eliminates the need for people to remember a bunch of unique usernames and password combinations.","An example of what Facebook Login looks like. Facebook","When people use Facebook Login, though, they grant the app’s developer a range of information from their Facebook profile — things like their name, location, email or friends list. This is what happened in 2015 when a Cambridge University professor named Dr Aleksandr Kogan created an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that utilized Facebook’s login feature. Some 270,000 people used Facebook Login to create accounts and thus opted in to share personal profile data with Kogan.","Back in 2015, though, Facebook also allowed developers to collect some information on the friend networks of people who used Facebook Login. That means that while a single user may have agreed to hand over their data, developers could also access some data about their friends. This was not a secret — Facebook says it was documented in their terms of service — but it has since been updated so that this is no longer possible, at least not at the same level of detail.","Through those 270,000 people who opted in, Kogan was able to get access to data from some 50 million Facebook users, according to the Times. That data trove could have included information about people’s locations and interests, and more granular stuff like photos, status updates and check-ins.","The Times found that Cambridge Analytica’s data for “roughly 30 million [people] contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles.”","This all happened just as Facebook intended for it to happen. All of this data collection followed the company’s rules and guidelines.","Things became problematic when Kogan shared this data with Cambridge Analytica. Facebook contends this is against the company’s terms of service. According to those rules, developers are not allowed to “transfer any data that you receive from us (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived data) to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.”","As Stamos tweeted out Saturday (before later deleting the tweet): “Kogan did not break into any systems, bypass any technical controls, or use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed. He did, however, misuse that data after he gathered it, but that does not retroactively make it a ‘breach.’”","The problem here is that Facebook gives a lot of trust to the developers who use its software features. The company’s terms of service are an agreement in the same way any user agrees to use Facebook: The rules represent a contract that Facebook can use to punish someone, but not until after that someone has already broken the rules.","Facebook is not alone in this world of data sharing. The major mobile platforms like iOS and Android allow developers to collect people’s contact lists with permission. Twitter has a login feature similar to Facebook Login, and so do Google and LinkedIn."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The correct answer, of course, is about 6 percent. And this is not just a harmless bit of ignorance, like not being able to name the vice president. “It matters,” we’re told, “because the degree to which people perceive problems guides how they make political decisions.”","My first thought when I saw this is the same one I have a lot: how has this changed over time? After all, if Americans always think the unemployment rate is way higher than it is, then it doesn’t mean much. But I couldn’t find any previous polling data on this. I made a few desultory attempts in between football games this weekend, but came up empty.","Luckily, John Sides is a stronger man than me, and also more familiar with the past literature on this stuff. It turns out there’s not very much to look at, actually, but what there is suggests that this Ipsos-MORI poll is a weird outlier. Generally, speaking, most people do know roughly what the unemployment rate is:","In this 1986 article….two-thirds, stated that the unemployment rate was 10 percent, 11 percent, or 12 percent — a substantial degree of accuracy.","In this 2014 article….approximately 40-50 percent of respondents could estimate this rate within 1 percentage point.","In this 2014 article….most respondents gave fairly accurate estimates — which is reflected in the median.","So the whole thing is a little odd. In past polls, people weren’t too far off. In this one, they’re off by more than 25 points. Something doesn’t add up, but it’s not clear what. In any case, it’s worth taking this whole thing with a grain of salt.","But all is not lost. If you decide to take this poll seriously anyway, you might be interested to know that the unemployment results are merely one part of a broader report titled “Perils of Perception.” Basically, it’s an international survey showing just how wrong people in different countries are about things like murder rates, number of Muslims, teen birth rates, voting, and so forth. This is then compiled into a handy “Index of Ignorance.”","So who’s #1? Not us. We came in second to Italy. But that’s not too bad! We’re pretty damn ignorant, and with a little less effort we might take the top spot next year. Still, even though Germans and Swedes may feel smug about their knowledge of demographic facts, can they launch pointless wars in the Middle East whenever they feel like it? No they can’t. So there.","POSTSCRIPT: On a slightly more serious note, Sides tells us that not only is the Ipsos-MORI poll an odd outlier, but that his research suggests that ignorance of the unemployment rate has very little impact on people’s attitudes anyway. I’d say the Ipsos-MORI poll accidentally confirms this. The German public, for example, has a much more accurate view of the unemployment rate than the American public. So has that helped their policymaking? It has not. Over the past few years, Germany has probably had the worst economic policy of any developed country, while the US has had among the best. A well-informed public may be less important than we think.","FACT:","Mother Jones was founded as a nonprofit in 1976 because we knew corporations and the wealthy wouldn’t fund the type of hard-hitting journalism we set out to do.","Today, reader support makes up about two-thirds of our budget, allows us to dig deep on stories that matter, and lets us keep our reporting free for everyone.

The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a \"secret sauce\" it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.","Rival consultants and campaign aides, though, expressed doubts about the company's claims. Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital operations in 2016, said the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's data, relying instead on voter data from a Republican National Committee operation.","What is it accused of?","Cambridge Analytica beginning in 2014 obtained data on 50 million Facebook users via means that deceived both the users and Facebook, the New York Times and London's Observer reported on Saturday.","The data was harvested by an application developed by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, the newspapers said. Some 270,000 people downloaded the application and logged in with their Facebook credentials, according to Facebook. The application gathered their data and data about their friends, and then Kogan passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, according to both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.","Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it did not initially know Kogan violated Facebook's terms, and that it deleted the data once it found out in 2015. Kogan could not be reached for comment.","The data, though, was not deleted, the two newspapers reported on Saturday. Cambridge Analytica said that the allegation was not true. Facebook said it was investigating to verify the accuracy of the claim.","What happens next?","Facebook said it was pressing Cambridge Analytica for answers, after getting assurances from the firm in 2015 that it had deleted all data. Facebook has hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to help.","While Facebook investigates, the social network said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, its parent SCL, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, from its platform for violating Facebook rules.","Facebook's probe, though, may have to wait until government authorities complete their investigation. The UK Information Commissioner's Office is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's office and asked Facebook's auditors to stand down in the meantime, according to Facebook.","Attorneys general from the US states of Massachusetts and Connecticut have launched investigations into how the Facebook data was handled, and the attorney general's office in California, where Facebook is based, said it had concerns."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","The New York Times is reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong.

He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups.

Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending information over misuse of data.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Nix told the same MPs: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office.","It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in the largest ever breach of Facebook data.","Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence he supplied to authorities in the UK and US includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he told the Observer. “That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile information, but it was for research purposes only.","So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing of Facebook data.","Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies.

For example, from my own experience, I have come across when discussing some sort of information with my colleagues or my friends, for example, and, all of a sudden, in my Facebook or in my Google I can see ads targeted to what I was actually discussing. So there’s actually no fine line on how much these tech giants are actually collecting data from, so it’s quite scary, to be honest. All in all, it all boils down to the permissions given to the applications. It is not only the main Facebook application.","You have the Messenger application; you have the Messenger Lite application. I’m not sure that you realized upon installing and using these applications the first time on your phone you are actually asked a few questions. In the first, installing and using this application they will actually ask if you would like to link and upload your phone’s contacts to Facebook because you will make things easier for users to find or add friends on Facebook with all this contact data.","This step, though, is optional but not only on the Facebook application. Messenger will actually ask users for permission to access the SMS and call data on your phones for a similar purpose. But for Messenger, in particular, not the plain Facebook app, you’ll also be able to access your SMS messages and also your call log logs directly from your Messenger application. Think of it as an all-in-one messenger. When you have given all these permissions to Facebook to access all this data that was actually how they have managed to update all this data they have stored. Outside of the application and not just inside what you have given to Facebook and all these things are actually stored on your phone.","Sputnik: Do you think that in the future we can expect that there will be some kind of way to opt out of certain permissions?","Kenneth Shak: They should give a bit more convenience to the users to choose what they want to share. Actually, on your phones you can explicitly disable what you can share, for example the phone, the contacts, the storage, the camera. You can actually disable all those but they need all these permissions in order to work properly.","I’m not sure if you know, back February this year, Germany actually came to a ruling that how Facebook actually collects and uses the personal data of these users to be illegal. The reason is because there is insufficient information provided by Facebook to the users in order for the users to run their meaningful consent. So the users actually don’t know what exactly they are giving consent to. Facebook actually asked the users to agree to give access to camera, to the contacts, to the SMSs, to the address books but they do not tell the users to what extent they are giving or how much data they’re actually giving. This is actually a very-very vague consent given to Facebook.","Sputnik: So, now after that ruling, were there any changes made or was Facebook subjected any fines? What happened with Facebook in that situation?","Kenneth Shak: It depends very much from country to country. Since Facebook actually asked the users for their consents, no matter how vague they are, to gather and store this data during the installation, it may actually be legal for Facebook to do so. It’s a very-very fine line. It also boils down to the regulations imposed by different countries or their governments and where the Facebook actually operates. Germany can’t do much.","They can just rule that, this information, how they gather it, is very illegal. But since Facebook operates in Ireland and the US, users outside of these countries mainly are not able to do anything except filing a lawsuit from where Facebook is operating from, for example US or Ireland. For example, from our side, users from Malaysia definitely wouldn’t be able to do anything in regards to this issue because Facebook is not sanctioned under our Malaysian laws.","Sputnik: Do you think that we could see some serious legal action that’s going to have some really huge impact, not only on Facebook but on other tech companies as well?","Kenneth Shak: Definitely this is just the tip of the iceberg, but again as you know this is not the first kind of problem relating to personal data that actually surfaced. So for Facebook we actually see quite a number of lawsuits coming in and several governments are actually inquiring into this particular issue. Of course, all this amounts to Facebook losing nearly $50 billion off their share price. There is a long road ahead for Facebook trying to recover from all this. In light of all these issues Facebook, and not just Facebook, in particular and social media platforms like Instagram may be imposed with further regulations as well. This problem brings to light many other enhancements and additions of the regulations for other companies or tech giants as well in the future, not just for Facebook. The world will actually start to learn from this particular big issue and we will see further developments to this question as investigations on this issue are still on going.","The views and opinions expressed by Kenneth Shak are those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect Sputnik's position.","Hello,\n!","We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.","Please review our Privacy Policy.

The report, based on former employees, associates and documents, alleges Cambridge Analytica used the data to target voters during the 2016 presidential election.","Global Science's Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, gained access to the personal information of 270,000 Facebook users in 2013 after they chose to download his app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” which billed itself as a research app used by psychologists. The information included hometown, content the users liked and their friends.","The app also collected information from people's friends. According to the New York Times, 30 million of those profiles had enough information to match users to other records and build profiles of them.

An editor with the Guardian-owned Observer tweeted that Facebook threatened to sue the company ahead of publication.","Facebook pointed to a tweet by senior executive Andrew Bosworth, previously vice president of ads, who took issue with the Times' description of Cambridge Analytica's alleged exploit as a breach or data leak. \"People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation.\"","In a statement Saturday, Cambridge Analytica said that it fully complied with Facebook's terms of service and is working with the social media giant to resolve the matter.","\"No data from (Global Science Research) was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" the company said in a statement.","\"Cambridge Analytica only receives​ and use​s​ data that has been obtained legally and fairly,\" it said.","When asked to comment on the newspapers' reports, it responded with a letter a law firm had sent on its behalf to the Observer reporter, where it sought to contradict the statements of a former staffer profiled as a whistle blower in the Observer's coverage.","The Trump campaign denied using voter data from Cambridge Analytica, saying it relied on data from the Republican National Committee.","Cambridge Analytica, backed by top Trump donor and hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, claims it can predict how people will vote based on the 5,000 pieces of data it collects on nearly every American adult combined with the results of thousands of personality surveys. Enlisted by the Trump campaign, it touted its role as swinging the presidential election.","How it worked: by asking users to download a personality quiz app","Facebook said a British researcher and his firm, Global Science Research, legitimately gained access to the personal data of Facebook users in 2013 while working on a personality prediction app, but the researcher violated Facebook’s rules by passing it on to Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was asked in December to turn over documents to special counsel Robert Mueller, as part of his investigation into collusion between the campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","In 2015, Facebook learned that the researcher Kogan broke its policies by passing on the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies. Facebook says it was assured the information had been deleted, but received reports several days ago that it was not.","Wylie, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica is the whistleblower profiled by The Observer. He set up Eunoia Technologies after leaving Cambridge Analytica in late 2014.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” Facebook’s deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said in the Friday blog post. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.”","Facebook said it has suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie. Kogan and Wylie could not be reached for comment.","Facebook denies the harvesting of Facebook profiles constitutes a data breach, which would require Facebook to notify users in many states, including California where it's headquartered.","In a now deleted tweet, Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos said Saturday: \"Kogan did not break into any systems, bypass any technical controls, or use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed. He did, however, misuse that data after he gathered it, but that does not retroactively make it a 'breach.'\"","The Web Foundation, set up by Tim Berners-Lee to advocate for an open Internet, called for a full investigation and for all affected users to be notified. The Web Foundation also wants to know why Facebook didn't ban Cambridge Analytica sooner and what actions Facebook takes when a third party violates its rules.","\"Today’s story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica drives home why we need platforms to be fully transparent and accountable in the age of big data. Once our personal data is in someone else’s hands, it’s extremely difficult to take back control — with potentially disastrous results for public safety, discourse and democracy,\" Web Foundation's policy director Craig Fagan in a statement. \"Platforms must fully embrace their responsibility to do whatever it takes to keep user data safe from abuse.","In the fall, Mueller asked Cambridge Analytics to turn over emails of employees who worked on the Trump campaign, signaling the special counsel is probing the data operation.","Former senior White House strategist Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors and had a stake in the firm.","Mueller is investigating whether Trump associates colluded with Russian operatives to meddle in the election.

Nicholas Thompson, a CBS News contributor and editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, said on CBSN on Monday that Facebook was \"very upset\" about the use of the word \"breach\" in a headline in the British newspaper the Guardian, which first broke the story over the weekend.","The newspaper has continued to refer to the incident as a breach in subsequentstories. Their reporting exposed how Facebook users' data was initially obtained through an app that collected information on people who took a personality quiz and all their Facebook friends, supposedly for academic research purposes only. The data was then provided to Cambridge Analytica, which helped the Trump campaign during the 2016 Republican primaries.","Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth defended the company Saturday morning and denied that any \"data breach\" took place.","\"This was unequivocally not a data breach,\" Bosworth said. \"People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.\"","This was unequivocally not a data breach.

That’s especially true for the presidential election, when candidates must reach many millions of voters. People use social media all day, and it’s one of the main ways Americans get their political information. And when one candidate uses a voter-targeting tactic—buying voter lists, booking local TV spots, buying crate loads of Facebook ads—others have to do it too. No candidate in a tight campaign can afford to not use every possible tool to get in front of voters.","More than $1.4 billion was spent on online advertising by candidates in the 2016 election. Campaigns and super PACs supporting candidates poured money into digital ads that were fine-tuned to target specific demographics. Women in their 40s with kids who are Christian in the Midwest could receive different ads than a young male teen gamer in New York City—and they did, every time they hopped onto Twitter, Facebook, or any website that runs Google ads. Online ads are able to hit such specific subsets of people because they rely on a constellation of data collected from your browsing activity or things you like on Facebook, your location, credit card data, personal connections with friends, and other morsels of information. In theory, this corporate data collection could be subject to tighter regulation—for example, concerning the amount of time a user’s information is held.","Yet, as politicians increasingly rely on data-driven advertising and microtargeting of their constituents to win elections, it’s unlikely that the U.S. will ever see meaningful privacy legislation or regulation of big internet platforms—despite many reasons to be skeptical of how they use such data, not to mention the likelihood that Facebook, Google, and others’ data-targeting tools were manipulated by Russian government–backed forces in an effort to foment divisiveness and help Trump win the election.","As politicians increasingly rely on data-driven advertising and microtargeting, it’s unlikely that the U.S. will ever see meaningful privacy legislation.","This is similar to the cycle of campaign finance reform. Candidates on both sides of the aisle agree campaign finance laws need to be reformed, especially since the Citizens United decision in 2010 that ruled campaign contributions were a form of “political speech.” That ruling removed limits on the amount of money corporations and wealthy donors could shell out in support of a candidate and opened the floodgates to a surge of unaccounted for money in campaigns, mostly from super PACs, which are committees that are allowed to spend as much as they want in support of a particular candidate as long as they don’t work with that politician directly. Campaign finance reform, however, is notoriously difficult to enact because once the money starts to flow into a campaign, it’s very hard to convince beneficiaries to shut the faucet.","Privacy law and regulation of internet platforms are in a similar bind. The U.S. hasn’t substantially updated federal digital privacy law in 31 years, since the passage of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. The law holds, for example, that a warrant is not required to access emails stored online for more than 180 days, which means that if you keep your emails stored in webmail for years, the government can grab them without a warrant. In other words, police have to satisfy a much lower standard of reasoning to read your emails than if you printed them out and stored them in a desk drawer. The stagnation of digital privacy law isn’t due to a shortage of evidence showing online profiling can put users at risk.","Advertisement","Take what happened a decade ago when mortgage brokers were peddling dangerous subprime loans. During that time, financial companies were leveraging online behavior data with location and demographic data in order to deduce a person’s race. That in turn helped mortgage companies target minorities in their online marketing of bad financial products, which were sometimes referred to as “ghetto loans,” according to research from Seeta Peña Gangadharan, a professor of media and communications at the London School of Economics. Subprime lenders made the list of the top 10 spenders in online advertising in the U.S. in 2007 and 2008, according to Nielson/NetRatings data. Experian, for example spent $54 million in online advertising in 2008. The year before, in 2007, Gangadharan found Countrywide spent nearly $35 million in online advertising and Experian spent $43 million. Black wealth dropped by nearly 50 percent during the crisis, and black and Latino homeowners were about 70 percent more likely to lose their homes to foreclosure than whites.","Now that there’s strong evidence that these data-targeting systems were instrumentalized in an attempt by Kremlin-backed groups to manipulate voters and spread misinformation online in the run-up to the 2016 election, one would think that this would be the opportune time to start to regulate how personal data is collected and used to target individuals in harmful ways.","Looking at only six of the 470 accounts Facebook shared with Congress with alleged ties to a Kremlin-backed group that bought ads on the social network around the presidential election, Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, found that content from that small handful of accounts alone had been shared about 340 million times. Journalists have also found that both Facebook and Google allowed ad buyers to target people based on extremely bigoted categories. ProPublica found, for example, that Facebook let advertisers target people explicitly interested in topics like “how to burn jews” or “jew hater.” Slate likewise was able to target ads on Facebook to users interested in “kill Muslimic Radicals” or “threesome rape.” BuzzFeed similarly was able to buy ads on Google targeted at the keyword phrase “blacks ruin everything” and other racist slurs.","While the impacts of these corporate online ad-targeting practices in connection to the 2016 election are still being assessed, and Congress has even scheduled a public hearing to which it has invited Facebook, Google, and Twitter to testify on how their platforms were used by foreign entities to manipulate voters, it’s unlikely that any kind of meaningful regulation of these platforms or new data privacy laws will result.","“The RNC and DNC have databases that have over 900 points of data on every member of the electorate,” says Daniel Kreiss, a journalism professor at the University of North Carolina. “The core of that is that public data built around commercial marketing data about things like credit card purchases and grocery card purchases and magazine subscription lists.” That information is then bundled with data about party affiliation and voter turnout to target people on websites like Facebook, Kreiss explained.","There are, of course, many other reasons why Congress is unlikely to regulate online platforms beyond the fact that politicians themselves use data-driven online ads. Google is on track to be the largest corporate spender on lobbying in the U.S. this year, and executives from major tech companies are often massive donors to electoral campaigns. But still, Trump’s campaign spent $85 million on Facebook alone, according to Hong, who also wrote Trump’s Facebook posts. Republicans and Democrats alike are only poised to increase their spending on data-driven online voter targeting in future elections. And that means that no matter how pernicious the effects of microtargeting ads are, a practice that’s only possible through vast corporate data collection, the chances of Congress taking substantive action to abate those harms is slim."],"isopubdate":""}

Maybe even enough to fuel a voter-manipulation effort like the one a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm stands accused of — and which Facebook may have enabled.","The social network is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections.","Monday was a wild roller coaster ride for Facebook, whose shares plunged 7 percent in its worst one-day decline since 2014. Officials in the EU and the U.S. sought answers, while Britain's information commissioner said she will seek a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica's servers because the British firm had been \"uncooperative\" in her investigation. The first casualty of that investigation was an audit of Cambridge that Facebook had announced earlier in the day; the company said it \"stood down\" that effort at the request of British officials.","Adding to the turmoil, the New York Times reported that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will step down by August following clashes over how aggressively Facebook should address its role in spreading disinformation. In a tweet , Stamos said he's still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed.","It would have been quieter had Facebook likes not turned out to be so revealing. Researchers in a 2013 study found that likes on hobbies, interests and other attributes can predict personal attributes such as sexual orientation and political affiliation. Computers analyze such data to look for patterns that might not be obvious, such as a link between a preference for curly fries and higher intelligence.","Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, said the firm used such techniques to learn about individuals and create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. In doing so, he said, the firm \"took fake news to the next level.\"","\"This is based on an idea called 'informational dominance,' which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what's actually happening,\" Wylie said Monday on NBC's \"Today.\" It's not yet clear exactly how the firm might have attempted to do that.","Late Friday, Facebook said Cambridge improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded an app described as a personality test. Those people agreed to share data with the app for research — not for political targeting. And the data included who their Facebook friends were and what they liked — even though those friends hadn't downloaded the app or given explicit consent.","Cambridge got limited information on the friends, but machines can use detailed answers from smaller groups to make good inferences on the rest, said Kenneth Sanford of the data science company Dataiku.","Cambridge was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, and at one point employed Stephen Bannon — later President Donald Trump's campaign chairman and White House adviser — as a vice president. The Trump campaign paid Cambridge roughly $6 million according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work.","The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common, but is typically used to sell diapers and other products. Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person's viewing behaviors fit with what other customers watch.","But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it's connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media.","Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to \"explore mental vulnerabilities of people.\" He said the firm \"works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.\"","Wylie told \"Today\" that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge effort aimed to make sure people wouldn't know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.","The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge's data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing, and says it didn't retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn't use it in its 2016 campaign work.","Yet Cambridge boasted of its work after another client, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, won the Iowa caucus in 2016.","Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz from similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use.","Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages. For voters who care about tradition, it could push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might have described keeping guns for protection against crime.","It's possible that Cambridge tapped other data sources, including what Cruz's campaign app collected. Nix said during the Cruz campaign that it had five or six sources of data on each voter.","Facebook declined to provide officials for interview and didn't immediately respond to requests for information beyond its statements Friday and Monday. Cambridge also didn't immediately respond to emailed questions.","Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. Facebook's mapping of the \"social graph\" — essentially the web of people's real-life connections — is also invaluable for marketers.","For example, researchers can look at people's clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. People who bridge different friend networks, for example, can have more influence when they post something, making them prime for targeting.","Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according on Pew Research Center. While people don't exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the \"rabbit hole\" of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described.","___","An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the sum paid by the 2016 Trump campaign to Cambridge Analytica.

Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said last week of rumors of the FTC action, “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”","The controversy has roiled company stock, and the announcement Monday of the federal agency probe sent the company’s stock sliding even further, down nearly four points at its lowest midday trading point.","Cambridge Analytica has previously said it was unaware the data was improperly obtained by a third party, and the firm says it cooperated with Facebook in deleting all the social media company’s data and related information in 2015. Such material was not utilized as part of its work with the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, the data firm said.","The Trump campaign has said it never used data from Cambridge Analytica.\nThe Judiciary Committee, for its part, said it plans to cover “privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use. It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Grassley also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss mounting privacy concerns and “how to develop ‘rules of the road’ that encourage companies to develop tailored approaches to privacy that satisfy consumer expectations while maintaining incentives for innovation.”","Pressure is building for Zuckerberg, in particular, to face what will surely be a series of public grillings, as the list of congressional panels demanding his appearance grows.","Already, the embattled billionaire businessman has received requests from the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has said it intends to extend an invite, as its panel continues its more than 14-month long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.","There are also international demands for Zuckerberg to appear before government panels in the UK, Australia, and beyond.","“On a bipartisan basis, we believe Mr. Zuckerberg’s testimony is necessary to gain a better understanding of how the company plans to restore lost trust, safeguard users’ data, and end a troubling series of belated responses to serious problems,” Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, said last week in a joint statement.","Some in Congress have even begun to threaten regulation of an industry that has long fought against any curb of its activities.","“These tech platforms who are extraordinarily powerful who’ve been great iconic American success stories - they need to be more forthcoming or Washington is going to start imposing rules and regulations that may not fit,” warned Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and, himself, a former tech industry entrepreneur and investor.","Warner, who had just months ago insisted on a “light touch” to try to press Silicon Valley into action, has seemed to grow more frustrated with the tech CEO’s since last year, when Facebook, Google, and Twitter sent their top lawyers – instead of coming themselves – to the Intelligence panel to testify regarding their role in Russia’s 2016 interference.","“Facebook has -since the beginning of this investigation - have been reluctant, to say the least, to be fully forthcoming,” Warner said, adding, “I think it’s time for the CEO, Mr. Zuckerberg, and other top officials to come and testify and not tell part of the story but tell the whole story of their involvement, not only with the Trump campaign but their ability to have their platform misused by the Russians.”","Last Thursday, Facebook sent a handful of senior staff to brief aides to a number of key Senate and House committees on the most recent controversy.","The same panels on both sides of Congress who are demanding that Zuckerberg appear also want to hear from Cambridge Analytica executives, including its now-suspended CEO Alexander Nix and former data firm employee Christopher Wylie. The latter told ABC News that he had already accepted House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence’s invitation.","“One of the reasons why I’m speaking out is because I think that it’s really concerning that no one has really investigated Cambridge Analytica and its role in the 2016 election,” Wylie told ABC News in a recent interview.","Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence panel, also invited Russian-American researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who developed the initial app approved by Facebook to collect data on 227,000 of its users.","Kogan previously told ABC News that Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are making him a “scapegoat.”","ABC News also reported Monday that Government watchdog group Common Cause filed a pair of legal complaints with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the Department of Justice accusing Cambridge Analytica LTD, its parent company SCL Group Limited, CEO Alexander Nix, SCL co-founder Nigel Oakes, data scientist Alexander Tayler, and former employee-turned-whistleblower Christopher Wylie of violating federal election laws that prohibit foreigners from participating directly or indirectly in the decision-making process of U.S. political campaigns."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

And it just got even worse for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The British House of Commons has officially sent Zuck a letter asking him to come to London and testify about how he plans to “fix” Facebook. Best of luck with that, mate.","The letter, which was just published to Twitter by technology reporters in the UK, explains that the government committee overseeing digital privacy had already heard from Facebook officials, but that those representatives from the social media company had been “misleading.”","Advertisement","The UK now wants a high-level executive, preferably Zuckerberg himself, to go to London and testify about the “catastrophic failure” of Facebook’s handling of private user information.","The letter reads:","Dear Mr Zuckerberg","Request for oral evidence","Following material published in the UK Guardian and the New York Times over the past few days, the Committee would like to request that you appear before us to give oral evidence.","As I said in my statement, the Committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent. Your officials’ answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the Committee.","It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process. There is a strong public interest test regarding user protection. Accordingly we are sure you will understand the need for a representative from right at the top of the oganisation to address concerns. Given your committment at the start of the New Year to “fixing” Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.","We would like to receive your response by Monday 26 March.","Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter. Update, 1:09pm: Facebook just sent us this statement from Paul Grewal, VP and Deputy General Counsel:","We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.","Advertisement","The House of Commons will already be hearing from a former Facebook employee as early as tomorrow. Sandy Parakilas worked on the security team at the social media company and told the Guardian in an article published today that he tried to warn Facebook about the potential for data breaches. Parakilas paints a dark picture of an information gathering free-for-all by incredibly shady characters.","“Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on,” Parakilas told the Guardian.","Facebook has come under increased scrutiny in the past few days after it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica used the data of over 50 million Facebook users to exploit their fears and launch a sophisticated propaganda campaign on behalf of Donald Trump’s team.","Advertisement","And to make things even worse for Facebook, it also came to light just yesterday that Cambridge Analytica engages in some pretty dirty business practices. Britain’s Channel Four ran a 20-minute documentary with undercover footage of the company’s CEO admitting that the company orchestrates bribes of politicians with the explicit purpose of filming those encounters and releasing the footage online.","The company’s CEO, Alexander Nix, also admits to bringing sex workers from Ukraine into various countries in order to entice government officials with sex. Those encounters are also filmed and used to discredit candidates around the world, Nix says in the video.","And if that wasn’t enough, the rumor mill is now swirling with reports that Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer, is resigning over disagreements with other top executives at the media company. Specifically, Stamos is reportedly upset that Facebook isn’t being more upfront about the ways its platform was used to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election.","The New York Times reports that Stamos wanted to quit but was “persuaded to stay” until August. Top leadership at Facebook apparently thought it would look bad to have Stamos jump ship while the ship was on fire. Which isn’t altogether wrong.","Facebook’s stock price plummeted yesterday on news that the company is imploding. And Facebook plans to hold a company-wide meeting today to discuss the shitshow. But we’ll see if it can pull out of this nosedive.","Advertisement","With Zuck himself totally silent, it should be interesting to see how he responds to a request to testify in the UK. So far, the US hasn’t formally asked top social media executives to testify, though that could be changing. Democratic Senator Mark Warner tweeted that he’d like to see Zuck and other CEOs testify in front of Congress. With the shit truly hitting the fan, the days of hiding behind lawyers on Capitol Hill may be over for people like Mark Zuckerberg."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

The answer is that several technologies which have existed for decades must not only merge but actually function towards improving the quality or costs (value) of the four patient outcomes produced and manufactured between patients and their physicians (prevention, medical, surgical and palliative). Only when the cycle of population health data collection, tabulation, revelation and reapplication is functional will Precision Medicine have arrived. The components of the cycle of Precision Medicine must include;","1) HIT EMR/EHR and billing systems which are standardized and integrated via common encoded API allowing providers to communicate and share data in real time. Interoperability and encoded decentralized data sharing (think blockchain) would also reveal the preventative, medical, surgical and palliative outcomes of the entire population of patients according to all contributing and non-contributing variables contained in the patient records. Currently EHR companies sell patient data for profit to ancillary industry's and refuse to or reveal that data to benefit patients or their physicians.","2) Mobile Devices for diagnostics and treatments used by patients must be standardized and integrated via common encoded API into the patient population HIT accessible for both physicians and their patients.","3) Clinical Research Data, especially that funded by taxpayers will be available online in real time as it is charted for all the world to parse. Federal Laws passed in 1994 and 2007 to upload reproduced research results without delay to the www are currently being ignored by researchers and industry.","4) Physicians, Institutions and Therapists will compete capitalistically based on the quality and price of the clinical outcomes they produce with patients. Population and outcome data will improve under performers via quality control.","5) Pharmaceutical, insurance and medical device corporations will compete capitalistically based on the quality and price of the outcomes their products produce with patients and their physicians. Pharmaceutical and Insurance Incs will provide seamless drug formulary integration and prices into all EMR's EHR's and mobile apps for patients and their doctors to use at the POINT of CARE. Pharmaceutical Management Groups (PMG's) will stop blocking price and drug formulary data from doctors & patients relieving the scourge of prior authorization rationing.","6) Data revealed from the above standardized interoperable decentralized EMR/EHR and billing population health data will be used to develop new digital, mobile, behavioral, molecular, somatic and genetic modes of diagnostics and treatments to improve the quality and costs of the four clinical outcomes. Precision medicine will then improve patient outcomes and costs consistent with Moores Law.","When the above cycle of data Collection, Tabulation, Revelation and Reapplication (CTRR) is completed and functional improving clinical value=outcomes/costs, true precision medicine will have arrived.

As long as optimizing value=outcomes/cost solutions are proprietary and diminish the EBITDA of the big 5 (insurance, pharmaceutical, med mal, hospital, EHR) industries then blockchain type based decentralized interoperable encoded population health benefiting patients and physicians won't happen.

{"originalurl":"http://financefollow.com/2018/03/facebook-makes-its-privacy-data-downloading-and-deletion-settings-easier-to-find/","title":"Facebook makes its privacy, data downloading and deletion settings easier to find – Finance Follow","text":["With Facebook facing a wave of public backlash over how it has handled user data over the years — a backlash that was kicked off two weeks ago with the revelation that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had worked on targeted election campaigns using personal and private Facebook data — the company today announced a new set of changes to help users find and change their privacy settings, as well as download and delete whatever data has been collected through Facebook’s network of social media services.","To be clear, many of these settings and features already existed in Facebook, but now Facebook is making them significantly clearer for the average user to find and use. It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe.","What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.)","We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front.","For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place:","User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now.","Privacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that.","Downloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.","The news comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week posting an acknowledgement of Facebook’s role in the scandal, and a pledge to improve the company’s practices with regards to third-party apps and how Facebook works with them, and what data it will provide in the future, which he also followed up with a full-page apology printed in several newspapers. It has not been enough for some, and #deletefacebook has become a trending concept, with the company’s stock taking a nosedive in the last two weeks."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Per the Times: “Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.”","Said researcher is — wait for it — a Russian-American!!","And how did we learn all this? Did Facebook conduct an internal inquiry into how the platform may have been inappropriately or illegally used to influence the 2016 election? Since we already know that it was?","Haha: I’m joking, of course.","The Times said Facebook “downplayed the scope of the leak” as its reporters pressed for answers. And when the social media giant actually checked — suddenly they were really alarmed! (There are also lots of other questions: Why would Facebook release this to an academic anyway? Wouldn’t an academic who could pay for that kind of scaled information raise alarm bells?)","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice president and deputy general counsel, said in a statement to the Times, adding that they’d suspended both Cambridge Analytica and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan.","In the words of Russian spyspeak, Zuckerberg now counts — like our president — as a “useful idiot.” He has contributed, and apparently continues to contribute, to the corruption of our democratic process. The Times reports that Cambridge Analytica still has “most or all” of the data.","Meanwhile, Facebook rakes in billions of dollars in profit each quarter — $7.3 billion in the last quarter of 2017 — while sucking advertising dollars away from digital media companies that do actual journalism, like Vox and Mic and Buzzfeed.","Do I sound furious? I am.","I’m sure I don’t need to remind anybody that when the government asked Facebook to check on Russian-backed ads during the presidential election, Zuckerberg at first said he didn’t think it was a thing. The notion that fake news on Facebook influenced the election is “a pretty crazy idea,” he said in November 2016. (No, really: Watch the video.)","Then Facebook checked and found that hundreds of fake Facebook accounts, probably run from Russia, spent about $100,000 on ads about divisive issues such as gun control and race relations during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. By now we’ve all seen those ads trotted out in Congressional hearing rooms.","Once again we must thank the Fourth Estate, in this case the New York Times, for digging out information that Facebook would rather not have shared.","Mark Zuckerberg, the Times has exposed you for your naivete and cowardice. We, your users, need to take action — like getting off your platform. Your actions are tepid, late and lacking in credibility.","Sheryl Sandberg, you know better, what are you doing to fix this?","I’m not a fan of government regulation in general, but we need it here, and now comes word of a U.S. Attorney General investigation. That’s a start. We need our legislators to step in and regulate Facebook. Stick their nose in. Pass rules. Make Facebook accountable, because for the moment, it’s just a wild oligopoly driven by mad growth and madder profit.","Public accountablity becomes harder when our government is paralyzed, divided and utterly broken. And it is that way — in part because of the divisions that foreign actors sowed on Facebook during our election.","Our democracy is precious. It is strong, but it has fault lines that Russia has clearly exploited. The geniuses of Silicon Valley, changing everything in our world, need to get a lot more transparent, a lot more thoughtful and a lot more accountable for what they have wrought.","Until they do, I recommend we give Facebook a wide berth.","Misinformation in 2016: A Timeline of Fake News (Photos)","Hopefully we'll look back at 2016 as that weird year when fake news stories oddly garnered influence over the voting population of the country.

The plaintiffs argued that this violated federal and state privacy and wiretapping laws.","US district judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California, dismissed the case because he said that the plaintiffs failed to show that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy or suffered any realistic economic harm or loss.","Davila said that plaintiffs could have taken steps to keep their browsing histories private, for example by using the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out tool or using “incognito mode”, and failed to show that Facebook illegally “intercepted” or eavesdropped on their communications.","Here's how to protect your internet browsing data now that it's for sale","Read more","“Facebook’s intrusion could have easily been blocked, but plaintiffs chose not to do so,” said Davila, who dismissed an earlier version of the five-year-old case in October 2015.","Clicking on the Facebook “like” button on a third party website – for example, theguardian.com – allows people to share pieces of content to Facebook without having to copy and paste the link into a status update on the social network.","When a user visits a page with an embedded “like” button, the web browser sends information to both Facebook and the server where the page is located.","“The fact that a user’s web browser automatically sends the same information to both parties does not establish that one party intercepted the user’s communication with the other,” said Davila.","The plaintiffs cannot bring privacy and wiretapping claims again, Davila said, but can pursue a breach of contract claim again.","Australian internet security blogger Nik Cubrilovic first discovered that Facebook was apparently tracking users’ web browsing after they logged off in 2011. Responding to Cubrilovic, Facebook engineer Gregg Stefancik confirmed that Facebook has cookies that persist after log-out as a safety measure (to prevent others from trying to access the account) but that the company does not use the cookies to track users or sell personal information to third parties.","However, in 2014 Facebook started using web browsing data for delivering targeted “interest-based” advertising – which explains why you see ads for products you have already been looking at online appear in your Facebook feed.","To address privacy concerns, Facebook introduced a way for users to opt out of this type of advertising targeting from within user settings.","“We are pleased with the court’s ruling,” said a Facebook spokeswoman."],"isopubdate":"2017-07-03"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan's company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared.","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR \"was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analyticadeleted all data received from GSR,\" he said.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" the spokesman said.","He said \"no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","$6.2 million from Trump campaign","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica.","\"Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign.","He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it \"provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.\"","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","\"We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,\" Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports \"important and powerful\" but said it was \"incorrect to call this a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\"","\"We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,\" he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was \"more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West\" and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses \"behavioral microtargeting,\" or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called \"research app\" that used Facebook's login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people.

In short, what was Mark Zuckerberg thinking?","What makes recent disclosures about illicit uses of Facebook data so exasperating to opinion leaders and millions of everyday users is the delayed, disingenuous and tone-deaf responses from corporate management. It took five days from the publication of bombshell exposés in the New York Times and Observer, during which Facebook shed nearly $50 billion in market value, before the company’s two top executives finally issued what was widely considered to be an inadequate response.","During the protracted silence from Facebook’s CEO and COO, other senior company executives took to Twitter and Facebook to deny corporate culpability. One post vigorously disputed that Facebook’s systems had been breached, insisting on a technically correct, but blame-shifting explanation: “This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","This semantics lesson on the meaning of “breach” provided little comfort to users, who rarely parse the fine print in Facebook’s terms of service, and in any event expect Facebook to protect their private data from harmful and unauthorized use. As Mark Zuckerberg finally acknowledged in his long-awaited response (on Facebook of course), “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. “","In another instance of Facebook’s inadequate initial response, a Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast, “The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”","But Facebook’s outrage was too little, too late, as the cause of the company’s breach of trust should have been recognized and forcefully addressed over three years earlier. In 2014, a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan gave a publicized speech in Singapore, describing how he was able to analyze a sample of over 50 million Facebook users for whom he developed “the ability to predict virtually any trait.” Kogan also boasted of having built a database of every friendship made in the world on Facebook from 2006-2012.","One year later, The Guardian published a detailed account of how campaign consultancy Cambridge Analytica − who had paid to gain access to Kogan’s massive database on unwitting US Facebook users − was using detailed psychological profiles on the US electorate for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. In response, Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to certify (as in “check the box on this form”) that they had destroyed the ill-gotten user data. But Facebook failed to pursue any forensic follow up to ensure that this dangerously potent asset had in fact been wiped clean.","In early 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, and paid the firm over $6 million with the remit to provide a wide range of services including data analytics, voter profiling, micro-targeting, social media message development, digital marketing and campaign planning. Did Cambridge Analytica continue to use its ill-gotten massive Facebook database on behalf of the Trump campaign? Circumstantial evidence certainly points in that direction. Whistleblower Chris Wylie has recounted that Cambridge Analytica board member Steve Bannon had exhorted employees to weaponize psychological profiling in a self-proclaimed “win-at-any-cost” culture war being fought on the 2016 election battlefield. The Financial Times reported that Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, boasted of using “a massive database of [nearly] 5,000 data points on every adult in America” to support the successful Trump campaign. And immediately after the election, Cambridge Analytica took credit for the win, claiming that its data helped to place targeted online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times.","In his belated mea culpa, Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook “made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.” But the company’s track record of systemic failures to protect user privacy or to prevent malevolent uses of its proprietary database suggests that were it not for investigative reporting by the New York Times, Observer and undercover reporting by Channel 4 News in London, we probably would not be having an urgent public discourse on Facebook’s management shortcomings today.","Why has Facebook consistently struggled to protect its users’ personal information and to prevent malicious exploitation of its platform?","Going forward, can we trust Facebook to “take whatever steps are required” to address serious concerns with their business practices?","The most common answer to the first question is that Facebook’s business model inexorably drives their observed behavior. After all, Facebook’s success is built on amassing (or less charitably, surveilling) information on consumer behavior, enabling it to sell targeted advertising that delivers superior marketing ROI. This devilishly effective business model has enabled Facebook to create an extraordinarily profitable enterprise – in round numbers, a $50 billion revenue run rate, growing at 50% per year with 50% operating margins. It is thus not surprising that the company would be reluctant to tinker with such successful business practices.","The Perfect Storm Behind Mark Zuckerberg’s Corporate Myopia","But there is deeper dynamic at play that explains Facebook’s chronic inability to recognize the potential societal harm and reputational risk that its platform can and has engendered. Mark Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia results from the perfect storm of three leadership mindsets.","Hubristic vision and soaring ambition to change the world for the better","Overconfidence in the power of technology to solve virtually any problem","A tendency to underestimate “black swan” risks","While these management mindsets are not uncommon in Silicon Valley, when applied in a company of Facebook’s scale, the consequences can be catastrophic.","Mark Zuckerberg passionately believes that the company he founded nearly fifteen years ago has emerged as a uniquely powerful global force for good. He has often proclaimed that the Internet should be considered, like health care and clean water, a basic human right. And within that realm, Zuckerberg regards peer-to-peer communications as a powerful enabler of the company’s mission to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”","Guided by such an altruistic vision, Zuckerberg propelled Facebook’s rapid growth by aggressively pursuing more data, more media, more interactions inside and beyond the platform, more functionality, more user engagement and more global scale and reach. But in retrospect, the company’s fateful error was Zuckerberg’s decision to share user data with outside app developers starting in 2008 (expanded further between 2011 and 2014) in exchange for enhancing Facebook’s functionality and the ability to track its users beyond its platform. By extending Facebook’s surveillance beyond the walled garden of internally generated user data, the company signaled its preference for more data acquisition and portability over safeguarding user privacy.","MAU growthAuthor analysis from company data","Along the way, Facebook certainly was aware of “bad actors” on its platform − the ones that bully users, plant fake news for profit, mindless fun or influence, or who promote fraudulent commerce. But Zuckerberg has consistently exuded confidence that his company’s sophisticated software could detect and prevent malevolent abuses on his platform, despite alarming evidence that Facebook’s bad actor problem has been worsening for years.","There were plenty of reasons for Zuckerberg to overlook danger signs bubbling below the surface of Facebook’s business. By any measure, Facebook had been spectacularly successful in creating a global juggernaut. By the end of 2017, Facebook was serving over 2 billion users and more than 5 million advertisers, rewarding shareholders (including its largest stakeholder, Mark Zuckerberg) with a company valued in excess of one-half trillion dollars.","Such outsized success undoubtedly contributed to Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia in failing to recognize and mitigate the risks of rare, but potentially catastrophic abuses on his platform. Best-selling author and scholar Nassim Taleb has written extensively on the common human tendency to underestimate the likelihood of “black swan” events − defined as situations with low probability but extremely high downside risk. For example, black swan myopia arguably contributed to the lax risk management that led to a number of preventable disasters, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the financial services meltdown of 2008.","In Facebook’s case, black swan myopia led Mark Zuckerberg to largely ignore the reputational risk posed by the malevolent use of Facebook user data before, during and after the 2016 presidential election. Before Cambridge Analytica even began working for the Trump campaign, Facebook failed to verify that the consultancy had actually destroyed its large illicit cache of Facebook user data. During the campaign, Facebook continued to ignore growing reports that the Trump campaign was effectively deploying psychological profiling and micro-targeting techniques, rife with fake news and targeted imagery in pivotal swing states.","And even after President Trump’s gobsmacking victory, Zuckerberg continued to proclaim that the notion that fake news could have influenced the U.S. presidential election was a \"pretty crazy idea,\" going on to dismiss the importance of filter bubbles and claiming that fake news represents a \"very small volume\" of the total content on Facebook’s platform.","Zuckerberg’s stubborn denial of the ability of Cambridge Analytica and other foreign political operatives to exploit Facebook’s data and platform to influence voter behavior is bizarrely hypocritical, since the secret sauce that has always driven Facebook’s profitability is its proven ability to enable advertisers to precisely tailor product messaging to targeted prospective customers.","According to whistleblower Chris Wylie, Steve Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the stated objective of using psychological profiling tools to change voters’ cultural attitudes. In fighting a self-proclaimed culture war, Bannon understood that micro-targeting − akin to smart bombs − could be far more cost effective than carpet bombing political ads on mass media. Cambridge Analytica arguably was in a position to be particularly effective in this regard because they illicitly gained the access to Facebook’s vast user database to build detailed psychological profiling models.","Mark Zuckerberg is not alone in falling prey to the perfect storm of corporate myopia. One could argue that Travis Kalanick at Uber and Elizabeth Holmes at Theranos also had hubristic visions to change the world for the better, coupled with overconfidence in the infallibility of their technology and an inability to recognize black swan risks threatening to damage their company and the world at large. Kalanick was ultimately forced to resign from Uber by his board, and Holmes recently settled a lawsuit with the SEC that forced her to forfeit control of Theranos, now in tatters.","There are of course key differences in Zuckerberg’s case. Unlike the other two executives, Facebook has been spectacularly profitable, and Zuckerberg enjoys bulletproof shareholder control of his company. Under these circumstances, the question is, how will Mark Zuckerberg address the growing challenges threatening Facebook’s future?","Can Zuckerberg Clean Up Facebook’s Mess?","The key to answering this question lies in understanding what problem Mark Zuckerberg will choose to address: quelling the current uproar over the Cambridge Analytica debacle, or addressing broader, longstanding concerns with Facebook’s unprecedented global power to control access to information hiding behind its opaque business practices.","Zuckerberg’s mea culpa media tour starting March 21st clearly signaled his primary interest on the first problem. In his interview with Recode’s Kara Swisher, Zuckerberg opined “the good news is that as of three or four years ago, new apps weren’t able to do what happened here. So this is largely ... this issue is resolved going forward for a while.” As Swisher rightfully observed, Zuckerberg’s comments were predominantly backward-looking, and inadequately recognized the broader challenges that lie ahead.","By focusing Facebook’s attention on tracking down possible terms of service violations by thousands of third party developers many years ago, and promising new controls on developer platform access, Zuckerberg framed Facebook’s problem entirely in terms of external data portability, ignoring the fact that through these interactions, Facebook also amassed and retains extensive data on user behavior for its own commercial purposes.","Worries over just how much user data Facebook routinely collects and how that information is used erupted again this week when press accounts revealed that Facebook has been logging Android users’ telephone calls and SMS messages for years. As with prior concerns expressed over the company’s expansive data capture, Facebook reprised its typical response: “we never sell your data and trust us, having all this information helps us provide a better user experience on our platform.”","But a growing chorus of political leaders no longer trusts Facebook’s blame-shifting apologies and repeated assurances of altruistic intent, and are now calling for the company’s CEO to testify before Congress on a broad range of data privacy concerns. The FTC has also weighed in, opening an investigation to determine whether Facebook’s business practices have been violating a 2011 agreement settling charges over the company’s user privacy policies.","So how can we expect Facebook to respond? Given Mark Zuckerberg’s management mindset, and the company’s track record in dealing with past crises, it would take overwhelming pressure from the government or other key stakeholders for Facebook to move beyond reactive tweaks to its business practices. The harsh reality is, Facebook’s stakeholders are unlikely to mount a serious and sustained challenge to the company’s status quo.","Users","The potential for a user revolt clearly poses the gravest threat to Facebook’s market dominance, which explains why Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have devoted so much of their apology tour last week seeking to restore user trust. Facebook executives are well aware that Uber reportedly lost as much as 15 percentage points of market share in major US metro markets last year after a #deleteuber campaign erupted over the company’s alleged mishandling of its response to protests over President Trump’s Muslim country travel ban. In Uber’s case, consumers had a readily available choice to switch to a competitor (Lyft) offering an essentially comparable service.","Facebook’s situation is considerably different. Despite the genuine outrage expressed over recent damaging revelations, isolated calls to #deletefacebook have failed to gain much traction simply because Facebook is too deeply embedded in the lives of its 2 billion users. Consciously or unwittingly, the vast majority of Facebook users appear to have accepted the Faustian bargain of trading their personal data for free access to Facebook’s valued services. Don’t expect many Facebook or Instagram users to switch to Snapchat any time soon.","Advertisers","As long as users remain engaged on the platform, advertisers will be understandably reluctant to exclude Facebook from their advertising mix. No platform provides nearly as much market reach, targeting effectiveness or useful ROI tracking tools as Facebook. Consequently, why would Facebook’s 5 million advertisers be willing to cede such advantages to competitors? While a few companies have in fact announced a temporary suspension of Facebook advertising (e.g., Pep Boys, Sonos, Commerzbank), Facebook is likely to remain a dominant a channel for most advertisers in the months ahead.","Investors/Government","As long as users and advertisers stay on board, many investors are likely to follow suit. Facebook’s recent loss of market value largely reflects current investor nervousness over the prospect for restrictive government regulation. Mark Zuckerberg surprisingly fanned the flames of investor concern by signaling his support for appropriate regulatory controls.","But there are reasons to doubt that government action will be swift, comprehensive or overly damaging to Facebook’s business model. For starters, President Trump will obviously seek to discourage debate on an issue that relitigates the legitimacy of his 2016 election. On Capitol Hill, Congress already has a full agenda of more pressing political issues to deal with, going into the 2018 midterm elections. As such, today’s announcement that the FTC is launching an investigation of Facebook may give Congress cover to pass the baton in dealing with this gnarly issue.","It would not be surprising to see Facebook voluntarily announcing a few enhancements to its data privacy policies in the coming months to diminish the perceived urgency for comprehensive government regulation. These dynamics suggest that government action is likely to be slow and measured at best, giving investors time to monitor and react to Facebook’s actual financial performance in the months ahead, which promises to remain strong.","Board of directors","Facebook has a distinguished board that in normal circumstances could be counted on to exert strong oversight over the company's operational and reputational risk management. But a board can go only so far in reining in a CEO who controls 60% of the voting shares of the fifth largest publicly traded company in the world. Mark Zuckerberg will continue to be the loudest voice in the room in guiding Facebook’s strategic direction.","Competitors","What competitors? Facebook has exploited strong network economies of scale and a relentless appetite to acquire or replicate the services of upstart competitors. While it is true that Facebook will likely be barred from additional major acquisitions, the company has already built a seemingly unassailable lead over competitors in the advertising-supported social media space. Even if Congress does act to impose limits on future user data sourcing and portability, it may actually strengthen Facebook’s current competitive advantage given that it already has by far the biggest user database in the industry.","So where does that leave us? In the months ahead, we’re likely to see a number of incremental improvements in Facebook’s business practices through a combination of voluntary company policy changes and possible regulatory reforms governing the allowable sourcing and use of personal data.","Greater transparency in identifying the sponsors and content of targeted ads on Facebook’s platform (particularly those involving political content)","Tighter controls over user data portability across the Internet","More stringent requirements for users to be asked for opt-in permission (in clear language) before Facebook can collect and store user data.","These welcome changes will not unduly crimp Facebook’s extraordinarily successful business model, and may even help Mark Zuckerberg overcome his corporate myopia that has exposed the company to preventable reputational risk in the past. Whether we “Like” it or not, we’re destined to live in the social media world we collectively helped Facebook build for many more years to come.","I am an Executive in Residence and Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, teaching courses in business strategy and corporate entrepreneurship.

Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.","Cambridge Analytica boasts of dirty tricks to swing elections","Read more","The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analyticato determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.","The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.","“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.","The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unlikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.","On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.","“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.","The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.","Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.","Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.","Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.","Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”","The Times reported that Stamos’ responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August.","“Alex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.”","Stamos is one of a small handful of Facebook executives who addressed the data harvesting scandal on Twitter over the weekend while Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said nothing."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

But it's not just baby pictures and relationship status updates. Facebook is a hub for business.","Businesses of all sizes use Facebook to cultivate followers, build their brands, engage with their audience and maybe even manage employees. Karen North, professor at USC’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, joined Marketplace Weekend to discuss how businesses use Facebook for marketing and data collection.","1. Facebook is a powerful marketing tool. The vast and extremely valuable cache of data Facebook collects from user profiles has been a major asset for businesses when it comes to targeted marketing and reaching the right audience. Facebook is in the business of keeping user attention on the site; the network wants to keep users happy and engaged, and it uses personal information to craft a unique experience. For businesses, all that data is a treasure trove.","2. Not all businesses are collecting data of their own. Cambridge Analytica's app allegedly mined and misused Facebook user data. But many businesses aren't collecting data on the platform, they're using Facebook's data to sell their own product or push their message out.","3. Facebook isn't the only option. Facebook-owned Instagram is already a major contender in the advertising space. North says that Pinterest is also very effective (though not much discussed) and that Twitter, while not great for reaching customers, is a good tool for reaching influencers.","4. What matters most is the content. Advertising in the digital era takes a lot of creativity and, most importantly, authenticity. Regardless of which platform they're using or which social network they're tapping into, businesses will have to focus on creating high-quality campaigns. That goes for the future of business on Facebook, too, maybe especially during a time of heightened skepticism.","“I think the best compliment I can give is not to say how much your programs have taught me (a ton), but how much Marketplace has motivated me to go out and teach myself.” – Michael in Arlington, VA","As a nonprofit news organization, what matters to us is the same thing that matters to you: being a source for trustworthy, independent news that makes people smarter about business and the economy.

The consulting company has been linked with Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the Leave.EU campaign as part of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union.","The app developer, Aleksandr Kogan, requested and gained access to information from users who downloaded his app, “thisisyourdigitallife” on Facebook, which billed itself as “a research app used by psychologists.”","Up to 270,000 Facebook users downloaded the app – giving Kogan consent to access data, such as the city they live in or content they “Liked” on Facebook. However, in 2015, Facebook also enabled developers to collect data on the Facebook Friend networks for users – meaning that when users agreed to show their data to Kogan, he could also access data about their Friends. This means that overall, Kogan was able to access the data from up to 50 million Facebook users.","Facebook said it removed the app from the platform in 2015, but a bombshell article in The Guardian over the weekend put former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie in the spotlight, who said that Facebook was aware of Kogan’s app pulling an enormous amount of data – but had been told that it was for research purposes, instead of being fed to Cambridge Analytica.","“Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” said Paul Grewal, VP and deputy general counsel at Facebook in a statement.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information,” said Grewal.","Despite these steps, critics have come forward, angry that app developers can jump through loopholes and collect data, similar to Kogan, all while being perfectly within Facebook’s rules and guidelines. On top of these concerns, the company did not inform users whose data had been harvested.","Facebook has come under scrutiny from political actors about how it handles data privacy and the implications for end users of the popular social media platform.","U.S. Senator Mark R. Warner, who serves as vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said that authorities need to bring transparency and accountability when it comes to online political advertisements and data:”Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said in a statement.","Meanwhile, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey on Saturday announced she was launching a state investigation into the matter.","Others, like Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal, called for public open hearings for Facebook, saying that the company’s failure to secure privacy of data “seems a breach of trust and even law.”","Facebook's failure to secure privacy of private data – that it released – seems a breach of trust and even law. Judiciary Committee should hold open hearings, with Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and others, under oath and in public.","Top Facebook executives also took to Twitter to fire back, arguing that privacy violations did not exist as no passwords were stolen or hacked. Andrew Bosworth, VP of AR and VR at Facebook, was one such executive, who tweeted that “this was unequivocally not a data breach.”","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","Cambridge Analytica has responded to Facebook’s post, blaming Kogan for violating the social media’s rules and saying it deleted the data when it learned of the issue two years ago: “Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and ​is currently ​in touch with Facebook ​following its ​recent statement​ that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible​,” it said in a statement.","Wylie, for his part, on Sunday said that he was suspended from Facebook for acting as a whistleblower “on something they [Facebook] have known privately for 2 years.”","Moving forward, Facebook said in a statement that it would continue to work to ensure compliance with its privacy policies, including random audits of existing apps and proactive monitoring of fast growing apps.","“We enforce our policies in a variety of ways — from working with developers to fix the problem, to suspending developers from our platform, to pursuing litigation,” said the company.

Newspaper reports that a UK political consultancy used millions of user profiles creates fresh risks at the social network he founded. People are already spending less time on Facebook. The danger is that members may unfriend it altogether.","Facebook lost more than $35 billion of its value on Monday after reports said that more than 50 million people had their personal data misappropriated by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The firm used the Facebook trove, obtained without authorization, to build a software program to influence voters, including in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to the New York Times and Observer of London.","Multiple investigations have been opened in the United States and Europe as a result - just as Facebook scrambles to address earlier challenges involving fake-news and ad-measurement mishaps. The controversy hasn’t yet shaken the confidence of Madison Avenue, which is still shoveling money to Facebook. Revenue rose 47 percent last year to $41 billion.","The debacles may be taking a toll in other ways though. Zuckerberg said at his last quarterly earnings presentation that the aggregate time users spent on the social network was falling by 50 million hours every day. Advertisers often turn to how long people hang around as a sign of engagement.","And although the number of daily active users in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent year-over-year, to 1.4 billion globally, cracks are starting to appear in key markets. In the United States and Canada, members dipped by 1 million in the fourth quarter from the preceding three months, to 184 million, while in Europe member growth has slowed significantly. Those regions generated nearly 75 percent of the company’s fourth-quarter revenue.","Like MySpace before it, Facebook’s long-term dominance is by no means assured. New research from eMarketer estimates that Facebook’s share of the U.S. digital-ad market will slip slightly over the next two years as user growth slows and pricing for ads reaches its limits.

Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates.","A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information - including the names of users, their \"likes,\" friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work - including a former Cambridge Analytica employee - said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions.","Facebook is suspending the Trump -affiliated data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, after learning that it failed to delete data that it had taken inappropriately from users of the social network, Facebook said late Friday.","Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication...","The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates.","Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what \"like\" buttons they had hit.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning.","Despite Facebook's concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump's digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user-experience researcher, according to Facebook's public website.","Some critics said Facebook's actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump's campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Cambridge Analytica - which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president's former senior adviser Stephen Bannon - has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its \"psychometric profiles\" could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","The company's actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections.","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy, D, said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data \"may have been illegally acquired and used.\"","The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. \"It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\" Denham said in a statement.","Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 EU referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee which is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit group.","Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook's processes for dealing with developers who broke the company's rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules - usually because of a story in the news - the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said.","Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers.","Facebook \"relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,\" Parakilas said. \"During my 16 months at the company, I don't recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.\"","Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.","\"Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook's actions on Saturday, including if they ran afoul of their 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of their agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","In a statement, Facebook said \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry in to U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge's \"psychographic targeting\" techniques - including its use of Facebook data - with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of the Cambridge work.","The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers' likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time.","Cambridge's work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm's data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped.","Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign's data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump's strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.","SCL, Cambridge's parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in \"soft power,\" or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air.","Among its clients: NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russia's influence in the region.","SCL's main offering, first developed by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audience's values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of \"persuadables,\" and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting.","In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCL's defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the company's techniques is that it \"can be undertaken covertly.\"","\"Audience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and government's role and/or third parties can be invisible,\" he wrote."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

He pushed for as much to be revealed as possible, a wish opposed by the company's legal and policy teams, who were concerned about the effects those revelations would have on the business.","Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. Early on in his Facebook career, Stamos reportedly faced dismay from COO Sheryl Sandberg over how proactive the platform should be policing itself.","With his departure on the table, Stamos has reportedly handed over his duties countering government-sponsored misinformation, according to Reuters. His 120-person team is down to three, redistributed to product and infrastructure.","In a tweet, Stamos didn't deny that reports that he was leaving, but said he is \"still fully engaged\" with his work, and later denied claims Facebook executives discouraged the security team from investigating Russian interference.","Despite the rumors, I'm still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.","It's worth noting that according to the Times report, Stamos was encouraged by Facebook's communications team to tweet in defence of the company as news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke — but only after every word had been approved.","Stamos, whose original staff of 120 people has been whittled down to 3 people, is now having his tweets dictated to him by comms staff.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

When they met the following day, she led him down a hallway praising his performance. However, when she opened the door to a meeting room, he came face to face with members of Facebook’s secretive “rat-catching” team, led by the company’s head of investigations, Sonya Ahuja.","The interrogation was a technicality; they already knew he was guilty of leaking some innocuous information to the press. They had records of a screenshot he’d taken, links he had clicked or hovered over, and they strongly indicated they had accessed chats between him and the journalist, dating back to before he joined the company.","Contact the Guardian securely","Read more","“It’s horrifying how much they know,” he told the Guardian, on the condition of anonymity. “You go into Facebook and it has this warm, fuzzy feeling of ‘we’re changing the world’ and ‘we care about things’. But you get on their bad side and all of a sudden you are face to face with [Facebook CEO] Mark Zuckerberg’s secret police.”","The public image of Silicon Valley’s tech giants is all colourful bicycles, ping-pong tables, beanbags and free food, but behind the cartoonish facade is a ruthless code of secrecy. They rely on a combination of Kool-Aid, digital and physical surveillance, legal threats and restricted stock units to prevent and detect intellectual property theft and other criminal activity. However, those same tools are also used to catch employees and contractors who talk publicly, even if it’s about their working conditions, misconduct or cultural challenges within the company.","Zuckerberg hosts weekly meetings where he shares details of unreleased new products and strategies in front of thousands of employees. Even junior staff members and contractors can see what other teams are working on by looking at one of many of the groups on the company’s internal version of Facebook.","“When you first get to Facebook you are shocked at the level of transparency. You are trusted with a lot of stuff you don’t need access to,” said Evans, adding that during his induction he was warned not to look at ex-partners’ Facebook accounts.","“The counterbalance to giving you this huge trusting environment is if anyone steps out of line, they’ll squash you like a bug.”","The Google campus in Mountain View, California. The company has been sued for using overly broad confidentiality agreements and getting employees to spy on each other. Photograph: JasonDoiy/Getty Images","During one of Zuckerberg’s weekly meetings in 2015, after word of its new messaging assistant spread, the usually affable CEO warned employees: “We’re going to find the leaker, and we’re going to fire them.” A week later came the public shaming: Zuck revealed the culprit had been caught and fired. People at the meeting applauded.","“Companies routinely use business records in workplace investigations, and we are no exception,” said a Facebook spokeswoman, Bertie Thomson.","It’s a similar story at Google. Staff use an internal version of Google Plus and thousands of mailing lists to discuss everything from homeownership to items for sale, as well as social issues like neoconservatism and diversity. With the exception of James Damore’s explosive memo about gender and tech, most of it doesn’t leak.","By and large, staff buy into the corporate mission in a happy-clappy campus which helps foster a tribal mentality that discourages treachery. Employees are also rewarded with annual allocations of restricted stock that can buy silence for years after leaving.","“You would never do something that screws up the company’s chance of success because you are directly affected by it,” said a former Googler Justin Maxwell, who noted the pressure to behave in a “Googley” way.","The search engine’s former head of investigations, Brian Katz, highlighted this in 2016 in a company-wide email titled: “Internal only. Really.”","“If you’re considering sharing confidential information to a reporter – or to anyone externally – for the love of all that’s Googley, please reconsider! Not only could it cost you your job, but it also betrays the values that makes [sic] us a community,” he wrote.","This email came to light after another former employee sued Google for its overzealous approach to preventing leaks using overly broad confidentiality agreements and getting employees to spy on and report each other. The legal complaint alleges that Google’s policies violate labour laws that allow employees to discuss workplace conditions, wages and potential legal violations inside the company. Both parties are scheduled to enter mediation later this year.","James Damore, the software engineer who was fired from Google after writing a controversial memo questioning diversity programmes, suspects he was being monitored by the company during his final days.","He also described “weird things” happening to his work phone and laptop after the memo went viral. “All the internal apps updated at the same time, which had never happened before. I had to re-sign in to my Google account on both devices and my Google Drive – where the document was – stopped working.”","Damore said that much of the spying capabilities were outlined in his contract and that it was mostly “necessary” for a company that gives “everyone access to secret things”.","After he was fired, Damore stopped using his personal Gmail account in favour of Yahoo email out of fear that Google might be spying on him. “My lawyer doesn’t think they are above doing that,” he said.","However, a Google spokeswoman said the company never reads personal email accounts and denied spying on Damore’s devices.","“I wouldn’t expect them to admit to it,” Damore said.","Since Damore’s memo, Google has become much leakier, particularly around internal discussions of racial and gender diversity.","“It’s a cry for help internally,” said another former Googler, who now runs a startup.","He said people at Google had for years put up with covert sexism, internal biases or, in his case, a manager with anger management problems. “No one would do anything until one day a VP saw the guy yelling at me in the hallway.","“People have been dealing with this stuff for years and are finally thinking ‘if Google isn’t going to do something about it, we’re going to leak it’.”","Everyone was paranoid. When we texted each other, we’d use code if we needed to talk about work","For low-paid contractors who do the grunt work for big tech companies, the incentive to keep silent is more stick than carrot. What they lack in stock options and a sense of corporate tribalism, they make up for in fear of losing their jobs.","One European Facebook content moderator signed a contract, seen by the Guardian, which granted the company the right to monitor and record his social media activities, including his personal Facebook account, as well as emails, phone calls and internet use. He also agreed to random personal searches of his belongings including bags, briefcases and car while on company premises. Refusal to allow such searches would be treated as gross misconduct.","Following Guardian reporting into working conditions of community operations analysts at Facebook’s European headquarters in Dublin, the company clamped down further, he said.","Contractors would be questioned if they took photographs in the office or printed emails or documents. “On more than one occasion someone would print something and you’d find management going through the log to see what they had printed,” said one former worker.","Security teams would leave “mouse traps” – USB keys containing data that were left around the office to test staff loyalty. “If you find a USB or something you’d have to give it in straight away. If you plugged it into a computer it would throw up a flare and you’d be instantly escorted out of the building.”","“Everyone was paranoid. When we texted each other we’d use code if we needed to talk about work and meet up in person to talk about it in private,” he said.","Some employees switch their phones off or hide them out of fear that their location is being tracked. One current Facebook employee who recently spoke to Wired asked the reporter to turn off his phone so the company would have a harder time tracking if it had been near the phones of anyone from Facebook.","James Damore stopped using his personal Gmail account after being fired, due to fears Google was spying on him. Photograph: Winni Wintermeyer for the Guardian","Two security researchers confirmed that this would be technically simple for Facebook to do if both people had the Facebook app on their phone and location services switched on. Even if location services aren’t switched on, Facebook can infer someone’s location from wifi access points.","“We do not use cellphones to track employee locations, nor do we track locations of people who do not work at Facebook, including reporters,” said Thomson.","Companies will also hire external agencies to surveil their staff. One such firm, Pinkerton, counts Google and Facebook among its clients.","Among other services, Pinkerton offers to send investigators to coffee shops or restaurants near a company’s campus to eavesdrop on employees’ conversations.","Big data for the people: it's time to take it back from our tech overlords","Read more","“If we hear anything about a new product coming, or new business ventures or something to do with stocks, we’ll feed that information back to corporate security,” said David Davari, a managing director at the firm, adding that the focus is usually IP theft or insider trading.","Facebook and Google both deny using this service.","Through LinkedIn searches, the Guardian found several former Pinkerton investigators to have subsequently been hired by Facebook, Google and Apple.","“These tools are common, widespread, intrusive and legal,” said Al Gidari, consulting director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.","“Companies are required to take steps to detect and deter criminal misconduct, so it’s not surprising they are using the same tools to make sure employees are in compliance with their contractual obligations.”","This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The company just announced that it will end a feature called Partner Categories, launched back in 2013 out of a partnership between Facebook and major data brokers.","Third party data helps Facebook further atomize its user base into meaningful segments for advertisers. As TechCrunch explained when the data partnership first launched:","“Through new partnerships with top online and offline purchase data providers Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai, Facebook is now allowing advertisers to target hashed lists of existing and potential customers, and categories like role-playing gamers or soda drinkers.”","Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that the change is permanent, not a temporary precaution. In order to leverage the deep pool of data Facebook collects on users, the company mixes information that it obtains from users themselves (Pages a user liked, for instance) with information from advertisers (membership status in a loyalty program, for example) and with data obtained from third party providers.","While Facebook feels comfortable with the integrity of its data sourcing within the first two categories, it feels less settled about dipping into these aggregate pools of third party data.","The decision comes at the same time that Facebook is facing a lot of scrutiny and ire over third-party data mishandling. But it is also coming ahead of GDPR regulations and the ePrivacy Directive both coming into effect in Europe, which were already leading to the company making changes to its privacy policies, even before the Cambridge Analytica scandal even came to light.","Facebook Product Marketing Director Graham Mudd elaborated on the decision in a statement:","“We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories. This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.”","Facebook clarified that it will still work with companies like Experian and Acxiom in order to measure ad performance and provide metrics, although it will also be conducting a review of those ongoing relationships. Facebook may also move toward sharing data in a shared server environment in order to offer further assurances of user privacy. As Mudd noted, the program will be discontinued in the coming months."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Facebook user data has long been sold in Vietnam The information on sale includes names, telephone numbers, email addresses, home addresses, hobbies, and the interests of Facebook users. Pham Van Hoi, manager of a media company in Hanoi, said, “Facebook user data has long stopped being private.” A dozens of computer applications were created by developers to scan Facebook User ID (UID) to get related information. UID is similar to the identification number (ID) that Facebook gives to users and it is also the only way to identify a person. Through UID, scanning tools can access the data store for retrieving a person’s name, date of birth, gender, address, and even that person’s public friend list, then save it in an Excel file. A tool allowed to get the information of Facebook users Hoi also said that before June 2015 Facebook allowed ads to run directly with UID, which means that advertisers could target customers with greater accuracy. However, later the social network has stopped these kinds of ads, but they still indirectly run via phone or email (except the address of @facebook.com). Therefore, with some converters, Facebook users’ data can be used for marketing purposes. With monthly subscription fees going from hundreds to several millions of VND, the application can filter Facebook users’ private data for many different purposes.

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

However, he did support more regulations on transparency of political advertising.","Facebook's shares have taken a battering since the privacy scandal came to light last week. In full-page ads on several major US and UK Sunday papers, Zuckerberg apologized for the breach of trust.","\"We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't, we don't deserve it,\" the ad, signed by Zuckerberg, reads.","Apple's Cook didn't offer any ideas on what well-crafted regulations would look like, but said Apple was concerned that profiling of the type conducted by Cambridge Analytica would happen.","\"We've worried for a number of years that people in many countries were giving up data, probably without knowing fully what they were doing, and that these detailed profiles that were being built of them, that one day something would occur and people would be incredibly offended by what had been done without them being aware of it,\" Cook said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Instead, this final, tacked-on piece of legislation will erode privacy protections around the globe.","This bill is the CLOUD Act. It was never reviewed or marked up by any committee in either the House or the Senate. It never received a hearing. It was robbed of a stand-alone floor vote because Congressional leadership decided, behind closed doors, to attach this un-vetted, unrelated data bill to the $1.3 trillion government spending bill. Congress has a professional responsibility to listen to the American people’s concerns, to represent their constituents, and to debate the merits and concerns of this proposal amongst themselves, and this week, they failed.","On Thursday, the House approved the omnibus government spending bill, with the CLOUD Act attached, in a 256-167 vote. The Senate followed up late that night with a 65-32 vote in favor. All the bill requires now is the president’s signature.","Make no mistake—you spoke up. You emailed your representatives. You told them to protect privacy and to reject the CLOUD Act, including any efforts to attach it to must-pass spending bills. You did your part. It is Congressional leadership—negotiating behind closed doors—who failed.","Because of this failure, U.S. and foreign police will have new mechanisms to seize data across the globe. Because of this failure, your private emails, your online chats, your Facebook, Google, Flickr photos, your Snapchat videos, your private lives online, your moments shared digitally between only those you trust, will be open to foreign law enforcement without a warrant and with few restrictions on using and sharing your information. Because of this failure, U.S. laws will be bypassed on U.S. soil.","As we wrote before, the CLOUD Act is a far-reaching, privacy-upending piece of legislation that will:","Enable foreign police to collect and wiretap people's communications from U.S. companies, without obtaining a U.S. warrant.","Allow foreign nations to demand personal data stored in the United States, without prior review by a judge.","Allow the U.S. president to enter \"executive agreements\" that empower police in foreign nations that have weaker privacy laws than the United States to seize data in the United States while ignoring U.S. privacy laws.","Allow foreign police to collect someone's data without notifying them about it.","Empower U.S. police to grab any data, regardless if it's a U.S. person's or not, no matter where it is stored.","And, as we wrote before, this is how the CLOUD Act could work in practice:","London investigators want the private Slack messages of a Londoner they suspect of bank fraud. The London police could go directly to Slack, a U.S. company, to request and collect those messages. The London police would not necessarily need prior judicial review for this request. The London police would not be required to notify U.S. law enforcement about this request. The London police would not need a probable cause warrant for this collection.","Predictably, in this request, the London police might also collect Slack messages written by U.S. persons communicating with the Londoner suspected of bank fraud. Those messages could be read, stored, and potentially shared, all without the U.S. person knowing about it. Those messages, if shared with U.S. law enforcement, could be used to criminally charge the U.S. person in a U.S. court, even though a warrant was never issued.","This bill has large privacy implications both in the U.S. and abroad. It was never given the attention it deserved in Congress.","As Rep. McGovern said, the people deserve the right to a better process.","Related Updates","The Senate Commerce Committee is getting ready to host a much-anticipated hearing on consumer privacy—and consumer privacy groups don’t get a seat at the table.

Cambridge Analytica was looking for people who were American Facebook users. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz app on Facebook called thisisyourdigitallife.","About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app “scraped” information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends’ profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica.","A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn’t installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.","This weekend, after this was all exposed by The New York Times and The Observer of London, Facebook hastily made a public announcement that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica (well over a year after the election) and vehemently denied that this was a “data breach.” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false.” He contended that Facebook users “knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” He also said that “everyone involved gave their consent.”","Mr. Grewal is right: This wasn’t a breach in the technical sense. It is something even more troubling: an all-too-natural consequence of Facebook’s business model, which involves having people go to the site for social interaction, only to be quietly subjected to an enormous level of surveillance. The results of that surveillance are used to fuel a sophisticated and opaque system for narrowly targeting advertisements and other wares to Facebook’s users.","Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook’s true customers, whom it works hard to please.","Facebook doesn’t just record every click and “like” on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases “external” data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge “offline” data — things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store — with its vast online databases.","Facebook even creates “shadow profiles” of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data. This is an involuntary dossier from which you cannot opt out in the United States.","Despite Facebook’s claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her “consent” — at least not in any meaningful sense of the word. It is true that if you found and read all the fine print on the site, you might have noticed that in 2014, your Facebook friends had the right to turn over all your data through such apps. (Facebook has since turned off this feature.) If you had managed to make your way through a bewildering array of options, you might have even discovered how to turn the feature off.","This wasn’t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.","Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person’s personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook “likes” — and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day?","Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual — especially since it is practically irrevocable.","What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time.","The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company’s operations in the 2016 presidential election.","If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn’t have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn’t free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone’s data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance.","Should we all just leave Facebook? That may sound attractive but it is not a viable solution. In many countries, Facebook and its products simply are the internet. Some employers and landlords demand to see Facebook profiles, and there are increasingly vast swaths of public and civic life — from volunteer groups to political campaigns to marches and protests — that are accessible or organized only via Facebook.","The problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests?","A business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability.","Zeynep Tufekci (@zeynep) is an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, the author of “Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest” and a contributing opinion writer."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}
{"originalurl":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container","title":"Facebook Container – Add-ons for Firefox","text":["Extension Metadata","Used by","What does it do?Facebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.How does it work?Installing this extension deletes your Facebook cookies and logs you out of Facebook.The next time you navigate to Facebook it will load in a new blue colored browser tab (the “Container”). You can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container. Clicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.Which website features will not function?Because you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.","In addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.What does Facebook Container NOT protect against?It is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.","Rather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.What data does Mozilla receive from this extension?Mozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn moreOther ContainersFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site. Known IssuesWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.NOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.What version of Firefox do I need for this?This extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.","If you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)How does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?Facebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.","You can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.","Facebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers.

But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings. Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them.","Wednesday's announcement follows revelations that a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing. In addition, Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices.","Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for \"some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.\"","Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details.","The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people. For example, Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page.","Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls. Now, Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place. Facebook says it is also adding \"clearer explanations\" about how its privacy controls work.","Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, called the new settings \"the first of many steps\" the company is taking to address privacy concerns.","Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25. The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data. They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents, no matter where it is based.","To comply with this, Facebook is adding a section called \"access your information,\" a secure way for users to manage data they've shared with the company, including status updates, comments and things they have searched for. That's where people can go to delete information or download a copy. While this download was already possible, it took some time to figure out how to do it. Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail, without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past.","Cox said that while the changes are \"in line with the principle of GDPR,\" there's also a \"bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.\"","Facebook also said it will propose updates to its terms of service in the coming weeks and update its privacy policy, but gave no further details."],"isopubdate":""}

He became convinced the technology sector was careening toward its own crisis and decided to write about it.","The crisis has finally arrived, thanks to Cambridge Analytica, conveniently timed to coincide with the publication of Ferguson’s new book on the history of social networks, from the Freemasons to Facebook. “The Square and the Tower” is a cautionary tale that challenges the conventional wisdom that growing interconnectedness is inherently good for society. “Our networked world is fundamentally vulnerable, and two-factor authentication won’t save us,” Ferguson said at the Hoover Institution, where he is a senior fellow.","Since President Trump’s victory, much has been written about parallels between the present and the rise of authoritarian leaders in the 1930s. Ferguson thinks that’s lazy analysis. For most of the 20th century, communications systems were amenable to central control. This was a fluke of the Industrial Revolution, which produced telegraphs and then telephones. These technologies had an architecture that allowed whoever controlled the hub to dominate the spokes, which led to more hierarchical power structures.","To understand the current era, Ferguson believes we need to look more at what happened after Johannes Gutenberg developed the printing press. Like the Web, the use of these presses was difficult to centrally control. “At the beginning of the Reformation 501 years ago, Martin Luther thought naively that if everybody could read the Bible in the vernacular, they’d have a direct relationship with God, it would create ‘the priesthood of all believers’ and everything would be awesome,” Ferguson said.","“We’ve said the same things about the Internet,” he added. “We think that's obviously a good idea. Except it's not obviously a good idea, any more than it was in the 16th century. Because what the Europeans had was not ‘the priesthood of all believers.’ They had 130 years of escalating religious conflict, culminating in the Thirty Years War — one of the most destructive conflicts ever.”","The more he studies that period, the more echoes Ferguson sees in the 21st century. “What one can see in the 16th and 17th centuries is polarization, fake news-type stories, the world getting smaller and therefore contagion is capable of spreading much faster,” Ferguson said. “These big shifts in network structure led to revolutions against hierarchical institutions.”","Ferguson points to recent studies showing that fake news can spread faster and farther than real news when it’s especially sensational. “The crazy stuff is more likely to go viral because we're kind of interested in crazy stuff, but this is not surprising historically,” he said. “The idea that witches live amongst us and should be burned went as viral as anything that Martin Luther said ... Indeed, it turned out that witch burning was more likely to happen in places where there were more printing presses.”","In a sobering 90-minute conversation, the author said he’s driven to sleeplessness when he thinks about how some of the dynamics on social media will play out in the future. “I'm much more worried than a non-historian by what I see because history tells me that the polarization process keeps going, and it doesn't just stop at verbal violence because at a certain point that's not satisfying,” Ferguson said.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg meets with a group of entrepreneurs in St. Louis last November. (Jeff Roberson/AP)","Enter Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is worth around $64 billion as a 33-year-old because of his brilliance at creating an addictive social network that capitalized on the human desire for connection. The site was already embattled for allowing the Kremlin to use its platform to sow domestic discord. The Russians were literally buying political ads to target American voters with rubles. Now Zuckerberg is under growing scrutiny for the firm’s failure to safeguard data in the wake of damning whistleblower revelations about Cambridge Analytica, a voter profiling firm which harvested the personal information of as many as 50 million users and earned $6 million from President Trump’s 2016 campaign.","The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook broke the law or violated a 2011 settlement agreement. A bipartisan chorus in Congress is demanding that Zuckerberg testify under oath. His lobbyists are negotiating the details of an appearance. Recognizing the political risk, Facebook executives have even begun saying publicly that they’re receptive to being more heavily regulated.","“I don’t think they have thought deeply at all about the historical significance of their predicament, and I blame Mark Zuckerberg for dropping out of Harvard before he took any of my classes,” Ferguson quipped. “If he had taken my course in western civilization, he'd know that he's become a strange amalgam of John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst all at once. When you look back on the experience of these figures, what's the common characteristic? They went through a phase of deep unpopularity.”","Ferguson, who like Carnegie is a native of Scotland, believes that the American government must move aggressively to rein in the power of companies like Facebook. “If we don't act, the next phase of the process will be even uglier than the current Cambridge Analytica phase — which is the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “Think of how many other people have downloaded the data. The window was open for years.”","He believes Facebook should be treated under the law more like a content publisher than a technology company. Amending the Telecommunications Act of 1996 could increase their liability and make them more accountable for damaging information trafficked on their platforms. “It is an untenable state of affairs that a few private companies know more about the citizens of a country than the citizens themselves, much less the government,” said Ferguson. “And it is untenable that the companies concerned are … so easily instrumentalized by hostile foreign governments that as many people saw Russian-originated content in 2016 as voted in the presidential election. Regardless of where you are on the political spectrum, you cannot possibly think this is okay.”","Despite all the attention paid to the ongoing Russia probes, Ferguson thinks media coverage of the midterms needs to emphasize how vulnerable the Internet remains to manipulation by the forces of darkness. “It's as if people who work professionally in politics just want to pretend that it's still pre-2008, whereas the entire system of politics has completely changed,” he said. “Facebook advertising is the most powerful tool in politics. I don't think we're doing nearly enough to avoid another legitimacy crisis around this.”","-- Kim Jong Un did meet with the Chinese president in Beijing, Chinese and North Korea state media confirmed. The “unofficial visit” is believed to be Kim's first trip abroad since coming to power in 2011. Emily Rauhala reports: “In Washington, [Sarah Huckabee Sanders] said that the Chinese government had briefed the Trump administration about the visit …The Trump administration sees the development ‘as further evidence that our campaign of maximum pressure is creating the appropriate atmosphere for dialogue … ’ [Sanders added]. Kim is expected to meet [South Korean President Moon Jae-in] next month, and is in discussions about talks with Trump … \"","-- Trump tweeted about his planned meeting with Kim this morning:","For years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting!","Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me. In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!","-- White House officials said they reached an agreement in principle with Seoul to overhaul the Korea-U.S. trade deal known as KORUS. David J. Lynch writes: “South Korea agreed to limit its steel exports to the United States, a key U.S. goal, and take several steps to open its auto market to American companies. In return, Trump agreed to exempt South Korea from his new 25 percent tariff on imported steel. But threatening negotiating partners with tariffs unless they make concessions, as the United States did with South Korea, is not President Trump’s innovation. It is a tactic that Washington often used before the creation of the World Trade Organization, though one that did little to reduce the bilateral trade deficits that preoccupy the president. It also may prove a riskier strategy when U.S. negotiators take on more-powerful countries, including China … ”","-- Stormy Daniel’s attorney is seeking to depose Trump about his knowledge of an alleged $130,000 payout to the adult-film star. Derek Hawkins reports: “In documents filed early Wednesday morning, Michael Avenatti said he was seeking to depose Trump and [his lawyer Michael] Cohen for no more than two hours each to find out whether Trump was aware of the agreement and whether he consented to it. Avenatti requested the court hold a hearing on the matter on April 30. The chances of speedy action by a judge on a request of such constitutional magnitude are slim.”","GET SMART FAST:​​","Louisiana authorities said the two police officers involved in the fatal 2016 shooting of Alton Sterling will not face criminal charges.

(Jose Luis Magana/AP)","PERSONNEL IS POLICY:","-- For weeks, Trump has told advisers he wants to oust David Shulkin, subjecting the VA secretary to “presidential purgatory.”Lisa Rein, Josh Dawsey and Emily Wax-Thibodeaux report: “The uncertainty has left the leader of the federal government’s second-largest agency, its employees and even senior White House officials wondering if Shulkin still officially speaks for VA. It has raised questions, too, about what’s being done to restore order at the agency after weeks of turmoil have left little doubt that Shulkin … is next to go in what’s become a pronounced leadership shake-up. What’s befallen Shulkin is a favorite tactic of Trump’s, who followed a similar approach with [Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster] … The president emasculates those who fall from favor, humiliating them through media leaks and in disparaging comments to friends. The mixed signals often leave even senior White House officials guessing who will be fired and when.”","-- The State Department is bracing for the return of incoming national security adviser John Bolton, with diplomats rehashing stories about the former U.N. adviser’s aggressive management style and prolific broadsides against the Foreign Service. John Hudson reports: “In his new job, Bolton will not directly oversee the State Department, but his powerful perch [will] offer opportunities to shape and influence policy and personnel at Foggy Bottom. Bolton’s advisers and former colleagues say he has a good relationship with [secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo]. But they said Bolton is unlikely to take a back seat to the former Kansas congressman on the issues he cares about most: Iran and North Korea … How Bolton will fit into a combustible Cabinet ecosystem of strong personalities … is unclear, but contemporaries of Bolton said he should not be underestimated.Individuals close to Bolton said they [expect] him to ‘clear house’ at the NSC and remove staffers viewed as allies of H.R. McMaster or the previous administration.” “His style will be to run an imperial NSC where the State and Defense departments are there to implement White House policy,” said longtime Bolton adviser Mark Groombridge.","-- Bolton laid out an aggressive response to Russia’s election interference in a speech made weeks before Trump selected him as national security adviser. Josh Rogin writes: “The Trump administration has not done enough to respond to Russia’s attack on the United States and our democratic institutions, Bolton said [last month at the Daniel Morgan Graduate School of National Security], and Putin must pay a heavy price for his actions. … The United States should respond in ‘cyberspace and elsewhere,’ Bolton said, suggesting offensive action against the Russian operatives that perpetrated the interference. Only if the response is overwhelming will Russia and other countries be deterred. … But Bolton doesn’t want Trump to stop there. As he explained during his extensive remarks, the United States should also push back on a range of Kremlin transgressions: its support for Syria, its alliance with Iran, its undermining of North Korea sanctions, and its coordination with China to thwart the West.”","-- White House budget director Mick Mulvaney is poised to get greater control over Treasury Department regulations. Politico’s Nancy Cook and Aaron Lorenzo report: “The move, which could come in the next few weeks, would end the autonomy the Treasury Department has enjoyed since the 1980s when it comes to issuing tax rules, while giving greater power to one of Trump’s favorite Cabinet members at the expense of another. The highly sensitive debate has consumed the attention of top officials at both agencies.

Sunshine played Tinka Hessenheffer in “Shake It Up,” a Disney show that ran from 2010 to 2013, and previously interned at the White House. (CNN)","THE IMMIGRATION AGENDA:","-- Trump is privately pushing the U.S. military to foot the bill on construction of a border wall. Josh Dawsey and Mike DeBonis report: “Trump has told advisers that he was spurned in a large spending bill last week when lawmakers appropriated only $1.6 billion for the border wall. He has suggested to [Defense Secretary Jim Mattis] and congressional leaders that the Pentagon could fund the sprawling project, citing a ‘national security’ risk. After floating the notion to several advisers last week, Trump told [Paul Ryan] that the military should pay for the wall[.] Ryan offered little reaction to the idea … but senior Capitol Hill officials later said it was an unlikely prospect. In another interaction with senior aides last week, Trump noted that the Defense Department was getting so much money as part of the spending bill that the Pentagon could surely afford the border wall … The Pentagon has plenty of money, but reprogramming it for a wall would require votes in Congress that the president does not seem to have. Taking money from the 2018 budget for the wall would require an act of Congress[.]”","Sarah Huckabee Sanders deflected a question about using dedicated military funds for the wall: “I can’t get into the specifics of that at this point, but I can tell you that the continuation of building the wall is ongoing, and we’re going to continue moving forward in that process,” she told reporters.","-- The administration’s decision to add a census question on citizenship has sparked political and legal backlash, mostly recently from New York, which promised a “multistate” lawsuit challenging the policy. From Seung Min Kim and Tara Bahrampour: “[T]here is little [Democratic lawmakers] can do to immediately counter the move. The massive spending bill lawmakers passed last week would have been the best chance the minority party had this year to try to block the Census Bureau from moving forward with its plan, with congressional Republicans so far showing little appetite to protest the decision. The confrontation becomes another key factor hanging in the balance in the upcoming midterm elections, with Democrats gaining considerable leverage to scrap the census decision should they win control of either chamber.”","-- CNN’s Harry Enten crunched the numbers to find out how blue states would be affected by the citizenship question: “According to the 2016 American Community Survey, there are 13 million non-citizens living in states (and Washington DC) won by Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. There are only about 9.5 million non-citizens living in states won by Republican Donald Trump. In other words, about 58% of non-citizens live in Clinton states and 42% live in Trump states. These percentages, however, undersell the political impact to blue states. The vast majority of the states to be impacted are blue states. Clinton-won states make up 76% of the states where there are more non-citizens than the average state to Trump's 24%. …","“California and blue states in general could definitely lose seats in Congress too if non-citizens (here legally or illegally) are afraid to answer the Census. Let's say every non-citizen were afraid to answer Census. That's unlikely to happen, but it gives you a good idea of the stakes. … The 2016 American Community Survey suggests California could lose up to four seats in Congress in such a scenario. No other state would lose more than one.”","-- Trump terminated deportation protections for 4,000 Liberians, who first received temporary protected status 27 years ago. From USA Today’s Alan Gomez: “Liberians were first granted TPS in March 1991 under former President George H.W. Bush due to armed conflicts that were gripping the country. Starting in 1999, Liberians were transferred into a separate program called Deferred Enforced Departure, a classification that allowed them to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation. That status was approved several times by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama as the country grappled with a civil war, ongoing armed conflicts, and an outbreak of the Ebola virus. But on Tuesday, after consulting with the departments of State and Homeland Security, Trump concluded that those conditions had been largely resolved. Liberians will have 12 months to get their affairs in order and return to their home country.”","-- The Orange County Sheriff’s Department is moving to sidestep California State Bill 54, which restricts communication between federal immigration authorities and local law enforcement. Alex Horton reports: “[The sheriff’s office said] it would put the date an inmate will be released on its website. ‘This action will enhance communication between the Sheriff’s Department and our law enforcement partners to remove dangerous offenders from our community,’ the department said in a statement … But critics say the measure will cast too wide a net and hand ICE information on the whereabouts of undocumented immigrants who may never be charged with a crime.”","Christopher Steele. (Victoria Jones/AP)","THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:","-- An employee of Palantir Technologies, owned by Peter Thiel, helped Cambridge Analytica to develop its data-gathering practices. The New York Times’s Nicholas Confessore and Matthew Rosenberg report: “It was a Palantir employee in London, working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge’s psychological profiling technology, who suggested the scientists create their own app — a mobile-phone-based personality quiz — to gain access to Facebook users’ friend networks, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. Cambridge ultimately took a similar approach. By early summer, the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app.”","-- Christopher Steele, the former MI6 officer who wrote the Trump dossier, provided the FBI with another secret report that claimed Vladimir Putin’s former media czar was beaten to death at a D.C. hotel in 2015. This directly contradicts the U.S. government’s official finding that Mikhail Lesin died by “accident.” BuzzFeed News reports Lesin died “on the eve of a scheduled meeting with US Justice Department officials. They had planned to interview Lesin about the inner workings of RT, the Kremlin-funded network that he founded. … The Steele report is not the FBI's only source for this account of Lesin's death: Three other people, acting independently … said they also told the FBI that Lesin had been bludgeoned to death by enforcers working for the same oligarch named by Steele.”","-- The dearth of top talent on Trump’s legal team has led to the promotion of a little-known former prosecutor, Reuters’s Karen Freifeld reports. “Andrew Ekonomou, 69, is one of a handful of lawyers assisting Jay Sekulow, the main attorney representing Trump in [Mueller’s] investigation. .... Sekulow said Ekonomou, who works under contract as an assistant district attorney in Brunswick, Georgia, was a ‘brilliant strategist’ who has handled complex investigations for decades. Ekonomou assisted Sekulow in a famous case involving the religious group Jews for Jesus before the Supreme Court in the 1980s. While Ekonomou has also worked on criminal matters, he has not handled cases as high-profile and complex as the Mueller probe.”","-- A bipartisan pair of senators who wrote a bill meant to protect Mueller’s investigation issued a statement urging Trump not to interfere with the special counsel. Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) said: “This should not be a partisan issue. … We urge President Trump to allow the Special Counsel to complete his work without impediment, which is in the best interest of the American people, the President, and our nation.” (Politico)","-- Robert Mueller’s team claimed in a court filing it has connected Rick Gates to a person with Russian intelligence ties. CNN’s Katelyn Polantz reports: “That Gates and the unnamed person, who had lived in Kiev and Moscow and worked for one of Paul Manafort's companies, were in touch in September and October 2016 was ‘pertinent to the investigation,’ [the court filing said]. The acknowledgment that Gates knew the person had Russian intelligence ties is alleged in a report prosecutors filed about the coming sentencing of [Dutch attorney Alex van der Zwaan]. … [Van der Zwaan] pleaded guilty last month to lying to [Mueller's] investigators about his interactions with Gates and the unnamed person.”","-- Paul Manafort is asking for 18 criminal charges against him in Virginia to be thrown out. From Spencer S. Hsu: “Manafort’s attorneys in January and again in a longer, 38-page filing Tuesday argued that acting attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein improperly ordered Mueller to investigate ‘links and/or coordination’ between the Russian government and Trump campaign, as well as ‘any matters that arose or may arise directly from’ that investigation.”","-- British Prime Minister Theresa May urged her country’s allies to adopt a “long-term response” to deal with Russia’s ongoing security threat — speaking just one day after 26 countries announced plans to expel Russian diplomats in retaliation for the poisoning of a former spy. (Reuters)","FLORIDA FALLOUT:","-- Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a New York Times op-ed arguing for the repeal of the Second Amendment: “Concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states led to the adoption of that amendment, which provides that ‘a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.’ Today that concern is a relic of the 18th century. For over 200 years after the adoption of the Second Amendment, it was uniformly understood as not placing any limit on either federal or state authority to enact gun control legislation.”","-- “[R]arely do we see such an unhelpful, untimely and fanciful idea as the one put forward by [Stevens],” Aaron Blake writes. “The move might as well be considered an in-kind contribution to the National Rifle Association, to Republicans' efforts to keep the House and Senate in 2018, and to President Trump's 2020 reelection bid. In one fell swoop, Stevens has lent credence to the talking point that the left really just wants to get rid of gun ownership and reasserted the need for gun-rights supporters to prevent his ilk from ever being appointed again (with the most obvious answer being: Vote Republican).”","-- Polling shows only 1 in 5 Americans would support such an appeal, Christopher Ingraham notes. “In February, for instance, the Economist and YouGov asked Americans whether they supported a repeal of the Second Amendment. Twenty-one percent said they favored such a proposal, compared with 60 percent in opposition. The poll does, however, show surprisingly robust support for Second Amendment repeal (39 percent) among Democrats (by contrast, 8 percent of Republicans would support a full repeal).”","-- The far-right Internet has circulated memes comparing the Parkland, Fla., survivors to Nazis. From Eli Rosenberg: “Alex Jones, the conservative host of Infowars known for spreading baseless conspiracy theories, depicted two of the most prominent students, Emma González and David Hogg, in a jarring video that spliced images and videos of them into what appeared to be Nazi footage. … Jones’s staff also played a Hitler speech over video of Hogg speaking at the march. Jones said the images were meant to communicate the ‘truly frightening historical iconography that you cannot deny in these parallels of this youth march.’”","-- Margaret Sullivan writes the growing acceptance of such conspiracy theories on the more traditional right underscores the “spreading stain” of extreme partisanship: “What we’re seeing here is a spreading stain, in which conspiracy mongering from the likes of Infowars and, yes, Gateway Pundit is adopted by some elements of the formerly mainstream right and peddled to a receptive audience softened up for decades by Fox News. … There seems to be no floor of indecency that we agree to stay above. As Charlie Warzel, who covers ‘information wars’ for BuzzFeed News, put it recently: Extreme partisanship — pro-Trump media as well as parts of the far left — ‘is not about intellectual courage. It’s about winning.’”","THE MIDTERMS:","-- Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.), who had already ruled out running for Congress again, announced he would remove his name from the GOP primary ballot. Dave Weigel explains: “Had Costello remained on the ballot, he would have faced Greg McCauley, a tax attorney and first-time candidate who began running for a different district in February and jumped into the 6th after the new maps were drawn.”","-- The Cook Political Report views McCauley as too conservative for the district and gives the edge to Democrats to pick up the seat. Amber Phillips notes: “Democrats have two near-certain pickups in Pennsylvania. (The first being Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a special election this month in a district that Trump won by 20 points; Lamb is likely to win in the district in November because of the redrawn lines.) … Put another way: We're entering an election cycle in which every pickup for Democrats matters, and Republican retirements are set to be a major factor in their ability to knock off Republicans.”","-- Mitt Romney pointed to his stance on “dreamers” as an example of how he is more conservative than Trump on certain issues. The Daily Herald’s Katie England reports: “Romney went so far as to say he’s more conservative on certain issues than President Trump. ‘For instance, I’m a deficit hawk ... That makes me more conservative than a lot of Republicans and a lot of Democrats. I’m also more of a hawk on immigration than even the president. My view was these DACA kids shouldn’t all be allowed to stay in the country legally.’”","-- Congressional Republicans are angling for another round of tax cut votes with an eye on the midterms. Politico’s Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade report: “GOP leaders are weighing a series of votes to make last year’s temporary tax cuts for individuals permanent, according to Republicans in both chambers. The strategy would portray the party as the guardian of Americans’ paychecks, Republicans say, and buoy the GOP during a brutal election year. Republicans argue they win regardless of whether it culminates with a Rose Garden ceremony: Either Democrats support the legislation, giving the GOP a major legislative accomplishment in its scramble to save its majorities. Or, more likely, Democrats block the bill — allowing Republicans to paint them as opponents of the middle class.”","-- Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) were in regular contact for days before the “spontaneous” announcement that Florida had been exempted from the administration’s offshore drilling expansion. Politico’s Matt Dixon reports: “[Obtained] documents … contradict the supposed spontaneous event that portrayed Scott as single-handedly securing a politically popular win for Florida’s environmental future only days after the administration had spelled out a controversial new national five-year plan to boost offshore oil drilling. … The records reaffirm the perception at the time that the Trump administration’s decision to reverse course and remove Florida from the list was carefully choreographed to give Scott a political win in his widely expected challenge this year to unseat [Sen.

Now. - The Washington Post","text":["Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg need to come clean about 2016. Now.","Over the weekend, the New York Times and the Observer of London posted a blockbuster investigative piece revealing that Cambridge Analytica, the firm brought on by the Trump campaign to target voters online, used the data of tens of millions of people obtained from Facebook without proper disclosures or permission.","In the wake of this report, it’s more than past time for Mark Zuckerberg to testify to Congress about Facebook’s role in the 2016 elections and why he believes existing privacy laws are adequate to protect Americans from misuse and abuse of technology platforms.","And I mean Mark Zuckerberg. Not a Facebook lawyer, like the one the company sent to Congress last year for hearings on how fake news swamped tech platforms such as, oh, Facebook. As Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) tweeted:","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The investigation published by the Times revealed that Cambridge Analytica, after receiving $15 million from conservative donor Robert Mercer in 2014 to micro-target voters, obtained the information to do so in a questionable way. A British professor collected the information from Facebook, saying he was conducting an academic personality study. He did get the approval of about 270,000 people who signed up to take part in the study — they were told their information would be used. He did not, however, get the permission of the users’ friends, whose information was also gathered — an estimated 50 million people.","It’s not just that such an action is unethical. It might well be a violation of an agreement Facebook made with the federal government. Two former employees of the Federal Trade Commission have now told The Post that it’s quite possible that Facebook violated a 2011 agreement with the agency to notify and offer users an out when there is an effort to use their personal information in a way not in line with their privacy settings. This agreement was reached after consumer groups complained that Facebook was cavalier with personal information.","So back to Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook found out, courtesy of a 2015 piece in the Guardian, that Cambridge Analytica and British academics had information on many users that agreed to such a collection, it demanded the information be destroyed. This did not happen. Facebook cited this when pressed on the latest revelations by the Times, claiming that the companies that misused the data “certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","(On Monday afternoon, Facebook announced that Cambridge Analytica agreed to a digital audit to prove it destroyed the disputed materials. The professors involved in using the data also agreed to an audit.)","And so, after the Times published its piece, Facebook didn’t own up to what happened. Instead, Facebook executives have gotten into a multiplespats with reporters and others over whether the Cambridge Analytica incident is a “breach” or a mere misuse of personal information, since some (but not all!) the people whose data was involved did give permission for their data to be taken and the company was not actually hacked. Facebook’s motive for this is almost certainly legal and regulatory. As Bloomberg News notes, a “breach” is a specific term that requires the company to notify users their information was illegally accessed.","But there is quite possibly a bigger motive. Painting Cambridge Analytica as the villain is an attempt to get Facebook off the hook for its ongoing role in everything from other invasions of privacy (more about that in a moment) to the ongoing complaints about its role in spreading fake news in the 2016 elections. If one or two rogue companies such as Cambridge Aanlytica — and not Facebook — are responsible for this mass misuse of data, perhaps the company can say more regulation is not needed.","But don’t fall for the idea that Facebook is not the problem. This is hardly a first-time offense for Facebook, which — a reminder — allowed fake news to flood many users’ news feeds in the months leading up to the 2016 elections.","In fact, Washington perhaps should have gotten interested in Facebook well before the Trump election contretemps. Over time, Facebook has indulged in numerous instances of dodgy behavior. There was the time Facebook altered news feeds to study whether they could affect the mood of people on the platform. There was the reveal that its platform permitted ad buyers to target people with such delightful terms as “jew hater.” And the discovery that Facebook made it possible to target housing ads to whites only.","Whether this latest scandal was a breach or a misuse of information is irrelevant. It was wrong. Zuckerberg needs to explain — slowly and clearly and without legal terminology or whiny excuses — what went wrong at the company he founded in his Harvard dorm room, and what steps the company is taking to make sure it never happens again. My suspicion? He can’t do that. Instead, a Zuckerberg appearance will demonstrate the need for significant federal regulation of large technology platforms.

Let’s pry off the lid and peer into the inner-workings of this “Data Machine.”","The Signal in the Noise","Building on the data analysis by @Conspirator0 on Twitter, Tea Pain has stumbled onto a possible “signal in the noise” that opens a window into the data-swappin’ shenanigans going on between Trump Tower, Spectrum Health and Russia’s Alfa Bank during the election.","Spectrum Health, owned by Michigan’s powerful Devos family, attempted to explain the IP activity as “Voice over IP traffic”, whereas Alfa Bank offered an even more exotic explanation that “hackers attempted to make it look like we contacted Trump Tower.”","The data traffic, when analyzed, tells a very different story, a story of automated, orchestrated data sharing among multiple sites for a strategic end.","Tea Pain originally dismissed this story as a possible red-herring. With the Russia craze at a fever pitch, this activity could be explained by what Tea’s daddy used to say, “When you got a new hammer, everything looks like a nail.” But when Tea Pain saw the data patterns analyzed by Conspiritor0, he knew he’d spotted something mighty familiar: Database Replication. Put a pin in that, more on that later.","At first, data analysts were puzzled by what appeared to be random activity with no apparent pattern. Perhaps it was email activity? Maybe money transfers? But there were literally thousands of these IP “pings.”","Once the activity was charted, a pattern emerged. For example, a connection is made from Alfa Bank to Trump Tower, which may last anywhere from 1 minute to 15 minutes or more, followed by a longer “sleep” period. When averaged over months, these events charted an average time between connections to be 3660 seconds, or 1 hour and 1 minute. Whatever was running, it would hook up, transfer data for a few minutes, then go to sleep for an hour.","This was the clue that led Tea Pain to formulate a much clearer working model to explain what we were all seeing: SQL Server Database Replication between multiple sites.","What Is Database Replication?","Database Replication is a rather simple concept. When you have a database with millions of records representing hundreds of gigabytes of data, and you would like to keep a copy of that database housed in 2 or more locations, it makes no sense to continually copy the entire database from point A to point B every time a change is made, so you “replicate” it.","This allows only the changes made to be sent from one database to another. This is accomplished by a process that runs on timely intervals, usually an hour, that wakes up and checks the changes made since the last hour and broadcasts those changes to the other database. The other database, in turn, check for its changes and broadcasts them in the other direction. Voila! Both databases are identical!","So what does the data traffic patterns suggest? Check out the chart below. Behold, Kushner’s “Stealth Data Machine.”","The white box illustrates the scope of data we can now observe. The bulk of the replication took place between Trump Tower and Alfa Bank, while smaller amounts of data were transferred between Trump Tower and Spectrum Health. If, for example, Trump Tower talked to Alfa Bank for 10 minutes, the next Spectrum-Trump Tower connection might last only one minute, indicating data replicated from Trump Tower to the Devos health care empire was being filtered, perhaps by “WHERE StateCode=’MI'” for example. But when changes were made at Spectrum, things looked very different.","Conspiritor0 noted that when Spectrum connected to Trump Tower, Trump Tower’s next connect time was significantly longer, indicating Spectrum had modified a large chunk of records that had to be synced to Trump Tower, then pushed on to Alfa Bank. This detail was important in identifying that replication was in use. In this scenario, Trump Tower was functioning as a center-point, a data distribution center if you will.","We don’t know what was in these data packets; that info is beyond our purview at this time, but ask yourself a simple question and you find your answer: “What do Trump Tower, the Devos Family and the Russians all have in common? A desire for Donald Trump to be President of the United States.","Tea Pain’s working theory is that Russia created a voter targeting database with information gleaned from hacked DNC data rolls and other data rolls “acquired” from other states to feed this growing contact database. That database originated at Russian Intelligence which was in turn replicated to Russia’s Alfa Bank. This is where the “data laundering” takes place, Alfa Bank is the pivot point where the FSB’s data fingerprints are wiped clean. Ironically Russia launders its data at the same place it launders its money.","At Trump Tower, more data could merged into this system using various legal sources as well. Spectrum Health could also add value to the data by matching names and addresses in their extensive healthcare databases to harvest email addresses and phone numbers to flesh out this list. All these changes would be promptly replicated back to Russia in a matter of hours.","Once back in the hands of Russian Intelligence, this massaged data could be programmatically matched up with social media handles to create a micro-targeted “hit list” for the thousand Russian trolls employed by Putin.","The Payoff","How is this a breakthrough? Now that we have identified the likely means of how this data was transferred, data analysts now have more precise points to search for to arrive at a complete reveal of the massive data collusion between Team Trump and America’s foremost adversary.","The “beauty” of this system is its simplicity. Here’s some bullet-points to sum up.","No special software needed. SQL Server is used in most every major enterprise. Replication is a built-in tool. No mysterious hidden processes, viruses, malware, etc.","Virtually undetectable. No one would blink an eye at data replication, a standard business practice.","Could all be set up remotely with only VPN credentials and remote desktop access, information that is often shared via routine third-party data audits. No one inside Trump Tower or Spectrum’s IT department need be involved. One Russian Intelligence data operative could set this up in less than an hour at each location. No low-level “conspirators” needed.","Value could be added to the data anywhere in the chain and it would promote back to Russian Intelligence within 2-3 hours.","All data-transmission would be out in the open, mixed in with the daily flow of business.","Even if found, the data would look benign, just names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social media handles, etc. No financial information. It would look just like a contact lead database purchased from any data-mining merchant.","Trump/Spectrum operatives and employees in the United States could interact with this list and have no clue the origins of the data were nefarious. This plain-sight approach was the key to its success."],"isopubdate":"2017-04-03"}

The worse news is that people are learning how to detonate it.”","The controversy began late Friday when Facebook’s vice-president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, announced in a blog post that the social network was suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories and its affiliate, Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook said the companies failed to delete user data they had acquired in 2015 in violation of the platform’s rules. The data was supplied by a University of Cambridge psychology professor, Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was supposed to collect details on Facebook users for academic research. Kogan was not supposed to pass that information to a third party for commercial purposes under Facebook guidelines.","Facebook said the data collection was contained to 270,000 people who downloaded Kogan’s app as well as “limited information” about their friends.","But a whistleblower and other reported sources contend the scope of the data collection was significantly larger. Christopher Wylie, a departed co-founder of Cambridge Analytica, said Kogan harvested data from 50 million Facebook users without their permission, largely by mining friends of the people who downloaded his app.","The allegations were first reported by the New York Times and the British newspaper the Observer, whose stories about the breach were pre-empted hours earlier by Facebook’s announcement of the suspensions.","Wylie, who described Cambridge Analytica as a weapon designed to wage a culture war in the U.S., said Facebook wasn’t particularly adamant about censuring his former company. He said the only effort made by the social network was sending a letter in August 2016 demanding that the data Kogan supplied be destroyed. He said Facebook never verified whether the data had been deleted.","Facebook, which also suspended Wylie, did not respond to a request for comment.","Christopher Wylie, who helped found the data firm Cambridge Analytica and worked there until 2014, said, \"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\" (ANDREW TESTA/NYT)","As recently as last month, Cambridge Analytica told a British parliamentary hearing that it never had or used Facebook data. But in a statement Saturday, Cambridge Analytica admitted receiving user information from Kogan and then deleting it after learning it violated Facebook’s rules. The firm added it never used any of the data for Trump’s 2016 campaign when it was hired as a consultant.","According to a story in the Guardian, the British newspaper, Kogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","Cambridge Analytica reportedly needed Facebook’s data for its so-called psychographic profiling, which combines data collected online to glean a better understanding of voters’ personalities in order to tailor ads to them.","In many ways, it’s not unlike what Facebook can do for advertisers and a growing number of political campaigns willing to pay and play by Facebook’s rules. By micro-targeting users down to what charities they donate to, what device they play video games on and where they stand on the political spectrum, Facebook says its reach is expertly tailored to its clients’ needs.","That kind of granular data helped increase Facebook’s advertising revenue last year by 49 per cent. Advertising accounted for more than 98 per cent of Facebook’s total revenue in 2017, according to company filings.","None of that would be possible without hundreds of millions of users willingly sharing enough details about themselves to be categorized by advertisers.","That business model is now under threat within the European Union, where the General Data Protection Regulation set to be introduced in May will prohibit companies like Facebook from leveraging user information on subjects such as race and politics without consent.","Facebook is adamant that the Cambridge Analytica controversy does not amount to a security breach. An admission would further sour the company’s reputation in Europe for lax privacy standards. There’s also a risk of running afoul of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.","“Platforms like Facebook need to be very, very careful with data, and they will come under more scrutiny by the government going forward,” said Rich Raddon, co-founder of Zefr, a Los Angeles startup that helps brands target YouTube content for advertising. “In Europe we are seeing a reaction to these platforms leveraging personal identifiable information.”","Raddon said by virtue of its size, Facebook will be heavily scrutinized by lawmakers for how it analyzes personal data. But smaller firms like Cambridge Analytica can fly under the radar doing virtually the same thing.","Facebook says it has beefed up its review of third-party apps like Kogan’s, which tap into the social network’s fire hose of data. That includes requiring developers to first “justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it,” said Grewal, the Facebook attorney.","“Facebook’s business model is actually focused on not giving third parties data about its users,” said Aviv Ovadya, chief technologist at the Center for Social Media Responsibility. “If it owns the data, and you can only target people through its platform, then you must spend money on its platform. Facebook also wants people to be as comfortable as possible giving them data, so they want to ensure that the data is protected from being used in problematic ways.”","Facebook’s critics now say devoting attention to those who exploit the platform, such as Russian trolls, is short-sighted. More attention should be directed at the social network itself, which provides the tools for exploitation, they say. Kogan, for instance, didn’t break any rules when he accessed information from millions of users without their consent. He only broke the rules when he shared that information for commercial gain.","“The data that Facebook leaked to Cambridge Analytica is the same data Facebook retains on everyone and sells targeting services around. The problem is not shady Russian researchers; it’s Facebook’s core business model of collect, store, analyze, exploit,” Maciej Ceglowski, a prominent San Francisco web developer and leader of grassroots activist group Tech Solidarity, wrote in a tweet Saturday.","More from The Star & Partners","LOADING","Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

While Facebook is not unfamiliar with privacy snafus, this appeared to be one of the final straws, forcing Facebook CEO to issue a sort of non-apology-ish apology — as well as take out full page (in wildly not-very-engaging full text form, weirdly enough) ads in several major newspapers.","CNN reports that the testimony may come within a matter of weeks amid pressure from lawmakers, the media, and the public.","Zuckerberg in particular has been a face absent in front of Congress, but it appears the pressure from this incident may be too much for the company to handle without getting his face out there in order to neutralize the fallout.

Some users were shocked by what they discovered.","As pointed out by Ars Technica, the social networking site has been logging years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths, and text messages from those who use Android devices.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices.

To that end, we commissioned a survey of 1,153 random U.S. adults (not just DuckDuckGo users), who collectively are demographically similar to the general population of U.S. adults. Surveys were taken on Mar 26th and 27th, 2018. Here are the results.","Awareness","We found that 85.34% +/- 2.04% of U.S. adults are aware of the Cambridge Analytica incident.","Deleting Facebook Accounts","Among those who are aware and who currently have a Facebook account, 37.00% +/- 3.39% state that they're now more likely to delete their Facebook account.","Sharing Less Personal Information with Facebook","Similarly, among those who are aware and who currently have a Facebook account, 60.82% +/- 3.42% plan to share less personal information with Facebook.","Trust in Facebook","More than half (56.00% +/- 3.10%) of those who are aware of the incident disagree with the statement, \"I trust Facebook to take appropriate action to protect it's users' online privacy.\"","Regulation of Facebook","42.58% +/- 3.09% of respondents who are aware of the Cambridge data incident agree with the statement, \"I believe the government should play a greater role in regulating how Facebook handles user data.\" Add to them the 21.44% +/- 2.56% who are neutral, and a solid majority (64.02% +/- 3.00%) are not opposed to the regulation of Facebook.","These responses differ significantly from those who haven't heard of the incident. 42.58% +/- 3.09% of those that have heard of the incident responded that they somewhat agree, agree, or strongly agree with the statement above. Compared with 30.18% +/- 6.92% of those who haven't heard about the incident, the relative change between those groups is 41.10% +/- 25.11%.","Concern for Online Privacy","Moving beyond Facebook, among those who are aware of the incident, 64.23% +/- 2.99% responded that they're now more concerned for their online privacy as a result of the event.","Seeking Tools/Services to Protect Online Privacy","Roughly half (51.12% +/- 3.12%) of those polled who are aware of the Cambridge Analytica incident are now more likely to seek out tools and services to protect their online privacy.","Even if you delete your Facebook account or stop visiting the website entirely, trackers from Facebook still lurk on about 25% of websites. Facebook can still use this tracking to create a \"shadow\" profile about you, and target ads at you via their audience ad network off of Facebook, or if you still use Facebook somewhat, use the browsing history they see to target ads at you on their site.","Privacy Tip: To prevent this ad targeting and additional data collection, you need to use a tracker blocker extension/app, like the one offered by us (DuckDuckGo) on all major browsers and platforms that also includes additional privacy essentials.","In Summary","In just a week and a half, the Cambridge Analytica incident has had a major impact on Americans' sentiment toward Facebook and online privacy. We expect continued shifts in attitudes and behaviors about Facebook and other services as coverage continues to scrutinze poor privacy practices, and the dialogue turns to what we can do about them.","Methodology","These results are based on the polling of a random sample of 1,153 American adults (18+) on March 26th and 27th, 2018 via SurveyMonkey's Audience platform, which ensures the demographic make-up of respondents is representative of the U.S. population. Survey respondents were paid and a confidence level of 95% was used for calculating the values above."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

He and Zuckerberg were chatting over AOL Instant Messenger about Facebook, which was about to expand beyond Harvard to new schools. They decided to discuss Hughes' ownership stake in person.","Hughes grabbed his umbrella and met Zuckerberg by their dorm entrance and, sharing the umbrella, went for a walk — it was a conversation they needed to have in private, without risk of their roommates overhearing.","\"I came out of the gate saying, 'I want 10% of the company,'\" Hughes told us. \"He was stressed; I was stressed. It was not the best setup.\"","Hughes had helped with the site's user experience, and as the cofounder Zuckerberg had deemed him the most socially adept, helped with marketing and arranging the company's earliest media coverage. He felt the 10% ask was \"ambitious, but not entirely unreasonable.\"","As Hughes remembered it in his book, Zuckerberg replied: \"I just don't think you've earned that much. I appreciate what you are doing, and I think you could do a lot more as we grow the site, but I need to keep control. And the others need fair equity too.\"","Hughes said he stayed in silent thought, considering that the conversation might be more important than friends discussing just another startup. The rain was coming down heavily, and they walked quickly under the single umbrella around campus.","\"I am conflict-averse by nature,\" Hughes wrote, and realized he wasn't as confident about his request as he thought, noting that \"my role was secondary and I knew it. I wasn't in a position to make demands, but I was anxious to become more involved.\"","Hughes made a case for himself as they walked, but caved by the time they reached Harvard's central library, Widener.","\"Just give me what you think is fair,\" Hughes remembered telling Zuckerberg. \"I know it's hard to balance all of us.\" Zuckerberg replied with just an \"OK\" and walked off into the rain, without even a hood on.","A few weeks later, Hughes discovered Zuckerberg gave him 2%, the lowest stake of the cofounders by multiples, and the stake would shrink a bit when Facebook was reincorporated later in the year.","This stake, however, still brought Hughes about $500 million after the company's IPO in 2012. He told us that for that reason, that discussion in the rain \"was at once a spectacular failure of negotiation and also the most successful conversation of my life.\"","Have you read?","He's reflected on it lately, extrapolating it to the rest of American society. \"But what keeps happening in this economy is these small chance events have these outsized impacts, because there's a snowballing effect, because of the winner-take-all kind of system,\" he said.","\"So that what seemed like passing conversations in the rain, in college, can have these outsized effects.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows.

Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

In a sense all browsers could now plausibly claim to be 'secure' browsers for the average Joe.","This means that today, more specialised products are now focused on the issue of user privacy, handing back control to the user and opting out of data collection systems of the sort that underpin firms like Google.","It is perfectly possible to fine tune Chrome, Firefox or IE for security and privacy with plugins. Each now has a ‘privacy’ mode - which may or may not convince the sceptic. But the philosophy often behind true secure browsers is to eschew the notion of platforms and plug-ins, stripping back every non-essential feature to create a more minimalist experience.","Tor is the most well-known, but the browser can slow down your internet and lead to connectivity issues, meaning people are increasingly looking for alternatives.","However it should be noted that achieving true privacy online is a fairly difficult task, as it means isolating the machine from public Wi-Fi connections, locking it down with an open source OS, and being conscious of the sites and services you use - considering most depend on harvesting your data for the success of their business.","Therefore, the following browsers (plus one plug-in) are not exhaustive nor will they guarantee you real privacy. However, they’re likely to help somewhat. But note that privacy usually requires compromises so these won't be for everyone.","There are various Chromium-based browsers that promise to cater to privacy (and in some instances de-Google the core browser) but ultimately there's no guarantee this is the case - so we've left those out.","We also discuss Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), such as nordvpn, which can be used in association with the browser you already use to increase privacy.","Read on for the full list...","Firefox","Trusty Firefox from the Mozilla Foundation comes recommended by PrivacyTools.io because with the addition of some add-ons, it can become a seriously privacy-friendly browser. There is a long list of add-ons that can be used to make the Firefox experience more secure, including – but not limited to – HTTPS Everywhere (see below), uBlock Origin, NoScript, Stop Fingerprinting and Windscribe. It also has some privacy features built in such as tracking protection.","Firefox is also just a good, user-friendly open source browser that receives regular updates, has a pleasing UI, delivers in speed performance and is lightweight – with the Mozilla Foundation boasting that it uses 30 percent less memory than Chrome.","However, there have been a number of controversial decisions taken by Mozilla that have upset both casual Firefox fans and die-hard open sourcers who have been with the project since the start.","The two most prominent of these were a plug-in appearing in users' browsers without warning and without their consent called Looking Glass, which turned out to be a promotional plug-in for TV series Mr Robot. Although it was disabled by default, it rightly caused alarm among the userbase who have valued Firefox for its line on privacy and yet was inserting code into users' computers.","Another cause for alarm was an experiment with Cliqz, a privacy-focused browser that Mozilla had invested in. Essentially Mozilla rolled out an engine provided by Cliqz called Human Engine to roughly one percent of users in Germany. There's a great explainer on Reddit - the extremely short version is that Human Engine would scrape user data, although it was anonymised this caused a mild uproar.","There are various forks of Firefox that claim to be privacy-focused (listed below - Waterfox, Pale Moon, Basilisk) but it's up for debate whether they are more overall secure because their development teams are, naturally, way smaller than the contributors to Firefox's code base.","Waterfox","Waterfox is an open source fork from Firefox with telemetry (Mozilla phoning home) turned off completely - which is possible in Firefox but with some tinkering. It also claims to be speedy but your results may vary compared to lightweight browsers like Firefox Quantum. Waterfox also promises to erase all online information from your computer, so passwords, cookies and history, as well as blocking trackers automatically without addons.","Speaking of addons, Waterfox supports legacy Firefox extensions. The Waterfox subreddit is fairly active and its creator says that it will continue to be supported with updates and patches, although these won't be as regular as Firefox. It's available on desktop and Android.","Pale Moon","A lightweight open source desktop browser forked from old Firefox code (technically a fork from Mozilla's Gecko browser engine to the open source Goanna), Pale Moon touts \"efficiency and customisation\" as two of its selling points. It is regularly being updated with the latest version released in August 2018 at time of publication. You might find some compatibility issues with addons.","Yet another independent fork from Mozilla/Firefox code with the Goanna engine, the Pale Moon team also recently announced Basilisk, a free and open source XUL-based browser. We've not created a separate entry for Basilisk because the developers say it's development software, and so should be \"considered more or less 'beta' at more times\", although it is still worth investigating bearing that in mind.","HTTPS Everywhere","Browser plug-in HTTPS Everywhere is an EFF/Tor project that enforces SSL security wherever that’s possible in Chrome, Firefox and Opera. It promises to make what would otherwise be a complex and uncertain process much simpler because it is easy to start out using HTTPS on a website and be sent back to non-HTTPS pages without realising it.","Downsides? It’s another plug-in of course, but it’s worth it. A boon for café surfers everywhere.","Tor","The granddaddy of privacy browsers, Tor has become the watchword for the anti-surveillance movement because it is built on an entire infrastructure of ‘hidden' relay servers. Because it bounces your connection through a number of distributed nodes, it should obscure the public IP address you are connecting to the internet with.","Built atop a modified Firefox, it can be installed on a Windows, Mac or Linux PC but also on a USB stick if that's preferable.","The important thing to remember about Tor is that it is really an advanced privacy browser rather than a secure one, in that it includes no anti-malware technology and blocks plug-ins by design.It’s designed to anonymise a user within certain constraints such as the requirement to use only HTTPS connections (enforced by HTTPS Everywhere – see above).","The Tor Project offers a list of do and don’t for using it securely, including being very careful about downloading and opening documents which require external applications.","Downsides? Using Tor will be slower than with other browsers and it can be demanding to use to its full privacy potential. Some people think that anyone who uses Tor is trying to hide something. Of course they are right. If privacy is that important, let them think what they want.","Brave","Announced by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla Project, Brave is an open source browser that offers a respectable Chrome, Safari, and Firefox alternative.","Brave offers great speeds and advanced ad-tracking controls, ideal for the privacy-conscious who are also after a lightweight browser.","Available for Windows, Linux and OS X users, Brave includes HTTPS Everywhere integration, blocks cookie capture, features a decent ad-blocker, and has an active developer community which is always improving the browser.","Downsides? It's still a relatively new browser, so perhaps not as polished a product as it could be, and extension functionality is still lacking.","Epic","Based on Chromium - the open-source Web browser project founded by Google -Epic is a browser that strips out every conceivable feature to maximise privacy. Cookies and trackers are eliminated after each session, all searches are proxied through the firm’s own servers (which means there is no way to connect an IP address to a search), and it attempts to prioritise SSL connections wherever possible - useful for open Wi-Fi connections. It does not collect data about its users and comes with excellent built-in ad blocking.","For a fully encrypted connection, it includes a one-button proxying feature that does slow down browsing but will appeal to some users (but can’t necessarily be used as a regional bypass proxy because Epic’s servers are based in the US). Despite eschewing plug-ins, a handful are available to make life a bit easier, for example password manager LastPass.","Downsides? Epic's one-click proxy does slightly slow browsing speed, although for high-spec machines this shouldn't be an issue.","It is also a closed shop – a proprietary browser based on an open source project (Chromium) is unlikely to keep pace with the latter for updates and patches. And although Epic claims to have removed Google’s tracking features the fact that it’s based on Chromium means you’re still sort-of using a Google product. Why opt for a closed shop Google offshoot when there are actually open source alternatives available?","Yandex Browser","Yandex is a Chromium re-skin with a pleasing, minimal UI that doesn't stray too far from Google Chrome in design and features, and can import your Chrome preferences.","Yandex, Russia’s biggest tech company, makes use of the 'Blink' engine, which runs checks through downloads and uses Kaspersky's antivirus to scan for malicious content.","Normally when browsers run scans they become sluggish, and Yandex has tried to address this. The browser uses Opera's Turbo technology to optimise web pages that are underperforming or working across an unstable network.","Yandex also blocks website containing malicious content and protects passwords and bank card details that are stored. This means it makes your online payments more secure.","In terms of its anonymity provisions, it prevents third parties from tracking your browsing behaviour and location. It uses DNSCrypt technology that encrypts Domain Name System (DNS - how domain names are translated into IP addresses) traffic as well as hiding your true IP address.","Users might want to exercise caution for the fact that it is closed-source and proprietary, so you don’t truly know what’s happening to your data (other than Google’s not getting it).","This browser runs on Windows 7, Mac and Linux.","Freenet","Freenet is a peer-to-peer secure platform that allows communication and publishing without censorship and anonymous and secure web browsing. It stores encrypted data in a distributed, decentralised network. It supports Darknet and OpenNet technologies, through which connection with other users is facilitated.","The lack of a central server means that it is very difficult to hack Freenet.","I2P (also known as the invisible internet project)","This is an anonymous network which facilitates the secure and private exchange of messages. It utilises DarkNet technology to provide protection from tracking by third parties like internet service providers.","It’s layered encryption of network traffic and communication means your data is both anonymous and protected.","Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)","VPNs work by connecting two computers securely and privately over the internet. When you open up a web browser and enter a URL on your device, the request is sent to the VPN server. The server then acts as an intermediary, requesting the web page from the site and sending it back to you. That means the website can only see the VPN server - not the client device requesting it.","This information is encrypted, meaning external parties can't see the information exchanged. VPNs also mask the location of the client, allowing you to access location-specific services in other countries. Read more information on VPNs here."],"isopubdate":"2018-08-28"}

We expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all the organisations involved to cooperate fully.”","It comes a day after Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, accused Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive of making “false statements” to MPs.","Alexander Nix “deliberately misled the committee and Parliament” by denying his company had received data from the Global Science Research (GSR) company, Mr Collins said in a statement, referencing reports in The Observer that tens of millions of Facebook users’ data had been captured by GSR in a deal with Cambridge Analytica.","But Cambridge Analytica denied Mr Nix’s testimony was misleading, saying it “strongly refutes that reporting because it is wrong”.","A spokesperson told The Independent: “Alexander Nix did not mislead the committee. He told the committee that Cambridge Analytica had received data from GSR in relation to a research project that they undertook on our behalf in 2014.","“He went on to say that Cambridge Analytica does not hold or use any data received from GSR. This is because Cambridge Analytica, in cooperation with Facebook, deleted all data and derivatives received from GSR after it came to light that GSR, as data controller, had contravened its contract with Cambridge Analytica and Facebook’s terms of service.","“None of this data was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","The company was “very happy” to answer further questions from Mr Collins and the committee, it added.","Its statement appeared to contradict the official transcript of the 27 February oral evidence session on whether it had received data from GSR, however. Mr Nix’s exchange with Mr Collins on that topic is recorded as:","Chair: Does any of your data comes from Global Science Research company?","Alexander Nix: GSR?","Chair: Yes.","Alexander Nix: We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.","Chair: They have not supplied you with data or information?","Alexander Nix: No.","Chair: Your datasets are not based with information you have received from them?","Alexander Nix: No.","Chair: At all?","Alexander Nix: At all.","The Independent has asked Cambridge Analytica for further comment.","On Sunday Mr Collins also pointed the finger at Facebook, saying: “Data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns.","“Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it, and deliberately avoided answering straight questions from the Committee about it.”","Mark Zuckerberg should personally answer MPs’ questions, he said.","The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Mozilla, Tesla and other companies are distancing themselves from Facebook following revelations of a major leak of user data to political consultants associated with the 2016 Trump campaign. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP, File)","LONDON (AP) -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company's subscribers. The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","\"For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,\" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. \"I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.\"","The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized \"the right to be forgotten,\" allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","\"The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,\" said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking \"I Agree.\" The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to \"bracket off\" European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.","\"Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,\" she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. \"We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,\" it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","\"Cambridge Analytica's story sounds like a spy novel,\" he said. \"It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix.

It was noted that Apple’s iOS “has never allowed silent access to call data.”","It was further noted that Facebook provides a means for users to supposedly purge such collected data from their archives, but it was unclear if that purge only amounted to deleting stored contact lists while leaving the metadata in place.","Do you think Facebook has gone too far in abridging the trust of user privacy concerns?","YesNo","Completing this poll entitles you to Conservative Tribune news updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.","You're logged in to Facebook. Click here to log out.","In fact, Gallagher himself attempted to purge his archive of collected data, only to find days later that the stored data could still be found.","The Ars article was updated to include a response from Facebook to this revelation, but their response seemed to contradict the experience of Gallagher, McKay and several others, and also seemed to avoid directly addressing the privacy concerns in regard to their collection and storage of call and text metadata.","“Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android,” wrote a Facebook spokesperson. “This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provide you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature.”","Advertisement - story continues below","“If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted,” the spokesperson added. “While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.”","Except that, as mentioned above, it wasn’t exactly “opt-in only” as stated by Facebook, as earlier versions of Android’s operating system featured the “opt-in” as part of their default settings, without the issuance of a separate notification about the data collection.","It should be noted that the newest version of Android’s system no longer does the “opt-in” by default — though some older apps may still do it — and Facebook swears up and down that they keep such metadata secure and would never sell it to third parties.","Then again, a lot of people have reason to doubt Facebook’s word these days, and they still have yet to provide any sort of acceptable reason why they needed to collect and store such information in the first place, as it goes far above and beyond simply trying to “help friends find each other.”","Ben Marquis lives in Little Rock, Arkansas.

{"originalurl":"https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/03/23/nothing/","title":"Doc Searls Weblog · Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica problems are nothing compared to what’s coming for all of online publishing","text":["Let’s start with Facebook’s Surveillance Machine, by Zeynep Tufekci in last Monday’s New York Times. Among other things (all correct), Zeynep explains that “Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook’s true customers, whom it works hard to please.”","Irony Alert: the same is true for the Times, along with every other publication that lives off adtech: tracking-based advertising. These pubs don’t just open the kimonos of their readers. They bring readers’ bare digital necks to vampires ravenous for the blood of personal data, all for the purpose of aiming “interest-based” advertising at those same readers, wherever those readers’ eyeballs may appear—or reappear in the case of “retargeted” advertising.","With no control by readers (beyond tracking protection which relatively few know how to use, and for which there is no one approach, standard or experience), and no blood valving by the publishers who bare those readers’ necks, who knows what the hell actually happens to the data?","Note that I have the data leak toward Facebook.net blocked by default.","Here’s a view through RedMorph’s controller pop-down:","And here’s what happens when I turn off “Block Trackers and Content”:","By the way, I want to make clear that Zeynep, Brian, Natasha and Sue are all innocents here, thanks both to the “Chinese wall” between the editorial and publishing functions of the Times, and the simple fact that the route any ad takes between advertiser and reader through any number of adtech intermediaries is akin to a ball falling through a pinball machine. Refresh your page while reading any of those pieces and you’ll see a different set of ads, no doubt aimed by automata guessing that you, personally, should be “impressed” by those ads. (They’ll count as “impressions” whether you are or not.)","Now…","What will happen when the Times, the New Yorker and other pubs own up to the simple fact that they are just as guilty as Facebook of leaking their readers’ data to other parties, for—in many if not most cases—God knows what purposes besides “interest-based” advertising? And what happens when the EU comes down on them too? It’s game-on after 25 May, when the EU can start fining violators of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Key fact: the GDPR protects the data blood of what they call “EU data subjects” wherever those subjects’ necks are exposed in borderless digital world.","Facebook left its API wide open, and had no control over personal data once those data left Facebook.","But there is a wider story coming: (thread…)","Every single big website in the world is leaking data in a similar way, through “RTB bid requests” for online behavioural advertising #adtech.","Every time an ad loads on a website, the site sends the visitor’s IP address (indicating physical location), the URL they are looking at, and details about their device, to hundreds -often thousands- of companies. Here is a graphic that shows the process.","The website does this to let these companies “bid” to show their ad to this visitor. Here is a video of how the system works. In Europe this accounts for about a quarter of publishers’ gross revenue.","Once these personal data leave the publisher, via “bid request”, the publisher has no control over what happens next. I repeat that: personal data are routinely sent, every time a page loads, to hundreds/thousands of companies, with no control over what happens to them.","This means that every person, and what they look at online, is routinely profiled by companies that receive these data from the websites they visit. Where possible, these data and combined with offline data. These profiles are built up in “DMPs”.","None of this will be legal under the #GDPR. (See one reason why at https://t.co/HXOQ5gb4dL). Publishers and brands need to take care to stop using personal data in the RTB system. Data connections to sites (and apps) have to be carefully controlled by publishers.","So far, #adtech’s trade body has been content to cover over this wholesale personal data leakage with meaningless gestures that purport to address the #GDPR (see my note on @IABEurope current actions here: https://t.co/FDKBjVxqBs). It is time for a more practical position.","And advertisers, who pay for all of this, must start to demand that safe, non-personal data take over in online RTB targeting. RTB works without personal data. Brands need to demand this to protect themselves – and all Internet users too. @dwheld @stephan_lo @BobLiodice","Websites need to control\n1. which data they release in to the RTB system\n2. whether ads render directly in visitors’ browsers (where DSPs JavaScript can drop trackers)\n3. what 3rd parties get to be on their page\n@jason_kint @epc_angela @vincentpeyregne @earljwilkinson 11/12","Lets work together to fix this. 12/12","Those last three recommendations are all good, but they also assume that websites, advertisers and their third party agents are the ones with the power to do something. Not readers.","But there’s lots readers will be able to do. More about that shortly. Meanwhile, publishers can get right with readers by dropping #adtech and go back to publishing the kind of high-value brand advertising they’ve run since forever in the physical world.","Going back to real advertising is the easiest fix in the world, but so far it’s nearly unthinkable because we’ve been defaulted for more than twenty years to an asymmetric power relationship between readers and publishers called client-server. I’ve been told that client-server was chosen as the name for this relationship because “slave-master” didn’t sound so good; but I think the best way to visualize it is calf-cow:","As I put it at that link (way back in 2012), Client-server, by design, subordinates visitors to websites. It does this by putting nearly all responsibility on the server side, so visitors are just users or consumers, rather than participants with equal power and shared responsibility in a truly two-way relationship between equals.","It doesn’t have to be that way. Beneath the Web, the Net’s TCP/IP protocol—the gravity that holds us all together in cyberspace—remains no less peer-to-peer and end-to-end than it was in the first place. Meaning there is nothing to the Net that prevents each of us from having plenty of power on our own.","Customer Commons is working on exactly those terms. The first publication to agree to readers terms is Linux Journal, where I am now the editor-in-chief. The first of those terms will say “just show me ads not based on tracking me,” and is hashtagged #DoNotByte.","Obeying readers’ terms also carries no risk of violating privacy laws, because every pub will have contracts with its readers to do the right thing. This is totally do-able. Read that last link to see how.","As I say there, we need help. Linux Journal still has a small staff, and Customer Commons (a California-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit) so far consists of five board members. What it aims to be is a worldwide organization of customers, as well as the place where terms we proffer can live, much as Creative Commons is where personal copyright licenses live. (Customer Commons is modeled on Creative Commons. Hats off to the Berkman Klein Center for helping bring both into the world.)","I’m also hoping other publishers, once they realize that they are no less a part of the surveillance economy than Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, will help out too.","I think the best push-back I got there came from Esteban Kolsky, (@ekolsky) who (as I recall anyway) saw less than full moral equivalence between what Facebook and Cambridge Analytica did to screw with democracy and what the New York Times and other ad-supported pubs do by baring the necks of their readers to dozens of data vampires.","He’s right that they’re not equivalent, any more than apples and oranges are equivalent. The sins are different; but they are still sins, just as apples and oranges are still both fruit. Exposing readers to data vampires is simply wrong on its face, and we need to fix it. That it’s normative in the extreme is no excuse. Nor is the fact that it makes money. There are morally uncompromised ways to make money with advertising, and those are still available.","[Later again (8 April 2018)…] About the comments below (60+ so far): the version of commenting used by this blog doesn’t support threading. If it did, my responses to comments would appear below each one. Alas, some not only appear out of sequence, but others don’t appear at all. I don’t know why, but I’m trying to find out. Meanwhile, apologies.","Users pay for the internet with their data and marketers target that data which pays for content creation. There’s a trade-off to changing this relationship: do you want a democratized source of information (the web as it stands today) or do you want to create a world where people pay on, say, a pay-per-page-view or monthly-subscription model where you’ve created a world where the wealthy are the only ones with unlimited access to information? Imagine having to pay $5/month for every site you use (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, CNN, WSJ, Snopes) – it adds up fast and you still have a $100/month cable and internet bill to pay!). Now imagine trying to click a link from WSJ that leads to a page source that you’re not subscribed to, your ability to investigate information and form your own opinion is now throttled.\n–\n–\nI’m all for data privacy but I want to ensure everyone has access to the world’s information. Wikipedia, Craigslist, Khan Academy, and very few others have managed to provide this with an ad-free model and, as great as they are, they are not enough to get the world the world’s information. As you called out, TCP/IP is peer-to-peer – so a new protocol that lives in parallel to HTTP needs to be created in order for users to have control of their data yet ensure marketers have the ability to target people, ensuring the web is democratic. What other payment model is there?\n–\n–\nAlso, GDPR is slightly misstated here: it’s not going to fix all those issues, it states that every time a cookie is created from a source (a site), that the propagation of selling of that cookie must be tracked so if the user ops-out from that source all downstream sources will have to remove it from their systems. Meaning users have to go to opt-out of every site they go to. It’s a great step but I can’t imagine it sustaining for long as users will not want to go through that effort every-single-time they go to a website (or even page, I’m not sure the detail of the opt-out requirements).","Did you pay a license fee for the iceberg image? It’s just that the distortion suggests it might be a web grab and I’m being quoted $250 for one year non-commercial social media use with that image. Maybe Harvard have an account and get a package discount, but if not surveillance by PicScout could have you paying a substantial penalty if caught.","First, funding models. Advertising itself isn’t a problem. We’ve had it forever in offline publications, and online as well until about ten years ago, when tracking people for the purpose of advertising at them — known in the offline world as direct response marketing and in the online one as “adtech” — became the norm. I unpack this in Separating Advertising’s Wheat and Chaff. Don Marti, Bob Hoffman, myself and others have for years been making the case for a return to real advertising, and for its far greater branding and economic signal carrying power. (After a $trillion or so has been spent on adtech, not one brand known to the world has been created by it. Meanwhile, way more than a billion people have chosen to block ads: a sum that began to increase when the “interactive” ad industry decided summarily not to respect Do Not Track requests in browsers, and has increased roughly in step with the increase in tracking. So the choice is less between advertising and subscription than between advertising and direct response marketing.","Second, thanks for the clarification of the GDPR. Clearly the letter of the regulation allows the cookie-based mess you outline well. But the spirit of the regulation clearly wishes to outlaw unwanted tracking itself. The solutions some of us (myself included) are working on address both, but especially the latter. We believe there is a better alignment of all parties’ incentives in an online publishing world where tracking for direct response marketing purposes is an exception requested by the individual rather than a norm in which the agency of the individual is uninvolved.","Anon, the search by which I found the original iceberg image was one that led me to believe it was licensed for re-use non-commercially and for modification. Since you suggest it’s not, I found and substituted this one from Wikimedia Commons.","The interesting thing about this is that media organizations are just fighting for the scraps from what the big tech companies. Unfortunately, by pursuing an aggressive ad and tracking policy, they may lose on both sides — still not catch up with tech companies and lose audiences’ trust. I don’t want to imagine what that would mean for democracy.","We’ll get a better 404 message than “You are not authorized…” Bear with us in the meantime. The site is brand new after a long and difficult migration. (Our archives go back to 1994, and we are doing our best not to 404 any of them.)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

Not what a pie chart circulating on social media says.","We found this pie chart's assumptions to be problematic.","Is federal spending on the military about 50 times higher than on food stamps? That’s the message of a pie chart now circulating on the Internet.","The pie chart is headlined, \"Look closely at this chart of federal spending.\" It says spending on the \"military\" accounts for 57 percent of the federal dollar, with other categories ranging from 1 percent to 6 percent.","The caption says, \"Somewhere within the tiny orange sliver at the bottom is the food stamp program that Republicans blame for our budget deficit. And so ends today’s lesson in Republican logic.\"","To check the accuracy of this pie chart, we had to make a few assumptions. For starters, the chart isn’t dated, so we used estimated figures for fiscal year 2015. And since the chart uses some non-standard categories for federal spending, we had to make a few assumptions about which departmental spending should be placed in what category.","That said, we found some fundamental problems with the graphic’s calculations and conclusions. To understand them, we’ll first provide some background on how federal spending works.","Most federal spending can be categorized as discretionary or mandatory. The levels of discretionary spending are determined through the congressional appropriations process, with both houses of Congress and the president ultimately signing off on an agreed level of spending. Most spending by cabinet departments and independent agencies falls under this category, and it’s \"discretionary\" in the sense that if political leaders want to raise, or lower, the amount of spending for a given purpose, they can do so by tinkering with appropriations bills.","The other major category is mandatory spending, which is sometimes referred to as \"entitlements.\" Spending within this category is determined by a formula, and the big pieces are three familiar programs: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. For each mandatory program, the amount spent is tied directly to the number of people deemed eligible by age or income level. These programs effectively run on autopilot unless Congress changes the formula, making this type of spending more insulated from lawmakers and the president than discretionary spending.","With that background, let’s now take a look at how the figures in the pie chart compare to a breakdown of fiscal 2015 discretionary spending (the third column), and to fiscal 2015 total spending (that is, discretionary plus mandatory spending, in the final column).","The pie chart’s figures aren’t far off if you’re looking just at discretionary spending, though even here there are some differences. For instance, the pie chart significantly understates the amount of spending going to health and energy.","More problematic, though, is that the pie chart ignores mandatory spending. About 60 percent of all federal spending is considered mandatory, with 34 percent considered discretionary and 6 percent devoted to interest. In other words, the chart, despite referring broadly to \"federal spending,\" only counts about one-third of federal spending -- the discretionary part.","If we look at all of federal spending, the picture changes:","• The \"military\" share, including spending on homeland security, shrinks from 57 percent to 16 percent.","• The \"health\" share zooms from 5 percent to 26 percent, once expenditures on Medicare and Medicaid are counted.","• Social Security -- a category not even included in the pie chart now circulating on social media feeds -- rises from 0 percent to 25 percent.","• Food and agriculture quadruples from 1 percent to 4 percent due to the inclusion of food stamps, a mandatory program, and agricultural income and price supports.","Calculating it this way severely undercuts the graphic’s message. Rather than the federal budget being dominated by the military, the budget is actually dominated by spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. In fact. the ratio of military spending to food and agriculture spending in the full budget is 4-to-1, rather than 57-to-1.","A more accurate representation would be this one:","Our ruling","A social-media meme says that 57 percent of federal spending goes to the military and just 1 percent goes to food and agriculture, including food stamps.","To get numbers that approximate this, the pie chart cherry-picks just discretionary spending. But that means the pie chart represents only about one-third of federal spending. Once you include the 60 percent of the budget that is mandatory spending, the military share plunges from 57 percent to 16 percent, and the categories that include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid collectively account for a majority of federal spending. Spending on food and agriculture is still small, but it does quadruple from 1 percent to 4 percent.","Due to its skewed methodology, the pie chart offers a deeply distorted picture of federal spending. We rate the claim False.","How to contact us","Email comments and suggestions for fact-checks to [email protected] or find us on Facebook,and Twitter.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

It's no surprise that the data ended up being used again on Facebook, one of the biggest advertising platforms on Earth.","This weekend, while Facebook was quibbling about whether the information used by Cambridge Analytica to target voters in the lead up to the 2016 election was obtained in a data “breach” or somehow using fraudulent means, I decided to check my privacy settings.","Since creating a Facebook in 2006, I have associated my account with 100 separate third party apps. Besides common ones like Spotify, Venmo, and Uber, I have given access to my account to apps like “Typing Maniac,” “I bet I can guess your favorite color,” and “Crazy Cabbie,” among others. Many of these apps I remember only as a faint memory. According to these settings, however, lots of these apps still have access to the same information Cambridge Analytica used to target Facebook users with political ads that helped Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election.","The app was hosted by a company called MetroGames, whose privacy policy notes that the company “may also collect information about the User from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, [and] instant messaging services.” The privacy policy says it shared identifying personal information with third parties only when “permitted by the User” but also said that it used anonymized data regardless of a user’s settings: “We do this primarily for personalizing advertisements and promotions. We regard this as a benefit for the User.”","I do not know what MetroGames—which has gone out of business—ultimately did with my data. But between the hundred apps I’ve given access to my Facebook, there’s a good chance at least one of them has sold my information to data brokers and ultimately used to target me on Facebook and elsewhere. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment for this article.","“You have to proceed on the assumption that this information has been extracted from you,” Woodrow Hartzog, author of Privacy’s Blueprint: The Battle to Control the Design of New Technologies, told me on the phone. “Cambridge Analytica used an information extraction technique that was well-known to technologists for years. The implications of this debacle is about crystallizing the threat about how dangerous the information ecosystem is.”","Just some of the apps that have access to at least some of my information. Image: Jason Koebler/Facebook","The point I am trying to make is that, though Cambridge Analytica’s specific use of user data to help a political campaign is something we haven’t publicly seen on this scale before, it is exactly the type of use that Facebook’s platform is designed for, has facilitated for years, and continues to facilitate every day. At its core, Facebook is an advertising platform that makes almost all of its money because it and the companies that use its platform know so much about you.","Facebook continues to be a financially successful company precisely because its platform has enabled the types of person-specific targeting that Cambridge Analytica did.","Though Facebook technically asks apps not to sell user information to data brokers, researchers say that enforcement is rare and that many fly-by-night companies have historically popped up, gathered information, and then sold that data (or sold the entire company itself) to marketing firms and data brokers. It would be difficult for Facebook to even know this was happening, and many companies would simply be kicked off Facebook once it had already harvested data.","Facebook partners with data brokers to help make its information more effective. Image: Jason Koebler","The way Cambridge Analytica obtained the data of millions of Americans has been done—and in many ways is still being done—by many different data broker firms throughout the United States and the world. The same data that is used every day to sell shoes and meditation apps is used to sell us political candidates, too. Whether Cambridge Analytica misused the data or obtained it in some nefarious way is beside the point—thousands of apps have been used to gather information about millions of Facebook users, and there is little stopping them from selling that data to other people.","“I think there should be concern about other apps engaging in digital strip mining,” Hartzog said. “They create a generic type of app that might be somewhat appealing to users, they get as much information as they can, and they get out. There’s a huge incentive to get the data, and there’s not much penalty for doing it. Not from Facebook and not within our legal structure.”","Cambridge Analytica got much of its data from a Facebook personality test called “thisisyourdigitallife” that was much like many of the games I and millions of other people signed up for years ago. These types of apps were trojan horses to gain access to profiles that could then be resold.","This was not incidental, it was the business model of the apps. I ultimately don’t know if MetroGames sold my data, but many similar apps were created and were eventually purchased by marketing firms and data brokers.","\"People were writing apps manically—photo of the day, quizzes, any sort of garbage people would install so you would have a big user base to take the data. And there were absolutely cases where people developed Facebook apps for fun, got a huge user base, and then sold the apps for hundreds of thousands of dollars to a marketing company.\"","In this way, companies were not technically breaking their privacy policies—by purchasing Facebook app companies, the “third party” data brokers suddenly because the first-party owners of the data. For example, a data analytics company called RapLeaf was caught purchasing user information from various Facebook apps. Facebook eventually shut down RapLeaf, but the company simply sold itself to two data brokers, Acxiom and Tower Data. Today, Acxiom is a “Facebook Marketing Partner” which allows would-be advertisers to supplement that information they already have with the data that Acxiom has already gathered.","“Once Facebook created the [data sharing] API, there was a land grab,” Christo Wilson, a researcher at Northeastern University who has studied Facebook advertising and third-party data sharing tactics, told me on the phone. “People were writing apps manically—photo of the day, quizzes, any sort of garbage people would install so you would have a big user base to take the data. It was a huge market back in the day. And there were absolutely cases where people developed Facebook apps for fun, got a huge user base, and then sold the apps for hundreds of thousands of dollars to a marketing company.”","Granting an app access to your Facebook profile gave it a “token” that could then be used—in many cases indefinitely—by the app to access your data, according to Wilson.","Wilson said that in the course of their research, he and colleague Alan Mislove created apps to determine what types of information could be harvested by data brokers and advertisers; that “thisisyourdigitallife” was nominally created for academic research ultimately has no bearing on what data was collected and how it was ultimately used. Thousands of other apps have harvested the same data.","“You told us you had 100 apps installed—you’re not the only one,” Wilson said. “I have restrictions on my behavior because of things like institutional review, but 99.9 percent of these apps were commercial for the purposes of monetizing people.”","An API change in 2015 made data sharing more restrictive—Facebook no longer allowed apps to take your data simply because your friend had installed an app—but third party apps could still collect data directly from your profile if you gave them permission. And because of the way Facebook’s advertising products work, once data was taken, it remained valuable to data brokers, who collate and compile information for advertisers. Much of the damage is already done.","\"The incentive is to extract every iota of value out of users\"","Data brokers create databases of information that’s pulled from Facebook and elsewhere. And once taken off the platform, data can be analyzed and re-imported later to be used to target people. Facebook allows advertisers to upload .CSV spreadsheets of information about people and use that information to specifically target people using its “Custom Audiences” product. That data can then be further used to target “Lookalike Audiences” on Facebook—people that data brokers might not know much about but who Facebook itself does know a lot about, according to Mislove.","Facebook’s partnerships with data brokers like Acxiom and Experian allow advertisers to leverage what Facebook knows about you with what data brokers know about you to create a more complex profile of who you are.","Together, Facebook and data brokers have made a list of things that it thinks I like, based on my likes, my apps, my web behavior, and, crutially, what data brokers already know about me. It also creates a rough profile of who I am:","Facebook knows I live away from my family, my political leanings, that I travel often, that I use an iPhone 7 Plus, and much more information. Image: Jason Koebler/Facebook","“If I was Cambridge Analytica, I would have taken 50 million users worth of data, crunched the numbers and figured out who was susceptible to influence,” Mislove said. “Then I’d upload that data back to Facebook as a custom audience and ask Facebook for lookalikes of those people, who are new people I didn’t know about but who are susceptible.”","When I signed up for these hundred apps years ago, I generally had two choices: Accept the terms, or not play the game. In recent years, Facebook has allowed for greater, app-specific privacy setting control, but the fact remains that Facebook makes its money by selling advertisements, and those advertisements are more valuable to companies—and Facebook—because Facebook and the companies it works with can target you, specifically.","Though Facebook has made a few changes to make privacy control better, that basic calculus has not changed, and the old adage still applies: If you’re not paying for something, you are the product.","“The incentive is to extract every iota of value out of users,” Hartzog said. “The service is built around those incentives. You have to convince people to share as much information as possible so you click on as many ads as possible and then feel good about doing it. This is the operating ethos for the entire social internet.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

In fact, it has emerged that the social network of Mark Zuckerberg has collected for years information such as call histories and text data on users who use smartphones with the Google operating system.","Numerous Twitter users have revealed that they have found months, and even years, of call history in their downloadable Facebook files. This is a decidedly burning news, especially after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. ” Ah well … my deleted ZIP file contains information that covers the span of about a year on every single smartphone call and every message sent, ” wrote Twitter user Mat Johnson. Dylan McKay said that “somehow [Facebook] has memorized all my call history with my mother’s partner”. Other users have reported similar situations, with details regarding people with whom they have close contacts, such as family members.","Ars Technica explains that Facebook asks for access to contacts, SMS and call log data on Android devices to improve its friend suggestion algorithm, and to distinguish business contacts from friends and relatives. Facebook would collect such data through its Messenger application, which often suggests users be set as default client for SMS.","Despite his attempt to clarify, Ars Technica points out that in the past Android was not a security standard operating system, and that therefore Facebook could have exploited the situation. However, it is important to clarify that Google has applied changes to the permissions of its operating system to make them clearer.","Facebook has provided an explanation for these discoveries, stating that this is actually a normal thing: ” The most important part of the apps and services that help you connect with other users is to make it easier for you to search for people you want to connect with. So, when you first log into a social network or a messaging app on your smartphone, uploading your contacts is a first step widely used ».","The collection of data on calls and SMS was not however found on iOS devices. Apple allows some specific apps to access such data in a limited way to block spam calls or SMS, and these same apps are enabled through a process very similar to that of third-party keyboards. Most iOS apps cannot access the history of calls and messages, and Facebook for iPhone and iPad is among them.","In short, a new grain for Facebook, which probably will have to provide more explanations on this practice adopted for years now.

It's right. What really happened is much worse.","On Saturday, an investigation by The New York Times, the Guardian, and its sister publication The Observer revealed that the data analytics firm that helped the Donald Trump presidential campaign had harvested the Facebook data of more than 50 million people in an effort to profile users and eventually target them with political ads.","Advertisement","In 2014, a researcher collected the data through an app that asked users to take a personality test for academic research purposes. Around 270,000 people agreed to have their data collected through the test, which its creator, Aleksandr Kogan, defined as “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.” But thanks to Facebook’s terms of service and its API at the time, the app was also able to collect data of their friends. This gave the researcher, who later handed the data to Cambridge Analytica, the raw information of more than 50 million people, according to the reports, which were largely based on the account of a former Cambridge Analytica data scientist.","The Observer called it one of Facebook’s “biggest ever data breaches.” The Times only referred to the incident as a “breach” once, using the term “leak” throughout the rest of the article. We at Motherboard believe the use of the expression “data breach” in this case is incorrect and may be confusing to readers.","As the news spread and echoed online, several websites and other publications called it a data breach. Manysecurityexperts and researchers—and Facebook itself—believe this is the wrong expression to refer to what happened here.","“It is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Facebook’s chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote in a deleted tweet.","Facebook’s vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false,” because the researcher who made the app obtained the data from “users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.”","Got a tip? You can contact this reporter securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, OTR chat at lorenzo@jabber.ccc.de, or email lorenzo@motherboard.tv","Advertisement","Saying that “everyone involved” consented seems misleading, given that only around 270,000 out of the 50 million people who got their data harvested reportedly signed up for the app. The others probably had no idea this app even existed. And since Facebook changes its privacy settings so frequently, we also don't know if the people who agreed to use the app fully understood what kind of data they were giving up. And no one at the time knew the data would later be handed out to a shadowy data analytics firm hired by the Trump campaign.","While we understand why some are describing the data Kogan handed to Cambridge Analytica as a breach, based on what’s been reported so far, we believe that describing this incident as a breach would, at least at the moment, mislead our readers.","We’ve been regularly covering data breaches for years. No one hacked into Facebook’s servers exploiting a bug, like hackers did when they stole the personal data of more than 140 million people from Equifax. No one tricked Facebook users into giving away their passwords and then stole their data, like Russian hackers did when they broke into the email accounts of John Podesta and others through phishing emails.","In 2014, when Kogan collected the data of 50 million people, he was playing by the rules. At the time, Facebook allowed third party apps to collect not only the data of the people who consented to giving it up, but also their friends’ data. The company later shut down this functionality.","Facebook says the data was misused because Kogan told Facebook he would use it only for academic research. But that might be the only anomalous thing about this case.","Facebook obviously doesn't want the public to think it suffered a massive security breach, like Yahoo did in 2013 and 2014. We agree not because we want to minimize the significance of the Cambridge Analytica story, but because the real story is far more troubling: This data collection was par for the course. In other words, it was a feature, not a bug. And while the process that Kogan exploited is no longer allowed, Facebook still collects—and then sells—massive amounts of data on its users.","Advertisement","As Zeynep Tufekci, the author of Twitter And Tear Gas, put it, Facebook’s vehement defense that this was not a data breach is itself actually a damning statement of what’s wrong with Facebook, and Silicon Valley’s ad industry in general.","“If your business is building a massive surveillance machinery, the data will eventually be used & misused,” Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies the social impact of technology, wrote on Twitter. “There is no informed consent because it's not possible to reasonably inform or consent.”","Facebook’s security team, Tufekci concluded, can’t mitigate the company’s business model, which is predicated on collecting as much of our data, and our friend’s data, as possible.","We can condemn the misuse of this data, and Facebook’s data collection practices, without calling it a data breach, a term that may confuse readers and distract them from what we believe is the real problem here: Silicon Valley giants have built massive data collection machines with almost no guardrails on how they are used."],"isopubdate":""}

He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.","“The was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time,” Zuckerberg said in the ads. “We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”","‘FUTURE REGULATION’","His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany’s justice minister said Facebook’s promises were not enough.","“In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,” Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.","Advertisers and users are also unhappy.","U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet’s YouTube for one week.","Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.","Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.","Reporting by David Shepardson; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Susan Thomas"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

I’m confident that social media is a cancer on our private lives and a source of derangement in our politics. I take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections, and that they’ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data. I take a certain mordant pleasure in watching Mark Zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late-Obama-era liberalism.","But the liberal establishment’s fixation on Facebook’s 2016 sins — first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the Trump campaign or its appendages — still feels like a classic example of blaming something new because it’s new when it’s the old thing that mattered more. Or of blaming something new because you thought that “new” meant “good,” that the use of social-media data by campaigns would always help tech-savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals — and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the Trump era a reality.","No doubt all the activity on Facebook and the apparent use of Facebook’s data had some impact, somewhere, on Trump’s surprise victory. But the media format that really made him president, the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited, wasn’t Zuckerberg’s unreal kingdom; it wasn’t even the Twitter platform where Trump struts and frets and rages daily. It was that old pre-internet standby, broadcast and cable television, and especially TV news.","Start with the fake news that laid the foundation for Trump’s presidential campaign — not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your Facebook feed, but the sort broadcast in prime time by NBC, under the label of reality TV. Yes, as media sophisticates we’re all supposed to know that “reality” means “fake,” but in the beginning nobody marketed “The Apprentice” that way; across most of its run you saw a much-bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed, week after week and season after season, as a titan of industry, the for-serious greatest businessman in the world.","Where did so many people originally get the idea that Trump was the right guy to fix our manifestly broken government? Not from Russian bots or targeted social media ad buys, but from a prime-time show that sold itself as real, and sold him as a business genius. Forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders; forget white nationalists and birthers: The core Trump demographic might just have been Republicans who watched “The Apprentice,” who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them.","That was step one in the Trump hack of television media. Step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign. Yes, his fame also boosted him on social media, but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds; with television news there were actual human beings, charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic-minded actors when it suits them, making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to Donald Trump’s rallies, outrages, feuds and personal attacks.","Nothing that Cambridge Analytica did to help the Trump campaign target swing voters (and there’s reason to think it didn’t do as much as it claimed) had anything remotely like the impact of this #alwaysTrump tsunami, which probably added up to more than $2 billion in effective advertising for his campaign during the primary season, a flood that drowned all of his rivals’ pathetic tens of millions. And as cynical as I believe the lords of Silicon Valley to be, the more important cynicism in 2016 belonged to those television execs who were fine with enabling the wild Trumpian takeover of the G.O.P., because after all Republicans deserved it and Hillary was sure to beat him in the end.","Except that she didn’t beat him, in part because he also exploited the polarization that cable news, in particular, is designed to feed. In 2016 this polarization didn’t just mean that Fox became steadily more pro-Trump as he dispatched his G.O.P. rivals; it also meant that a network like CNN, which thrives on Team Red vs. Team Blue conflict, felt compelled to turn airtime over to Trump surrogates like Jeffrey Lord and Corey Lewandowski and Kayleigh McEnany because their regular stable of conservative commentators (I was one of them) simply wasn’t pro-Trump enough.","The depth and breadth of Trump skepticism among right-wing pundits was a pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office. But especially once he won the nomination this skepticism was often filtered out of cable coverage, because the important thing was to maintain the partisan shouting-match model. This in turn encouraged a sense that this was just a typical right-versus-left election, in which you should vote for Trump if you usually voted for Republicans … and in the end that’s what most G.O.P. voters did.","My own CNN experiences were positive; I admire the many fine journalists who work in television news. But it was clear enough being in that orbit in 2016, as it should be clear to anyone who watched Trump’s larger relationship to his television coverage, that the business model of our news channels both assumes and heightens polarization, and that it was ripe for exploitation by a demagogue who was also a celebrity.","It’s also clear — as the economists Levi Boxell, Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro wrote in these pages late last year — that among older white Americans, the core demographic where first the primaries and then the general election were decided, television still far outstrips the internet as the most important source of news. And indeed, the three economists noted, for all the talk about Breitbart’s influence and Russian meddling and dark web advertising, Trump only improved on Mitt Romney’s showing among Americans who don’t use the internet, and he “actually lost support among internet-using voters.” In a sense, you could argue, all those tweets mattered mainly because they kept being quoted on TV.","Which is not to say that the current freakout over Facebook doesn’t make a certain kind of sense. Beyond the psychological satisfaction of weaving the often-genuinely-sinister side of Silicon Valley into stolen-election theories, there’s a strategic wisdom to the center-left establishment’s focus on the internet.","What Trump did will be hard for a future demagogue to imitate: The generations who get their information from newscasts are dying out, the web is taking over at an accelerating pace and in the long run there is more to be gained in going after Mark Zuckerberg than in pillorying Jeff Zucker. And pillorying Fox’s hosts only helps their brand: the big tech companies regard themselves as part of the liberal cultural complex, so they’re vulnerable to progressive bullying and shaming; not so Sean Hannity, whose stalwart support for Trump was and remains vastly more important than any online stratagem.","In the end, as Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote recently for National Review, one implicit goal of the Facebook freakout is to ensure that “conservatives and populists will not be allowed to use the same tools as Democrats and liberals again, or at least not use them effectively.” If the trauma of Trump’s victory turns social-media gatekeepers into more aggressive and self-conscious stewards of the liberal consensus, the current freakout will have more than served its political purpose.","But like the television channels whose programming choices did far more than Facebook to make Donald Trump president, it won’t have served the truth."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

They pose as the traveller and ask for help urgently with the cost of, say, a health problem overseas; since friends and family know the traveller really is in the location cited, they’re more likely to fall for the scam.","As for online attacks, it’s worth reflecting on the nature of the app at the centre of the Cambridge Analytica scandal – a quiz that Facebook users completed for fun but which harvested a range of personal data from them. Similar techniques have been used to harvest data that is then exploited for fraudulent purposes.","For example, an app might ask you to provide your mobile phone number; this could be used to contact premium-rate telephone numbers – you won’t know you’ve been targeted until your bill arrives. In other cases, fraudsters have impersonated well-known brands to launch fake promotions that harvest sensitive data or invite people to change passwords with companies with which they have genuine accounts; this information is then used for fraud.","In other cases, data leaks may be completely out of your control. The consumer credit company Equifax, for example, maintains records of hundreds of millions of people around the world – in the UK, if you’ve ever applied for any kind of credit product, from a mobile phone contract to a mortgage, or if you’re on the electoral roll, the chances are that it will hold some personal data on you. Last year Equifax fell victim to a cyber security attack in which criminals stole the personal information of 145 million people, including 15 million in the UK.","Equifax says most of this data was simply contact information, though in a smaller number of cases email addresses may have been leaked – and even partial records of credit card numbers. It has subsequently written to all those affected warning them to keep a close eye on bank statements and other financial accounts, looking out for unauthorised transactions that the data could have been used to initiate.","In this environment, it is crucial to be as cautious as possible about the data you share online – both the nature of the information and who you make it available to. Don’t sign up to terms and conditions you haven’t read and understood, and be vigilant about your privacy.","New data laws that come into force in May will help with this. They’ll boost your rights to ask for details of all the data held on you by an organisation; they’ll also give you the right to “ask to be forgotten” – to have your data deleted. Be prepared to exercise these rights to keep your data footprint as small and manageable as possible.","Bear in mind that it’s not only crooks you need to look out for. The financial services industry is making increasingly sophisticated use of personal data generated in a whole host of different ways. If you don’t set clear limits about how your data is used, you could be disadvantaged.","It’s not inconceivable, for example, that your health insurer will one day soon have access to data from your supermarket loyalty card – perhaps revealing that your diet puts you at risk of certain health conditions and therefore prompting an increase in your premiums. Or imagine a life insurer refusing to offer you affordable cover after seeing pictures of you engaged in dangerous sports on social media.","In the banking industry, meanwhile, the launch of open banking at the beginning of this year was specifically aimed at encouraging customers to give organisations access to their bank account data. There may be lots of benefits from this – open banking supporters hope innovative companies will launch new services that exploit this data to help people to get better deals or manage their money more effectively. But you can also see how your data could be used against you, both by unscrupulous agents and companies that suddenly know more about you than you might want.","The bottom line is that the Facebook scandal has some very broad lessons. It’s a reminder that our personal data is precious – where we remain in control, willingly sharing information with partners we trust, there may be real benefits. But without vigilance this data could also be our downfall – financially, as well as politically."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and former Trump senior adviser Stephen Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of the investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said that Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked, as well as some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Kogan and Cambridge, and Wylie, that the information he had shared had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to Facebook that they had done so. But Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" the company said. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.\"","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collections have been criticized by other researchers. \"Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows.

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

We were very vocal about that at the time and we addressed it head-on immediately when we realised that it had been put out,\" he told the DCMSC chair Damian Collins.

(Photo by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Concordia Summit)","Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, a company many credited for helping the Trump campaign win the presidential election, from their social media platform Friday.","Here’s why they did it","According to their statement, Facebook claimed that the company violated their policies by using data of their users from a third party.","“We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook,” the statement read. “Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.”","“In 2015,” they continued, “we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe.”","The statement goes on to explain how the data was gathered, which itself was not against their policies:","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But passing that data on to a third party, Cambridge Analytica, violated Facebook’s policies. They said that when they learned about this in 2015, they suspended the app and demanded that all the data be deleted.","Although they were assured the data was destroyed, Facebook says they have reports that this is untrue, and have thereby suspended Cambridge.","Was this data used in the political campaign?","Cambridge Analytica was hired in June 2016 to run the Trump campaign’s data operations. Former Trump aide Steve Bannon had also been a vice president of the firm. It’s unclear as of yet if the data Facebook wanted deleted was used to help Trump win the 2016 campaign.","When some suspected that the company was being investigated for possibly colluding with Russians in the election, they released a statement to Vox. “As one of the companies that played a prominent role in the election campaign, Cambridge Analytica has been asked by the House Intelligence Committee to provide it with information that might help its investigation,” the statement to Vox said.","“We believe that other organizations that worked on the campaign have been asked to do the same. CA is not under investigation, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the company,” it concluded.","Menu","Get TheBlaze Newsletters","Comment Section FAQ","I'm not seeing my post to MyVoice.

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey says her office is launching an investigation into how this happened. She's on the line with us now.","Good morning.","MAURA HEALEY: Good morning.","KING: So Cambridge Analytica says it complied with Facebook's terms of service, that everything it did was aboveboard. What exactly is your investigation looking into?","HEALEY: Well, we're looking into all of this. Look, this is incredibly concerning when you have 50 million Facebook users across this country, across this world who put a lot of information online and relied, essentially, on Facebook to take reasonable steps to prevent the theft and misuse of that information. And so it appears, though we're in early stages in this investigation, that this private profile information was shared without those users knowing, without their consent. And this raises some really serious questions for us.","KING: I guess the thing I still don't understand is what was the potential crime here?","HEALEY: Well, we're looking at this from a variety of perspectives. And that's exactly why we're conducting this investigation. Obviously, there are a lot of questions that we need to have answers to, including how many people's data was shared, what information was shared, what measures were in place to limit the sharing of that information? There are laws in Massachusetts that speak to issues of data privacy and of data breach. And certainly, we're going to be looking at all of that. We're going under - to try to understand exactly what steps Facebook had in place in its operation of this gigantic platform to make sure that data wasn't being misused or misappropriated. And so as I say, we're in early stages, Noel, of this investigation, but I think it's a really important issue.","KING: Don't Facebook users largely accept and understand the risk of this platform being able to share their private data, that it's part of their business model?","HEALEY: Well, I think that most people understand that when we go online and when we participate in a social networking site, we're giving up some rights to privacy. However, the difference here is that this information that was shared doesn't appear to be legitimately obtained. And these are users, remember, who never agreed to have their information exposed in this way. So it's one thing for all of us to sign on to social networking sites. You understand that you are giving up some privacy in that.","But look at the magnitude and scope of this. Look at the degree of this invasion of privacy. Look at the misappropriation of this data. And that's why we're in this investigation. So again, we have a lot of questions that we need answers to. But essentially, this is really concerning because it appears that, really, this is the wild west when it comes to digital privacy, and we need to get a handle on it.","KING: Massachusetts is one of the main tech hubs in the country at this point. Is that why your office, in particular, is moving forward with this investigation?","HEALEY: Well, I think that we have really important relationships with technology companies. They are part of our future. And, you know, in speaking with tech companies, so many of them are very security-minded. And that's important.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)","NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is giving its privacy tools a makeover as it reels from criticisms over its data practices and faces tighter European regulations in the coming months.","The changes won't affect Facebook's privacy policies or the types of data it gathers on users. But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings. Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them.","Wednesday's announcement follows revelations that a President Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing. In addition, Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices.","Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for \"some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.\"","Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details.","The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people. For example, Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page.","Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls. Now, Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place. Facebook says it is also adding \"clearer explanations\" about how its privacy controls work.","Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, called the new settings \"the first of many steps\" the company is taking to address privacy concerns.","Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25. The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data. They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents, no matter where it is based.","To comply with this, Facebook is adding a section called \"access your information,\" a secure way for users to manage data they've shared with the company, including status updates, comments and things they have searched for. That's where people can go to delete information or download a copy. While this download was already possible, it took some time to figure out how to do it. Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail, without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past.","Cox said that while the changes are \"in line with the principle of GDPR,\" there's also a \"bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.\"","ABC7's Lindsey Mastis shows us how to use the new privacy settings on Facebook Live.

{"originalurl":"http://www.nihaobar.com/2018/03/17/ftpyvu2cxqu/","title":"Facebook suspends Cambridge Analytica, the data analysis firm that worked on the Trump campaign - China Business Connect","text":["Facebook suspends Cambridge Analytica, the data analysis firm that worked on the Trump campaign","Facebook announced late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories, and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica — which used Facebook data to target voters for President Donald Trump’s campaign in the 2016 election. In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.”","Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.”","Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information.","Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica either played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential election or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to help disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","…We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","“There’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.”","TechCrunch has reached out to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica with additional questions about the timing of this disclosure and the data’s relationship, if any, to the Trump campaign and will update when we hear back."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

We don’t know what kind of information they wanted.","Perhaps not coincidentally, Yahoo recently said that foreign hackers had obtained millions of user passwords. Such things happen when a company intentionally weakens or bypasses its own cybersecurity measures.","Even more interesting, it appears Yahoo hid the government-directed security breach from its own cybersecurity team. Technology news site Motherboard, citing anonymous former employees, said Yahoo security staff found the scanning tool during a routine checkup.","The company already had a mail scanning system that looked for malware, child pornography, etc. The sources said the U.S. spyware wasn’t simply an addition to that scanner. They described it as a poorly designed, buggy “rootkit.” Executives then told them about the intelligence request.","The engineers were angry, to say the least.

The story reminds me of the government's admission a few years back that Iraq did not, after all, have weapons of mass destruction. By the time it was admitted, everybody had already figured out the emperor was naked. But there was something about the formal acknowledgement that gave us permission to finally wrestle with the reality we had already suspected overwhelmingly.","Those of us who make a habit of dissent have gotten used to this frustrating complacency. It demonstrates that we as a social body don't trust ourselves, that the complex of media, government, academia, and business -- otherwise known as the state -- that proports to lead us can be better described as creating and curating our reality. This insight renders many radicals outright misanthropic, but I tend to approach our apathy sympathetically, regarding our behavior as a kind of learned helplessness inculcated by decades of spiritually arresting mediation. When political expediency necessitates disclosure, we don't know what to do with it, much like paroled prisoners who don't know how to live on the outside.","So when the school assembly is over and the principal has made her announcements, thank God the pundits are there to round us up and lead us back to our homerooms, single file. Our passive consumption of pundits' reactions give us a false sense of agency, as if somehow the variety of spins from which to choose is itself empowering. After all, we don't have time in our busy lives to mentally deal with this, let alone exercise our inherent duty to apprehend it. Better to signal our relevancy by choosing our coping mechanism from a buffet of cynicism, jingoist indignation, reformist compromise, or handwringing resignation.","And so it is with the NSA story. As far as I can tell, we're being provided a number of templates that can help us integrate this newly certified reality into our individual matrices, including:","Mass surveillance is an acceptable encroachment on our privacy.","Mass surveillance requires appropriate oversight or a national conversation to protect our privacy.","Mass surveillance is an unacceptable encroachment on our privacy.","You didn't see it, but you just got jammed. The way we're encouraged to cope with this is to make it about privacy: to turn inwards, take stock of our personal inner domain, and decide just how much of our lives can be offered up to the state. Large scale, bureaucratic intrusion into our personal lives is a given, but we can fill out a customer response card if we have any comments about the degree of the intrusion. If this is about privacy, the onus is on us to define its limits, to guide our servant institutions to the right policies that will protect our newly cordoned-off personal space.","It's in this way that pundits can claim that our ubiquitous sharing on social media validates such large scale, coordinated exploitation. Just like the rape victim was \"asking for it\" because of what she wore at the time of her attack, we're \"asking for it\" because our online sharing habits have been deemed unjudicious. They switch from condemning the aggressor to blaming the victim, and they do it because facing up to the cultural inertia behind the aggression risks exposing the perniciousness of the status quo. And so they invent a clever distraction about what the limits of privacy should be -- as if that were the only limits with which we should be concerned. It's like fighting rape by starting a conversation about the definition of tasteful attire.","Well, let me provide a counterspin that I hope is destablizing: when it comes to this matter, I don't give a goddamn about privacy. It's no more relevant to this story than the big paychecks NSA contractors haul in. Privacy, like fatcat military industrial intelligence complex profiteering, is an important issue without a doubt, but it's not at the center of this matter. The scandal is not about privacy, or whisteblowing, or whether Edward Snowden was a bad neighbor, or whether he had enough education to work within the NSA, or whether the media should have published the story, or the decline of community, or any of that. Anybody who makes the conversation about those issues are welcome to; they should find another room to talk in, though, lest they hijack the real conversation.","This is about state-sponsored spying, not personal privacy. The U.S. government has decided the best, most defensible way to fight whatever it deems threatening (now or in the future) is not to create a dossier on every human being on the planet -- that would be totalitarian! Instead they're merely building the infrastructure that enables them to do so both at will and retroactively. All they're doing is merely collecting anonymous \"metadata\". That's true insofar as it goes (though as a programmer I must protest the abuse of the term \"metadata\", which typicaly refers to \"data about data\", whereas phone numbers, emails, Facebook likes and the like are \"data about us\") but, like most spin, the argument routes around the point with expert precision.","The danger is not so much that government officials are currently investigating you (not that they aren't). It's that if they ever decide they'd like to, they already have your entire history of communication. Normally, an investigation would begin with the gathering of evidence. The cost and effort of beginning to collect evidence is a small and insufficient but important bureaucratic deterrent against starting arbitrary persecutions. However, now an investigation begins with merely bothering to look at the evidence already gathered. Essentially, they started the investigation into you years ago, but it's proceeding on autopilot, waiting for a government spy caring to look.","Imagine, if you will, the NSA claiming the authority to search and catalog the contents of every home on the planet preemptively, but promising never to look at it unless absolutely necessary. The justification is that, in case you're ever accused of a crime in the future, they don't need to assume the burden of getting a warrant or actually searching for what they want to find. They already started it ahead of time, they already have the evidence, and they can just go back and mine that evidence for a crime. Maybe the crime validates the accusation. Maybe along the way they find a totally separate crime. The point is that the investigation is preassembled, a keyword search away from being an actual indictment. If they can create a dossier anytime they want with minimal effort, that's functionally the same as keeping one on you right now.","There's a reason NSA is not in law enforcement: there's nothing limited or legal about the above. It has absolutely, positively zero to do with rights or the law as we understand them. They do what the CIA does to its targets: extralegal gathering of evidence for exploitation at a time of the government's choosing. That is espionage, and there's a reason we abhor it being done to people who are not part of the spy game, let alone people who are supposed to watch over the very government running the spy game.","Yet the most pundits can offer is a shallow, parochial debate about some bourgeois, neutered conception of privacy. For them, this is only about the exact nature of our freedom to share with sufficient insularity pictures of cats, what we had for lunch, and silly memes. Now we need to all sit around indian style and figure out the kind of Stasi with which we'd be most comfortable, what kinds of checks and balances, safeguards and oversight would allow us a good night's monitored sleep.","Don't be fooled. The onus is not on us to properly circumscribe the boundaries of our private lives. The onus is on them to explain the way their leviathan, totalitarian institutions spill out of the confines they agreed to obey, those charters that give them their existence in the first place, the enumerated powers they claim separate them from totalitarian regimes or organized crime syndicates. The lesson here that no pundit will mention is that the state is inherently a scam. This domestic spying on us is but one facet of the overall institutional hegemony that dominates us and teaches us helplessness.","It's understable to feel powerless when massive bureuacracies continually body check your sense of self. If you'd rather ignore the reality of what our world is becoming, fine. But you don't have to accept the turnkey distractions of the punditry. Who knows, one day you may decide that this time they went too far, and if that happens, you'll need a sense of judgment and agency that hasn't completely atrophied."],"isopubdate":""}

The firm claimed it could use “psychographic modeling” from that data that allowed it to identify the personalities of individual voters and influence their behavior.","Since the reports surfaced on Saturday, Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey announced on Twitter that that her office would be launching an investigation into the data leak, linking to the NYT report. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, demanded that Mark Zuckerberg testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions about the leak.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I’ve called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads.

Accept that congressional hearings are a form of theater. And don’t show up as the arrogant jerk from “The Social Network.”","That’s among the advice that crisis communications experts in Washington are offering as Mark Zuckerberg awaits his expected testimony on Capitol Hill about the Cambridge Analytica scandal — the kind of ritual D.C. flogging that is far from his usual comfort zone.","Story Continued Below","“For all his intellect, he’s not a natural communicator,” Bryant Madden, a director in the Washington office of the communications firm Levick, said of the 33-year-old Facebook CEO, who ranks fifth on Forbes' list of the world's richest billionaires. “He’s starting at a deficit, and this is going to be a big challenge for him.”","The stakes couldn't be higher for Facebook, whose stock price has slid more than 16 percent since March 16 amid the ballooning controversy over user privacy, which has spawned investigations by the Federal Trade Commission, dozens of state attorneys general and regulators in Europe. Zuckerberg is expected to testify in the coming weeks before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, one of three congressional panels that have said they want to hear from him.","Zuckerberg, who appeared intensely uncomfortable in a CNN interview last week as he sought to contain the damage, doesn't often stray outside the confines of a tightly controlled media environment. On the Hill, though, he'll have to face finger-wagging members of Congress free to roam off topic and indulge in grandstanding at the CEO's expense.","The most reliable politics newsletter.","Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.","Email","By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.","Besides House Energy and Commerce, the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees have made it clear they want to hear testimony from Zuckerberg, not an underling. He said last week he'd be \"happy\" to testify, with a considerable caveat: only if he's \"the sole authority\" inside Facebook on the topic.","His recent sweep of sometimes-pained interviews after nearly a week of silence in the face of growing questions over Cambridge Analytica shows all the signs of someone who has been given a manual on how to handle harsh questioning — but who hasn’t done the homework exercises, according to communications experts who prepare clients to testify on the Hill.","During the media blitz, Zuckerberg, clad in a crew-neck sweater rather than his favored uniform of gray T-shirt or hoodie, repeated a series of talking points — referring to the Cambridge Analytica situation as a “major breach of trust” again and again — but sometimes stumbled when the questions strayed elsewhere, such as offering a disjointed response when asked to detail his regrets.","“It was obvious to me that he has had a fair amount of coaching, but no practice,” said Alex Conant, former press secretary to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and now a partner at the public affairs consulting firm Firehouse Strategies. \"He was deploying all the normal tricks of media training but without the fluency one gets through practice.\"","Facebook has been under harsh scrutiny since reports emerged more than a week ago that the company allowed Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to the Trump campaign, to get its hands on the records of some 50 million Facebook users. Facebook has confirmed that it knew about the violation in 2015, saying Cambridge Analytica had offered assurances that it had deleted the data — but the social network never verified that the firm had done so.","As a witness in Washington, Zuckerberg would clearly face questioning on that controversy, but lawmakers are likely to roam further afield, asking him about Facebook's role in Russian election interference and Republican claims of Facebook bias against conservative voices.","The CEO will need to develop a new skill set if he's to handle that kind of onslaught. Zuckerberg, despite helming one of the country's biggest tech companies, has never testified before Congress.","The Facebook chief's introductory remarks, experts say, will be his one solid chance to set the terms of the debate over everything from Facebook’s culpability in the Cambridge Analytica affair to what sort of regulations the company would be willing to accept.","“The only modicum of control a witness has at a congressional hearing is their opening statement,” said Mark Harkins, a longtime Hill staffer who's now a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute.","In his interviews last week, Zuckerberg had an earnest take on his potential testimony to Congress. It's not meant to be a \"media opportunity\" but \"to get Congress all the information they need to do their extremely important job,\" he said.","But Harkins said Zuckerberg would be smart to recognize the degree to which a Capitol Hill hearing is political theater.","“A congressional hearing is very similar to a play, but you have to remember the members of Congress are the actors, the congressional staff are stage managers and directors, and the witnesses are the props,\" he said, addingthat the Facebook CEO should try to humanize himself to lawmakers.","“If your only impression of Mark Zuckerberg is 'The Social Network,' that's a problem, because the way he is portrayed in that film is pretty arrogant,\" Harkins added.","Facebook declined to comment on whether Zuckerberg plans to accept the congressional invitations to testify and how he might be preparing.","Zuckerberg would be the latest in a long line of corporate CEOs who've been hauled before Congress amid controversy or upheaval at their companies. Some have fared better than others.","The CEOs of seven major tobacco companies affirmed under oath before a House panel in 1994 that they believed “nicotine is not addictive.” A Justice Department task force briefly considered bringing perjury charges, dropping the idea because the executives were testifying to their opinions.","In 2008, amid the global economic crisis, executives from three of the country’s biggest automobile companies were excoriated by lawmakers for taking private jets to Washington to ask Congress for government bailout funds. Two years later, BP CEO Tony Hayward told an angry congressional committee that he was “deeply sorry” for his company’s role in a massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill. It wasn't enough to quiet calls for his resignation; he stepped down less than six weeks later.","Tech CEOs who have gone before lawmakers have managed to pull off more successful appearances.","When Bill Gates testified in 1998 over concerns that Microsoft was a monopoly, he appeared \"relaxed and earnest\" if at times \"defiant\" as he battled the perception that his company had been \"arrogant and disrespectful\" to regulators, CNET wrote at the time.","Apple CEO Tim Cook answered questions before a congressional panel in 2013 amid criticism his company used a complicated scheme to avoid U.S. taxes. His mild-mannered if unapologetic remarks, delivered with his slight Southern drawl, went some way toward defusing the issue.","\"By the time Mr. Cook walked out, the big cats on a Senate committee were practically eating out of his hand,\" observed The New York Times.","Facebook, for its part, isn't a neophyte when it comes to Capitol Hill.","The social network maintains an extensive lobbying operation in Washington. Zuckerberg himself is also politically active on issues like immigration, serving as the lead backer and public face of the pro-reform group FWD.us that has clashed at times with Trump.","Last year, he embarked on a carefully crafted national tour to meet people from all walks of life, taking him to Iowa and other states and fueling speculation he might have ambitions for high office.","But the CEO has been less present in Washington when it comes to the hot topic of Russian election interference on social media.","In October, the company deployed Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, a former Treasury Department official during the Clinton administration, to meet privately with lawmakers in Washington shortly before a congressional hearing on Russian election meddling.","Lawmakers at that time appeared to accept Facebook, Twitter and Google sending their general counsels to testify about Kremlin meddling on their platforms. But Congress, at this point, seems to have lost patience with dealing with anybody but Silicon Valley's top decision-makers.","\"We believe Mr. Zuckerberg’s testimony is necessary to gain a better understanding of how the company plans to restore lost trust, safeguard users’ data, and end a troubling series of belated responses to serious problems,\" Senate Commerce Committee leaders John Thune (R-S.D.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said as they called for a hearing.","Zuckerberg, should he testify, can draw on ample resources to prepare.","Training would-be witnesses for Capitol Hill appearances is a mini-industry in Washington. Harkins, the Georgetown fellow, teaches a $1,225, two-day class at the university on prepping and delivering testimony, for example.","And the D.C. law firm Venable has a team dedicated to helping clients in “withstanding the scrutiny of Congress.” That practice is led by Bart Stupak, the former chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee — the same panel that’s summoned Zuckerberg.","Madden recommends so-called murder boards, with Zuckerberg doing round after round of tough back-and-forth with public relations experts or even his own staffers playing the role of lawmakers, much like presidential candidates prepare for high-stakes debates.","\"We'd come up with the hardest questions we can come up with and make sure that he's prepared with answers to them,\" Madden said. \"It's experience, experience, experience.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates.","A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information - including the names of users, their \"likes,\" friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work - including a former Cambridge Analytica employee - said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions.","Facebook is suspending the Trump -affiliated data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, after learning that it failed to delete data that it had taken inappropriately from users of the social network, Facebook said late Friday.","Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication...","The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates.","Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what \"like\" buttons they had hit.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning.","Despite Facebook's concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump's digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user-experience researcher, according to Facebook's public website.","Some critics said Facebook's actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump's campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Cambridge Analytica - which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president's former senior adviser Stephen Bannon - has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its \"psychometric profiles\" could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","The company's actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections.","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy, D, said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data \"may have been illegally acquired and used.\"","The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. \"It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\" Denham said in a statement.","Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 EU referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee which is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit group.","Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook's processes for dealing with developers who broke the company's rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules - usually because of a story in the news - the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said.","Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers.","Facebook \"relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,\" Parakilas said. \"During my 16 months at the company, I don't recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.\"","Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.","\"Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook's actions on Saturday, including if they ran afoul of their 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of their agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","In a statement, Facebook said \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry in to U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge's \"psychographic targeting\" techniques - including its use of Facebook data - with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of the Cambridge work.","The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers' likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time.","Cambridge's work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm's data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped.","Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign's data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump's strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.","SCL, Cambridge's parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in \"soft power,\" or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air.","Among its clients: NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russia's influence in the region.","SCL's main offering, first developed by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audience's values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of \"persuadables,\" and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting.","In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCL's defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the company's techniques is that it \"can be undertaken covertly.\"","\"Audience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and government's role and/or third parties can be invisible,\" he wrote."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

He left that position in 2012.\nOn Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”\nHe added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”\nThe FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.\nFacebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.\nIn a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”\nVladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.\n“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.\nThe FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.\nThe FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”\nA key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.\nHundreds of developers — including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns — used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.\nThe data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.\nSuch collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook’s data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.\nVladeck’s view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.\nShe said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”\nRich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.\n“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”\nFacebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.\n“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel in the statement.\nBefore the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.\nThe FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.\nAs a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.\nYears later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.\n“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”\nSome privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.\nThe incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

He has encouraged developers to connect apps and programs to Facebook’s platform.CreditCreditJeff Roberson/Associated Press","In 2007, a young Mark Zuckerberg stood on a stage in San Francisco and announced that Facebook was throwing open its doors.","No longer, he said, would Facebook be a closed-off software product like every other social network. Instead, it would become an open platform and invite outside developers to build apps and programs on top of it.","“We want to make Facebook into something of an operating system,” Mr. Zuckerberg told a reporter.","At the time, the announcement drew little notice outside the programming world. Developers quickly went to work making fun and quirky apps that plugged into Facebook — early hits included “Rendezbook,” a kind of proto-Tinder that allowed users to match with each other for “random flings,” and CampusRank, which allowed college students to nominate their peers for yearbook-type awards.","Later, popular games like FarmVille arrived, and apps like Tinder and Spotify began allowing their users to log in using their Facebook credentials. In some ways, it was a fair trade. Facebook got to weave itself more deeply into users’ internet habits, and the outside app developers got access to a big audience and valuable data about their users. In all, millions of apps have been created with Facebook’s open platform tools.","Through it all, Facebook’s users were mostly unfazed. Sure, these apps collected data about their lives. But they seemed convenient and harmless, and, really, what could go wrong?","Today, more than a decade later, the consequences of Facebook’s laissez-faire approach are becoming clear. Over the weekend, The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm, improperly acquired the private data of about roughly 50 million Facebook users, and used it to target voters on behalf of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.","What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn’t technically a data breach, since this trove of personal information wasn’t stolen from Facebook’s servers. Rather, it was given away freely to the maker of a Facebook personality quiz app called “thisisyourdigitallife.”","That app, which was developed by a University of Cambridge professor, collected data about the 270,000 people who installed it, along with data about their Facebook friends, totaling 50 million people in all. The professor, Aleksandr Kogan, then gave the data he had harvested to Cambridge Analytica.","Technically, only this last step violated Facebook’s rules, which prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third-party app. The rest was business as usual. Third-party apps collect vast amounts of detailed personal information about Facebook users every day, including their ages, location, pages they’ve liked and groups they belong to. Users can opt out of sharing specific pieces of information, but it’s unclear how many do.","This kind of broad data collection is not only allowed but encouraged by Facebook, which wants to keep developers happily building on top of its platform. Permissiveness is a feature, as they say, not a bug.","But in the wake of incidents like the data leak to Cambridge Analytica, some are questioning the costs of such loose policies on an influential platform with 2.2 billion registered users.","“It seems insane that you can make haphazard decisions about so many people’s data,” said Can Duruk, a technology consultant and software engineer. Facebook, he said, was “extremely lax with what kind of data they allowed people to get.”","In a Facebook post on Monday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, admitted that that thinking may have been a mistake.","“We thought that every app could be social,” Mr. Bosworth wrote. “Your calendar should have your events and your friends birthdays, your maps should know where your friends live, your address book should show their pictures. It was a reasonable vision but it didn’t materialize the way we had hoped.”","An early clue about the potential for misuse of Facebook’s third-party developer tools came in 2010 when my colleague Emily Steel, then at The Wall Street Journal, reported that an online tracking company, RapLeaf, was collecting and reselling data it had gathered from third-party Facebook apps to marketing firms and political consultants. In response, Facebook cut off RapLeaf’s data access and said it would “dramatically limit” the misuse of its users’ personal information by outside parties.","But preventing data-hungry developers from exploiting Facebook’s treasure trove of personal information remained challenging. In 2015, Facebook removed the ability of third-party developers to collect detailed information about the friends of users who had installed an app, citing privacy concerns. (Cambridge Analytica’s data trove, which included this type of information, was gathered in 2014, before the change.) Facebook has also taken away tools used by developers to create games and quizzes that barraged users with annoying notifications.","But the core functions of Facebook’s open platform tool are still intact. There are still many third-party apps like “thisisyourdigitallife” out there, vacuuming up intimate data about Facebook users. That data doesn’t disappear, and Facebook has no real recourse to stop it from falling into the wrong hands.","Not all open data access is used irresponsibly. Researchers and nongovernmental organizations have used Facebook’s third-party development tools to respond to natural disasters. And many of the functions that internet users depend on — for example, the ability to import their digital address books into a new messaging app — are possible thanks only to the tools that allow for third-party development known as application programming interfaces, or A.P.I.s.","“Everything we depend on uses A.P.I.s,” said Kin Lane, a software engineer who maintains a website called API Evangelist. “They’re in your home, in your business, in your car. It’s how these platforms innovate and do cool, interesting things.”","In Facebook’s case, permissive data policies were also good for business. Third-party developers built millions of apps on top of Facebook’s platform, giving Facebook users more reasons to spend time on the site and generating more ad revenue for the company. Restricting access to data would limit Facebook’s usefulness to developers and could drive them to build on a rival platform instead, making those products better.","In this context, it’s even less surprising that Dr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were able to use a silly personality quiz to collect information about millions of Americans. After all, why else would the quiz be there?","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: How Did Data Sharing Go From Feature to Bug On Facebook?.

Trump advisor Peter Theil is on Facebook's board, Facebook ads and hoax news stories were key to getting Trump elected, and Facebook has ready-made tools for all the spying that Trump could ask for (and then some).","But as Recode points out, Stamos attended a recent meeting of senior techies who have vowed to resist the use of their tools to help Trump abuse civil and human rights. And as Pando elaborates, Stamos has shown that he's willing to quit his job rather than be complicit in the kinds of abuses we fear from a Trump era.","Loading ...","The Obama administration formalized the Bush practice of arm-twisting tech companies into conducting mass surveillance on the US government's behalf, under seal of secrecy. The Trump presidency will be able to avail itself of these Obama-honed powers, to devastating effect. But it's hard to imagine that even the most abusive Trump DoJ appointees could force Alex Stamos to keep a job he wants to quit. They may be able to swear him to silence, but any sudden resignation from Facebook can be viewed as an indicator that the company has caved to pressure to assist in mass surveillance.","The question is whether Facebook continues to try to keep Trump happy when those requests start rolling in (see also: requests to hire fewer immigrants or, even worse, to share information on those immigrants currently employed.)","In that regard, at least based on past performance, Alex Stamos is someone to whom we should all be paying attention. And in that context the timing of his very public attendance at an anti-Trump meeting looks a lot like a shot across the bows of his own employer.","Should Stamos suddenly get “poached” by another company or decide to leave Facebook for some other unspecified reason, the rest of us should probably take that as a cue to get our data as far away from Mark Zuckerberg’s servers as possible."],"isopubdate":"2017-01-23"}

According to the Financial Times, reporters posed as prospective clients and secretly filmed a series of meetings, including one with the chief executive. The report is due to air this week.","Collins, the chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be recalling Nix to give further testimony to explain why he had told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook.","“We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments,” he said.","Collins will also call on Zuckerberg to testify. He said the company appeared to have previously sent executives who were able to avoid difficult questions and who “claimed not to know the answers”.","The two men may also face a summons from US lawmakers. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Cambridge Analytica to be “thoroughly investigated” and said Facebook must answer questions about how it came to provide private user information to an academic with links to Russia.","The Republican majority on the House intelligence committee announced this week they were winding up their investigation into Russia’s election interference, concluding there was no collusion with Trump’s campaign and, even more controversially, that Moscow did not seek to assist him. Schiff fiercely condemned that decision and said the Democratic minority would continue working on prescriptions for protecting the country in the future.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users, whether it acquired that information illegally and whether it sought to abuse that information in support of President Trump’s political campaign in the United States or Brexit in the United Kingdom,” he told the Guardian.","“The company has repeatedly touted its ability to influence voters through ‘psychographic’ targeting and has claimed it was the fundamental reason that Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Indeed, it may be that through Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign made use of illegitimately acquired data on millions of Americans in order to help sway the election.”","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2m, according to Federal Election Commission records. It denies using any Facebook data in the campaign.","Shortly before the story broke, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer that it was making “false and defamatory” allegations and reserved Facebook’s legal position. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by Cambridge Analytica, working with Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), was a data breach.","It also suspended the whistleblower Chris Wylie from the platform “pending further information” over misuse of data, along with his former employer Cambridge Analytica and its affiliates, and the academic they worked with, Kogan.","The public attack on Wylie came after he had approached the tech company about the data breach, offering to help investigate. He described it as a chilling attack on someone acting in the public interest.","“They acknowledged my offer but then turned around and shot the messenger. I’m trying to make amends for my mistakes and so should Facebook,” he told the Guardian. “Facebook has known about this for at least two years and did almost nothing to fix it. This is not new. And it’s only by coming forward that Facebook is now taking action. People need to know this kind of profiling is happening.”","Collins said his committee wanted more information from Facebook about the circumstances around the breach. “Data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns. Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”","“We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,” Collins said. “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”","Last month, both Facebook representatives and Nix told the parliamentary inquiry into fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data, or any data from GSR.","Play Video","0:25","Cambridge Analytica chief denies working with Facebook data - video","But in its statement on Friday night, explaining why it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, Facebook said it had known in 2015 that profiles were passed to Nix’s company.","“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our ‘platform policies’ by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica,” the statement said.","Collins attacked Facebook for appearing to have been “deliberately avoiding answering straight questions” in testimony to the committee.","“It is now clear that data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns,” Collins said. “Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”","Cambridge Analytica responded to the Observer story on Twitter before Collins had said Nix would be recalled. “We refute(s) these mischaracterizations and false allegations,” it said.","“Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data,” the company said. “When we learned GSR sold us Facebook data that it shouldn’t have done, we deleted it all – system wide audit to verify.”","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.”","Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.”","Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”","Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information.","Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie.","Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica either played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential election or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to help disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails.","In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign).","…We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trump’s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.","The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015.","The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform.","Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena.","“There’s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which we’re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.”","TechCrunch has reached out to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica with additional questions about the timing of this disclosure and the data’s relationship, if any, to the Trump campaign and will update when we hear back."],"isopubdate":""}

Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP","Barack Obama's re-election team are building a vast digital data operation that for the first time combines a unified database on millions of Americans with the power of Facebook to target individual voters to a degree never achieved before.","Digital analysts predict this will be the first election cycle in which Facebook could become a dominant political force. The social media giant has grown exponentially since the last presidential election, rendering it for the first time a major campaigning tool that has the potential to transform friendship into a political weapon.","Facebook is also being seen as a source of invaluable data on voters. The re-election team, Obama for America, will be inviting its supporters to log on to the campaign website via Facebook, thus allowing the campaign to access their personal data and add it to the central data store – the largest, most detailed and potentially most powerful in the history of political campaigns. If 2008 was all about social media, 2012 is destined to become the \"data election\".","\"Facebook is now ubiquitous,\" says Dan Siroker, a former Google digital analyst who joined Obama's campaign in 2008 and now runs his own San Francisco-based analytics consultancy, Optimizely. \"Whichever candidate uses Facebook the most effectively could win the war.\"","For the past nine months a crack team of some of America's top data wonks has occupied an entire floor of the Prudential building in Chicago devising a digital campaign from the bottom up. The team draws much of its style and inspiration from the corporate sector, with its driving ambition to create a vote-garnering machine that is smooth, unobtrusive and ruthlessly efficient.","Already more than 100 geeks, some recruited at top-flight university job fairs including Stanford, are assembled in the Prudential drawn from an array of disciplines: statisticians, predictive modellers, data mining experts, mathematicians, software engineers, bloggers, internet advertising experts and online organisers.","At the core is a single beating heart – a unified computer database that gathers and refines information on millions of committed and potential Obama voters. The database will allow staff and volunteers at all levels of the campaign – from the top strategists answering directly to Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina to the lowliest canvasser on the doorsteps of Ohio – to unlock knowledge about individual voters and use it to target personalised messages that they hope will mobilise voters where it counts most.","Every time an individual volunteers to help out – for instance by offering to host a fundraising party for the president – he or she will be asked to log onto the re-election website with their Facebook credentials. That in turn will engage Facebook Connect, the digital interface that shares a user's personal information with a third party.","Consciously or otherwise, the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they store publicly on their Facebook page – home location, date of birth, interests and, crucially, network of friends – directly into the central Obama database.","\"If you log in with Facebook, now the campaign has connected you with all your relationships,\" a digital campaign organiser who has worked on behalf of Obama says.","The potential benefits of the strategy can already be felt. The Obama campaign this year has attracted about 1.3 million donors, 98% of whom have contributed $250 or less – that's more than double the number at the same stage in 2008. At this rate, Obama is also well on the way towards staging the world's first billion-dollar campaign.","Under its motto \"Bigger, better, 2012\", the Chicago team intends between now and election day in November to create a campaign powerhouse which will allow fundraisers, advertisers and state and local organisers to draw from the same data source.","Joe Rospars, the campaign's chief digital strategist, told a seminar at the Guardian-sponsored Social Media Week that the aim was to create technology that encourages voters to get involved, in tune with Obama's emphasis on community organising.","Campaign insiders say that the emphasis this year will be on efficiency more than any headline-grabbing technical wizardry. But that should not obscure how significant this year's presidential cycle will be in putting to the test the first custom-made digital campaign.","Mark Sullivan, founder of Voter Activation Network, which manages the Democratic party's central database of voter information known as Vote Builder, says that \"what we will see in 2012 will make 2008 look really primitive\".","Judith Freeman of New Organizing Institute, who worked on both John Kerry's 2004 and Obama's 2008 presidential campaigns, says there is a leap forward in technology every presidential cycle, and 2012 would be no exception. \"There's a deadline – it's got to be done by election day – and that provides a huge push to make things happen.\"","In 2008 the Obama digital team was lauded around the world for its groundbreaking work on internet fundraising. Yet in fact, the separation of its data on voters into several distinct silos forced high-level staffers to spend hours manually downloading information from one database to another.","The Obama team in 2008 did a good job in beginning to tear down those walls, releasing extraordinary fundraising energy in the process that raised about $500m online.","This year the Chicago team hasn't knocked down the walls so much as dispensed with them altogether. They have built from the ground up a unified database that incorporates and connects everything the campaign knows about a voter within it.","Rospars said that in 2012 they no longer had to try to integrate data in the campaign. \"We are just one campaign now – we built it from scratch.\"","The centralised nature of the database may raise privacy issues as the election cycle progresses. Jeff Chester of the digital advertising watchdog Center for Digital Democracy, which has been calling for regulators to review the growth of digital marketing in politics, said that \"this is beyond J Edgar Hoover's dream. In its rush to exploit the power of digital data to win re-election, the Obama campaign appears to be ignoring the ethical and moral implications.\"","But from the vantage point of the campaign the benefits are evident.","\"Fusing your data into one central store is cheaper, quicker and allows you to be more targeted,\" said Jim Pugh, who was part of Obama's 2008 digital team and now works for the progressive online movement, Rebuild the Dream.","The Obama database incorporates Vote Builder, a store of essential information such as age, postal address, occupation and voting history drawn from the voter files of 190 million active voters. It lines up and matches those voter files with data gathered from online interactions with the president's supporters – notably the millions of pieces of information its army of canvassers collected across the nation during the 2008 race, a list of email addresses of supporters that it has amassed and that now stands at about 23 million, as well as the contact information of Obama's 25 million Facebook fans.","Facebook itself has been transformed as a political campaign tool since 2008, simply by dint of its exponential growth. Four years ago there were about 40 million Facebook users in the US; now there are more than 160 million – incorporating almost the entire voting public.","The significance of the fusion of Facebook and voter file data is hard to overemphasise. \"This is the Moneyball moment for politics,\" says Sam Graham-Felsen, Obama's chief blogger in 2008. \"If you can figure out how to leverage the power of friendship, that opens up incredible possibilities.\"","First among those possibilities is that the campaign can distribute customised content designed specifically for its Facebook fans to share with their much wider circle of friends. The messages can be honed to a particular demographic – age, gender, etc – as well as set of interests, and targeted on the most hotly contested parts of the most crucial battleground states.","\"Influencers\" – those people who tend to act as thought leaders among their friends on Facebook – can be identified and prioritised.","Teddy Goff, the digital director of the re-election team, told Social Media Week that as the year progresses there would be more and more \"persuasion through interaction\".","Individual voters would be given access to digital platforms from which they will be able to tell their own stories \"and that's far more powerful than anything we can say\", Goff said. \"That will be the story of this election. People's own stories really moves votes.\"","Goff said the campaign was focused on building relationships through social media. An Obama message would be crafted so that \"not only can it be passed to your friends but to those friends that we think are most in need of passing it on to\".","The bottom line is that if you are sent a message from your Facebook friend encouraging you to turn up to an event or donate to Obama, you are vastly more likely to respond than if the request comes from an anonymous campaign staffer.","The other door that data integration will further open in 2012 is personalised marketing. This has been the Holy Grail of political campaigners for decades: the idea that you can talk directly to voters and serve them customised messages.","In the old world of snail mail, that could be achieved to some degree through direct marketing – ie leaflets dropped into the letter box – but that is expensive and far too slow with today's 24-hour news cycle.","The fusion of information into a centralised database allows you to direct market online at much less cost and virtually instantaneously.","The technique has begun to spread widely among commercial businesses over the past year, and it is only a matter of time before such hyper-targeting is standard across political campaigns. Indeed, we've already started to see it this year.","The Obama campaign has already tailored a single donation request to 26 distinct segments of the voting public. The Republicans are also getting in on the act.","Michele Bachmann used customised online advertising in Iowa to reach Republican voters only, sending to their computers messages with a local spin for each of the state's 99 counties. That helped her win Iowa's vaunted straw poll in August 2011 (though that didn't help her in the long run). Rick Perry sent God-praising commercials to Iowans who listed themselves as evangelicals on Facebook.","The company CampaignGrid, that serves mainly Republican candidates, claims to be able to online market direct to targeted households. It has an integrated database on 110 million voters across America – some 65% of the electorate – to whom it can serve personalised ads, following them wherever they are browsing on the internet.","Jeff Dittus, the company's co-founder, illustrates what this means. He worked on behalf of one unidentified Republican presidential candidate, serving online ads in the Miami-Dade region of Florida specifically to 400,000 individuals who had voted in at least two of the four previous Republican primaries. The adverts were further customised for gender, and for Spanish speaking.","They were distributed to the individuals through internet ad exchanges that allow for instantaneous filtering of users the nanosecond they click onto a video on any one of four million websites. In that flash, if you fitted the criterion you were served with a 30-second pre-roll video from the candidate delivering a message to you that you would have found remarkably personal.","\"I'm sure this is the future of digital political campaigning,\" said CampaignGrid's CEO Jeff Dittus.","Drew Brighton, CEO of TargetSmart Communications, is hoping to do the same hyper-targeting for Democratic and progressive politicians and causes through his new product Target Blue. It matches up the details of up to 50m cookies embedded on individual computers with voter files and uses it to identify Democratic-leaning individuals to whom it can serve customised ads wherever they go on the web.","The company is also developing a system for targeting Democratic voters through their computer IP addresses down to such tightly drawn areas or \"IP zones\" as just 20 households. That allows for micro-targeting depending on the average income bracket, age profile and concerns of that tiny locality.","The elephant in the room, of course, is television, which continues to dominate advertising spending by political campaigns. Most analysts agree that 2012 has come too soon for any equally transformative leaps forward in targeted or \"addressable\" TV advertising.","Cable television can close in on geographic zones ranging from a few thousand to up to 100,000 viewers allowing campaigns to shape their messages to those clusters. The tighter the geographical area that can be drawn, the more efficient the TV advertising becomes as campaign managers can focus on primarily-Democratic, Republican or independent neighbourhoods.","But its still a relatively blunt instrument. The prize would be to be able to fuse cable subscriptions with voter files so that TV adverts could be sent to households of a specific political persuasion.","Technically, that's already possible. Comcast Spotlight, the advertising arm of Comcast Cable, has run trials of commercial as opposed to political addressable advertising in Baltimore. Adverts custom-made to speak to various demographic groups were piped into 60,000 identified households, though the personal details were removed to protect privacy. The results confirmed the power of the technology: homes receiving addressable adverts tuned away a third less of the time than homes receiving untargeted commercials.","Dan Sinagoga, who specialises in political advertising at Comcast Spotlight, says that all advertisers, but political ones in particular, \"would like to be doing addressable advertising yesterday\". But he said it was unlikely to happen in any great quantity in 2012 as there are too many hurdles, including concerns in Washington about the privacy of cable TV consumers.","No such impediment will hold back the digital explosion this year. As an Obama insider puts it: \"Give us less wood, and we'll make more fire.\""],"isopubdate":"2012-02-17"}

That will help us determine possible next steps.”","The social network giant saw its stock plummet 6.8 per cent on Monday after reports of misuse of its users’ data by Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that helped Donald Trump’s campaign profile voters during the 2016 presidential race.","The New York Times and The Observer of London reported the firm bought information on 50 million user profiles from a University of Cambridge professor who harvested the data with a personality quiz. The professor obtained the information legally, but allegedly violated Facebook rules by selling it to Cambridge Analytica. The firm never obtained the users’ consent to use their data, nor did Facebook alert users when it found out Cambridge had their information, according to a whistleblower.","The U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office has launched an investigation into the matter. Canada’s privacy office said it will assist as appropriate.","“Ultimately, our goal is to ensure that the privacy rights of Canadian Facebook users are protected,” Therrien said.","The case raises questions about how Facebook protects and monitors consumer data, and whether users can trust third parties not to compromise their privacy. It’s not clear whether this is an isolated case.","Chantal Bernier, a global privacy and cybersecurity lawyer at Dentons and former interim privacy commissioner, said she believes such activity likely happens all over the place, including in Canada.","“This is certainly a wake-up call,” Bernier said in an interview. “This whole incident shows the disempowerment of the user in front of the organizations that collect the data.”","People often don’t understand what they’re consenting to when they click “I agree,” she said. Plus, there is limited accountability for companies that do break the rules. The privacy commissioner has limited powers to audit companies and no power to impose financial penalties.","“Personal information is extremely valuable, and therefore the misuse should be met with penalties that are proportionate to that value,” she said.","Still, public privacy breaches can come with a high cost. The stock market erased billions of dollars from Facebook’s value in response to the reports.","“What has become very clear to business is that it is now a competitive advantage to be privacy-protected,” she said.","In Canada, private businesses must obey the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). It requires consent for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information for commercial activities. Under the law, companies are accountable for the management and safekeeping of that information.","PIPEDA, however, does not apply to political parties. In 2016, the privacy commissioner asked Parliament to consider regulating how political parties use personal information.","Kris Klein, a privacy lawyer at nNovation, called on Parliament to make national political parties follow the same rules as other organizations as politics enters the Big Data game.","“We have just scratched the surface when it comes to data mining technologies so these issues are just going to get bigger and, perhaps even more scandalous,” Klein said in an email.","“I hope our lawmakers wake up and realize we’re fully into the information age and Canadians deserve the best protection possible when it comes to safeguarding our personal information.”","This Week's Flyers","Comments","We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Eric\n*********************************\nNotes for a 2016 Democratic Campaign\nEric Schmidt\nApril 2014\nDRAFT DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT\nHere are some comments and observations based on what we saw in the 2012\ncampaign. If we get started soon, we will be in a very strong position to\nexecute well for 2016.\n1. Size, Structure and Timing\nLets assume a total budget of about $1.5Billion, with more than 5000 paid\nemployees and million(s) of volunteers. The entire startup ceases\noperation four days after November 8, 2016. The structure includes a\nChairman or Chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and a\nPresident who is the executive in charge of objectives, measurements,\nsystems and building and managing the organization.\nEvery day matters as our end date does not change. An official campaign\nright after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best.\n2. Location\nThe campaign headquarters will have about a thousand people, mostly young\nand hardworking and enthusiastic. Its important to have a very large\nhiring pool (such as Chicago or NYC) from which to choose enthusiastic,\nsmart and low paid permanent employees. DC is a poor choice as its full of\ndistractions and interruptions. Moving the location from DC elsewhere\nguarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help.\nThe key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work for\nyou. Any outer borough of NYC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston are all good\nexamples of a large, blue state city to base in.\nEmployees will relocate to participate in the campaign, and will find low\ncost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis.\nThis worked well in Chicago and can work elsewhere.\nThe computers will be in the cloud and most likely on Amazon Web services\n(AWS). All the campaign needs are portable computers, tablets and smart\nphones along with credit card readers.\n3. The pieces of a Campaign\na) The Field\nIts important to have strong field leadership, with autonomy and\nempowerment. Operations talent needs to build the offices, set up the\nsystems, hire the people, and administer what is about 5000 people.\nInitial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states.\nThere is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the human\nsystems. The field is about organizing people, voter contact, and get out\nthe vote programs.\nFor organizing tools, build a simple way to link people and activities as a\nworkflow and let the field manage the system, all cloud based. Build a\nsimple organizing tool with a functioning back-end. Avoid deep integration\nas the benefits are not worth it. Build on the cloud. Organizing is\nreally about sharing and linking people, and this tool would measure and\ntrack all of it.\nThere are many other crucial early investments needed in the field:\ndetermining the precise list of battleground states, doing early polling to\nconfirm initial biases, and maintaining and extending voter protection\nprograms at the state level.\nb) The Voter\nKey is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all\nthat is known about them. In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify,\nmeet, and update profiles on the voter. A dynamic volunteer can easily\nspeak with a voter and, with their email or other digital handle, get the\nvoter videos and other answers to areas they care about (\"the benefits of\nACA to you\" etc.)\nThe scenario includes a volunteer on a walk list, encountering a potential\nvoter, updating the records real time and deepening contact with the voter\nand the information we have to offer.\nc) Digital\nA large group of campaign employees will use digital marketing methods to\nconnect to voters, to offer information, to use social networks to spread\ngood news, and to raise money. Partners like Blue State Digital will do\nmuch of the fund raising. A key point is to convert BSD and other partners\nto pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load.\nd) Media (paid), (earned) and (social), and polling\nNew tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of paid, earned\nand social media. The impact of press coverage should be measurable in\nreach and impact, and TV effectiveness measured by attention and other\nsurveys.\nBuild tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and rumors, and\nmodel how it works and who has the biggest impact. Tools can tell us about\nthe origin of stories and the impact of any venue, person or theme.\nConnect polling into this in some way.\nFind a way to do polling online and not on phones.\ne) Analytics and data science and modeling, polling and resource\noptimization tools\nFor each voter, a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote.\nAnalytics can model demographics, social factors and many other attributes\nof the needed voters. Modeling will tell us what who we need to turn out\nand why, and studies of effectiveness will let us know what approaches work\nwell. Machine intelligence across the data should identify the most\nimportant factors for turnout, and preference.\nIt should be possible to link the voter records in Van with upcoming\ndatabases from companies like Comcast and others for media measurement\npurposes.\nThe analytics tools can be built in house or partnered with a set of\nvendors.\nf) Core engineering, voter database and contact with voters online\nThe database of voters (NGP Van) is a fine starting point for voter records\nand is maintained by the vendor (and needs to be converted to the cloud).\nThe code developed for 2012 (Narwahl etc.) is unlikely to be used, and\nreplaced by a model where the vendor data is kept in the Van database and\nintermediate databases are arranged with additional information for a voter.\nQuite a bit of software is to be developed to match digital identities with\nthe actual voter file with high confidence. The key unit of the campaign\nis a \"voter\", and each and every record is viewable and updatable by\nvolunteers in search of more accurate information.\nIn the case where we can't identify the specific human, we can still have a\npartial digital voter id, for a person or \"probable-person\" with attributes\nthat we can identify and use to target. As they respond we can eventually\nmatch to a registered voter in the main file. This digital key is\neventually matched to a real person.\nThe Rules\nIts important that all the player in the campaign work at cost and there be\nno special interests in the financing structure. This means that all\nvendors work at cost and there is a separate auditing function to ensure no\none is profiting unfairly from the campaign. All investments and conflicts\nof interest would have to be publicly disclosed. The rules of the audit\nshould include caps on individual salaries and no investor profits from the\ncampaign function. (For example, this rule would apply to me.)\nThe KEY things\na) early build of an integrated development team and recognition that this\nis an entire system that has to be managed as such\nb) decisions to exclusively use cloud solutions for scalability, and choice\nof vendors and any software from 2012 that will be reused.\nc) the role of the smart phone in the hands of a volunteer. The smart\nphone manages the process, updates the database, informs the citizen, and\nallows fundraising and recruitment of volunteers (on android and iphone).\nd) early and continued focus of qualifying fundraising dollars to build the\nfield, and build all the tools. Outside money will be plentiful and\nperfect for TV use. A smart media mix tool tells all we need to know about\nmedia placement, TV versus other media and digital media."],"isopubdate":""}

I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.\"","Stamos advocated investigating and revealing manipulation of news at the social network by Russian entities, to the chagrin of chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and other top executives, the Times reported, citing unnamed current and former employees.","Stamos reportedly decided in December he was done with Facebook, but remained at the social network as part of a plan to smoothly hand his job off to a successor. Neither Facebook nor Stamos directly commented on how long he intended to remain at the company, referring to his tweet in response to queries.","Word from Stamos came as the California-based social media giant faced an onslaught of criticism at home and abroad over revelations that a firm working for Donald Trump's presidential campaign harvested and misused data on 50 million members.","Calls for investigations came on both sides of the Atlantic after Facebook responded to the explosive reports of misuse of its data by suspending the account of Cambridge Analytica, a British firm hired by Trump's 2016 campaign.","Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, called the revelations \"horrifying, if confirmed,\" and vowed to address concerns in the United States this week.","In Britain, parliamentary committee chair Damian Collins said both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook had questions to answer.","According to a joint investigation by the Times and Britain's Observer, Cambridge Analytica was able to create psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users through a personality prediction app downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up data from friends.","Facebook said it had hired a digital forensics firm to examine how the data leak occurred and to ensure that any data collected had been destroyed.","An undercover investigation of Cambridge Analytica by Britain's Channel 4 found executives boasted they could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and Ukrainian sex workers, and spread misinformation online.","The executives claimed to have worked in more 200 elections across the world, including Argentina, the Czech Republic, India, Kenya and Nigeria.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale.

From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014.

Unless users had their Facebook privacy settings locked down the app slurped not only the 270,000 consenting users but all their friends as well - over 50 million people according to Christopher Wylie, a former researcher director at CA, who had a copy of the data set.","Facebook is peeved that the data was collected under an academic license and then sold commercially. Dr Kogan has no comment at time of publication, but CA has said it was misled about the data’s legality under British law when it worked with Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR) in 2014.","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” CA said in a statement.","“No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Facebook knew about the incident in 2015 and sought assurances from all concerned that the data had been deleted. What has prompted Friday’s suspension of Cambridge Analytica was Wylie going public to various media outlets with some extraordinary claims about how the data was used.","Down the rabbit hole","According to Wylie the Facebook data was used to build up detailed profiles of the social and political views of around 30 million US voters. Once their preferences had been cataloged, Cambridge Analytica determined what types of emotional and visual messages would sway their views and then spammed their social media fields with professionally produced, carefully crafted misinformation.","Wylie was an early employee of Cambridge Analytica and claims the firm’s flamboyant old-Etonian CEO Alexander Nix sold former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon on the technology. The way Wylie tells it, Bannon, who at the time was editor of the right-wing website Breitbart, wanted to use Cambridge Analytica’s technology to change the very culture of America.","“Steve wanted weapons for his culture war,” Wylie told The Observer. “We offered him a way to accomplish what he wanted to do which was change the culture of America.” You can see the full interview below:","Bannon needed money to do this, and Wylie claims it came from Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund manager and former IBM fellow who is known for throwing millions in funding at right-wing causes, including Breitbart.","Wylie claims he and Nix travelled to pitch Mercer on the plan in New York and sold him on the idea. Mercer pumped US$15m into Cambridge Analytica, Bannon became the company's vice president, and Nix celebrated by slicing the top off a champagne bottle with a sabre that he keeps in the office, Wylie said.","There was only one problem - the software didn’t work. So Cambridge Analytica, in the time honored tradition of Bill Gates’ first IBM operating system, went out and bought better software for peanuts. Documents Wylie took with him after he left the company in mid-2014 show it paid GSR a little under £1m ($1.39m) for the data and the means to use it.","“What Kogan offered us was way cheaper, way faster, and of a quality that nothing matched,” he said. In a few months the profiles of over 50 million Facebook users had been slurped and fed into Cambridge Analytica’s new and improved algorithms. “I was naive and made a big mistake\", Wylie said.","Last month Nix denied Cambridge Analytica had ever used Facebook data for political purposes to the UK's Culture Media and Sport select committee. Wylie claims this was a lie and while it wasn’t explicitly stated, everyone at CA knew where the data had come from.","“It was an instance of If you don’t ask questions then you won’t get an answer that you don’t like,” he said.","In light of Wylie’s claims the UK Information Commissioner's Office has announced that it will open an investigation into the affair. CA is already being quizzed as to its involvement in Britain's Brexit referendum, so it looks like Nix will be back to Parliament soon for another grilling.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham.","“We are continuing to invoke all of our powers and are pursuing a number of live lines of inquiry. Any criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously\".","Wylie said he quit the company in mid-2014, telling Channel 4 News “I don’t want to work for the alt-right.”","He set up a similar firm called Eunoia Technologies to do more ethical marketing, taking a copy of the data with him, and has since had legal issues with CA But he insisted he wasn’t out for revenge.","Mr. Wylie is a former contractor for, not a founder of CA. He is the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent misuse of the company's intellectual property. 4/8","“If it was revenge I could have done this years ago,” he said. And if I wanted to recreate Cambridge Analytica I should have just stayed. But I didn’t, I chose to leave.”","You can watch the full interview, complete with somewhat cliched shots of Wylie using a laptop on an artfully lit pavement and looking moody, here:","He claims to have deleted the data before being formally asked to do so by Facebook in 2016, a year after the misuse was discovered by the social media firm. All he had to do was fill in a form saying he had deleted and Facebook were satisfied with that.","It’s not a data breach - it’s a feature","On Saturday morning Facebook updated its statement on the matter with the following missive:","The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","On social media the company's head of security Alex Stamos has been taking to Twitter to make the same point. He pointed out that users now have controls in their privacy settings to block just this kind of data slurping. However, he has now deleted those tweets.","I'm going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","According to Tiffany Li, research fellow at Yale and the Wikimedia/Yale Law School Initiative on Intermediaries and Information, Facebook might be liable in the courts but appears to be positioning itself as a wronged party in the affair.","“Facebook alluded to fraud in the statement and they could be implying that they were defrauded, and that either the academic or Cambridge Analytica misrepresented itself to Facebook,” she told The Register.","“Facebook itself may have some liability. There are contractual agreements in its privacy policy, but it faces the possibility of Federal Trade Commission enforcement if found to be seriously at fault.”","People in Facebook familiar with the matter told The Register that the company’s primary concern is that this is a matter of a researcher misusing data fraudulently. All options in whether to take further action against those involved are being considered.","The case may, however, have longer-term implications for how States regulate data within their borders, Li said. It was clear that technology companies are trying to be more responsible with their data, but new legislation is needed, since we’re largely still operating under laws written pre-internet.","+Comment","Mr Wylie’s extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and so far we only have his word.","The usefulness of Cambridge Analytica’s technology has been called into question by academics who say its ability to pinpoint voters is in question. There’s also the question of CA’s record.","If the company's targeting and propaganda arm is so powerful then why isn’t the company an international kingmaker? Presidential hopeful Senator Ted Cruz hired the firm to improve his image and Nix reportedly bragged that Cambridge Analytica had turned “one of the less-popular” candidates into the “second-most threatening contender.”","But he still lost, and lost big time. That may be a bad metric because Cruz is loathed by many in his own party, but Cambridge Analytica should be being bought into by every political party in the world if it can swing over voters as effectively as has been claimed.","Cambridge Analytica did work for Trump in the last five months or so of his campaign. Whether or not they had an effect is hard to tell. Facebook’s own research shows that its feeds can affect people’s emotions, but can it do the same for voting patterns?","But does it have an effect? Almost certainly - all successful firms like this, from Palantir on down, sell services like this and people wouldn’t pay for them if they didn’t work. We all have a responsibility to be skeptical about what social media is feeding us.","Facebook and Cambridge Analytica will certainly be under the microscope. The Massachusetts Attorney General has announced the state will hold an investigation into the matter immediately.","There’s also the Robert Mueller investigation to consider. He has reportedly already had contact with Cambridge Analytica, and the former FBI boss will be looking to get to the bottom of such things.","But it's likely that a copy, or copies, of the archive is still out there, given that Facebook demands nothing more than a pinky swear from those responsible that they really did delete it. Finding such a data trove would put Cambridge Analytica in very hot water indeed.","Incidentally, if you want to know what data Cambridge Analytica has on you then finding out is simple. Under UK data protection laws the company has to tell you what it has on its servers and you simply have to ask for it. There are more details here and feel free to get in touch if anything interesting pops up. ®"],"isopubdate":""}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

You might want to read this.","In a post from Ars Technica that has clearly rattled some chains over at Facebook central, it's been revealed that Facebook can track phone call logs, text message dates and times, and contacts from Android phones.","Ahem. Let me restate that to make it absolutely clear: Facebook tracked your phone call dates and times, logs of when you messaged people, and actual contact numbers with names.","Why, exactly, this information is tracked is part of the company's marketing witches brew, perhaps related to selling those bits of data to folks like Cambridge Analytica, which collected information on 50 million Facebook users before the last U.S. presidential election in an effort to help paying clients win.","Another reason Facebook keeps that data is because it uses that contact information to make friend recommendations on its site. If you've ever wondered why your ex's friends, your hairdresser or your psychologist shows up as a friend suggestion, there you have it.","In response to an email inquiry by Ars Technica about this data gathering, a Facebook spokesperson stated, \"The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.\"","Infographics show the classes and anxieties in the supposedly classless U.S. economy.","For those of us who follow politics, we’re used to commentators referring to the President’s low approval rating as a surprise given the U.S.'s “booming” economy. This seeming disconnect, however, should really prompt us to reconsider the measurements by which we assess the health of an economy. With a robust U.S. stock market and GDP and low unemployment figures, it’s easy to see why some think all is well. But looking at real U.S. wages, which have remained stagnant—and have, thus, in effect gone down given rising costs from inflation—a very different picture emerges. For the 1%, the economy is booming. For the rest of us, it’s hard to even know where we stand. A recent study by Porch (a home-improvement company) of blue-collar vs. white-collar workers shows how traditional categories are becoming less distinct—the study references \"new-collar\" workers, who require technical certifications but not college degrees.

The result could be a hearing that exposes both of those tech giants – whose data is not known to have been taken by Cambridge Analytica – to uncomfortable questions about the extent to which they profit from their users’ most personal data, too.","A spokesman for Zuckerberg, who last week expressed his openness to appear at a hearing, said Facebook is still reviewing the request. A spokeswoman for Twitter declined comment. Spokespeople for Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The Senate’s upcoming hearing is hardly the only major political and legal challenge facing Facebook. Earlier Monday, a powerful U.S. watchdog agency, the Federal Trade Commission, said it would investigate Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica incident. The news initially sent Facebook’s stock price tumbling, though it reversed those losses by the end of the day as the market surged.","For the U.S. government, a key question is whether Facebook's business practices violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over another privacy mishap. As a result, the new probe carries the potential for steep fines and other penalties on the social giant, which is facing similar investigations in Europe.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” Tom Pahl, the acting director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement Monday. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","For its part, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Friday that it had obtained data from the social network “in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws.\"","On Capitol Hill, lawmakers on two panels -- the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee – already have invited Zuckerberg to testify at two upcoming hearings. But lawmakers have not indicated if they would seek to subpoena the Facebook executive if he declined to attend or sought to send another company official in his place.","The Senate Judiciary Committee panel, however, could prove to be the toughest political territory for Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers. Lawmakers there have been seething over Facebook, Google and Twitter since last fall, when the panel grilled those tech giants’ lawyers about another issue – Russian propaganda that spread on their platforms around the 2016 election.","Questions about Trump, the Russian government’s disinformation efforts and the presidential race are likely to return at the scheduled April 10 session – on top of new, uncomfortable queries about the ways that the biggest brands in the tech industry collect and protect information about their users. Some of the Judiciary Committee’s members, including Republican Sen. John Kennedy (La.) and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), are regular critics of the tech industry’s privacy practices.","On Monday, Blumenthal said that federal officials investigating Facebook should be “penetrating and prompt in holding [it] accountable for apparent illegal action.” He even suggested in a statement that “possible remedies should include damage payments to users, and other court-ordered action.”","For now, the Senate Judiciary Committee session is set to “broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” the committee announced Monday. “It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Tony RommTony Romm is a technology policy reporter at The Washington Post.

Keeping those records “helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provide you with a better experience across Facebook,” says the blog.","FacebookThe screen on Facebook Messenger for Android that prompts you to upload your call history.","It also says that the data is not sold to any third party, and that Facebook doesn’t read your texts or listen to your phone calls. Besides, says Facebook, it’s not crazy to ask for access to your contacts: “Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and services as a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with.”","However, the Ars Technica report gives a little more reason for Android users to worry.","Until Google instituted some changes in October 2017, allowing an app to access your contacts could also give it access to the kinds of call and text records in question in this matter. According to the report, all of the call and text records end in October 2017 – which suggests, but does not prove, that the main Facebook app for Android was taking advantage of that method to get the data.","Still, Facebook maintains that this has always been an opt-in feature, and that users would have been prompted.","Also of note is that Apple’s iOS, the operating system on the iPhone and iPad, doesn’t allow that kind of access to call and text data at all without very specific permission. That means Apple fans don’t have to worry as much about Facebook having call or text records.","Facebook provides a tool to see which contacts have been uploaded to Messenger, which you can get to here. But it’s a good reminder – if you’re really concerned about online privacy, think twice about uploading your address book."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The good news is that it already exists.","There’s a massive elephant in the room, and the problem is far bigger than Facebook. It's capitalism, and how it manifests itself on the internet.","The solution? A socialist internet - in which the internet is a tool for common good rather than a vehicle for profit.","Guess what? That internet already exists.","Let's be clear on what the fuss is about. An external researcher harvested the personal details of 50 million Facebook users by getting them to use a \"personality app\".","He then gave the data to a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, without getting the consent of the users.","Cambridge Analytica has bragged about it’s role in the Trump campaign and was involved in the Brexit campaign – and the concern is that Facebook data may have been used to support these victories.","What we should be equally worried about is that Facebook already has the data of not just those 50 million users, but of all more than 2 billion active users, and in far greater detail.","They know who most of your friends and acquaintances are, how often you interact with them, what your likes, dislikes, hobbies and work interests are, where you live, where you travel, what your face looks like, your contact information, your phone and laptop model, your internet service provider (ISP), which websites you visit and much more.","We willingly give our private data to Facebook, and give Facebook the consent to use it to earn its annual net income of almost US $16 billion.","Without our consent, Facebook has also (willingly or unwillingly) shared large amounts of our data with government bodies such as the US National Security Agency.","Of course, none of this information is new, but it should make us realise that the Cambridge Analytica scandal is probably the least of our problems when it comes to privacy.","Facebook is just a symptom of a larger disease","The #DeleteFacebook campaign makes it seem like Facebook is an isolated case of an online business that has overstepped its boundaries.","However, most of us should be well aware by now that the problem isn't that of Facebook alone, but it is the business model shared by most internet behemoths controlling the most valuable online real estate, in which we are not the customers, but the commodity.","Facebook and other social media sites sell our eyeballs to advertisers so that we can buy their products. That istheir business model.","This business model is novel in some ways, but in essence it is not different from traditional ad-based media. They give us free content to consume, and then sell some of our attention to businesses wanting to sell us things.","The key difference, as far as privacy is concerned, is that the internet allows the businesses to know far more about our personal lives and preferences than was the case for traditional media.","For example, a commercial radio station trying to sell an ad spot to an advertiser would only be able to provide the broad generalised demographics and preferences of its listeners, not the personal and granular details that Facebook offers. But if that radio station could do what Facebook can, then it would, because that is the model of success that we idealise – and it's called capitalism.","One way to describe capitalism is as an economic system in which things are produced not to meet a social need, but so that the capitalist can sell them for a profit. This is precisely what corporations have done to the internet – they have turned it in to a big marketplace to sell things that most people do not need so that a tiny privileged few can hoard more wealth.","As long as we are living in such a system, the pressure will always be on companies like Facebook to be as predatory as they can to maximise profits for its shareholders.","It is what drives capitalists to steal private data and sell it to the highest bidder, or to steal entire communities of humans and sell them to the highest bidder.","Those of us who believe that a better world can be created, in which poverty is eradicated and the caste system of worker and capitalist is abolished, are often accused of being dreamers and Utopians.","It's difficult to imagine that societies without capitalism have existed in the past, or that a world without capitalism is possible in the future, so, when it comes to privacy and social media, many people will just shrug and say that this is just how the world works. Since Facebook is offering us their platform, they will obviously take something from us in exchange.","However, when it comes to software and the internet, it shouldn't be so difficult to imagine a better world, because it already exists – and it’s a large eco-system of software developer communities that have defied the hegemony of capitalism to a large extent.","The open internet","Free and open source software (FOSS) is a category of software that anyone is free to use, modify and distribute without compensating the original developer – in essence, it is software that does not have a private owner.","The idea behind the free software movement is that society as a whole benefits from having software that is communally owned as it allows the public to use the software, and encourages software developers to improve on each other's work rather than re-inventing the wheel within the confines of private company walls.","In fact, much of the software that forms the backbone of the internet and the web today is a product of the FOSS movement, whether it is the operating system of a website server (Linux), the software that delivers a webpage to you (Apache or nginx), the platform used to manage a website (Wordpress) or the browser on your computer to view a website (Firefox).","There is also a benefit to privacy. Capitalist entities like Facebook and Microsoft keep the source code of their software a fiercely guarded secret, so that no one can examine how it works in order to prevent anyone from copying or modifying it.","This means that when Facebook or Microsoft tell us that their software is not spying on us or stealing data from us, we have no way of verifying this and just have to take their word for it. FOSS software, on the other hand, is transparent.","For many of us, it may still be hard to understand the economics of how or why anyone would work on building a product that they cannot sell. But one example of this is Wikipedia.","Not only is the software used to run Wikipedia FOSS, but crucially all of the articles on Wikipedia have been written by volunteers, and can be freely copied, improved and distributed by the public.","The volunteers contribute their time to Wikipedia not in order to make a financial profit, but because they believe that society can benefit from their knowledge, as they can benefit from the knowledge of others.","This idea of helping each other voluntarily (sometimes called “mutual aid”) is at the same time both intuitive and extremely alien. On the one hand, this is how we behave with our family and friends, yet it is alien because our interactions with the rest of society are not dominated by sharing.","So, the technological groundwork has already been laid for an internet which doesn't doesn't steal data or exploit its users. It now requires the political and moral will of the rest of society to adopt those tools and services. They don't have the massive marketing budgets that the corporations have so you have to search for them yourself. And they don't have all of the frills of commercial projects just yet, but as more and more people join and contribute the services will get better and will start looking more like what you’re used to.","So for example, an alternative to Facebook is the Diaspora social network, where the data of users is not in the possession of a single corporate entity. Instead, the data is distributed across several independently managed but federated “pods”, among which you can choose where put your data (or you can even set up your own pod if you have a bit of technical knowledge).","The FOSS movement has shown that the internet and information technology can serve a greater purpose than a marketplace in which the richest companies always win – often at the unknown expense of the public.","Disclaimer: The viewpoints expressed by the authors do not necessarily reflect the opinions, viewpoints and editorial policies of TRT World.","We welcome all pitches and submissions to TRT World Opinion – please send them via email, to opinion.editorial@trtworld.com"],"isopubdate":""}

Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports “several days ago” that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report.","Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company’s SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake “a large scale research project in the U.S.,” but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan’s company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of Kogan’s data was used in its 2016 election work for the “avoidance of doubt.”","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","The Facebook blog post, written by deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the “public prominence” of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an “unacceptable violation of trust” and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties “responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.”","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Trump’s general-election campaign.","Trump’s campaign Saturday denied using the firm’s data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","“The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,” the campaign said in a statement. “Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.”","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica’s role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.","A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.","The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.","Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized. Flynn is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference after pleading guilty to a felony charge.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nix said Assange denied the request, which came after Assange had said publicly that he had the emails. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.","Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling.","Revelations that Cambridge Analytica misused social media data could also be of interest to Mueller’s investigation. While much of the thrust of special counsel’s investigation has been tightly held, Mueller has requested that the firm turn over the emails of any employees who worked on the campaign, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last year.","Mueller is also looking at the role Wikileaks played in acquiring and making public the stolen Clinton campaign emails.","Here at MaineToday Media we value our readers and are committed to growing our community by encouraging you to add to the discussion.","To ensure conscientious dialogue we have implemented a strict no-bullying policy.

Joseph Chancellor, a former director of Global Science Research (GSR), currently works as a virtual reality researcher at the social media giant, a Facebook spokesperson told CBS News on Sunday.","The spokesperson said Chancellor's past work has no bearing on the current work he does at Facebook, but the company is examining the situation.","Cambridge Analytica, the data firm hired by President Trump's 2016 campaign, was reportedly involved in the harvesting of personal data from more than 50 million Facebook users. The data firm said Saturday that it contracted GSR to take on a \"large scale research project\" in the U.S., but said \"no data from GSR was used\" as part of services it provided to the Trump campaign.","Facebook announced Saturday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and University of Cambridge researcher Aleksandr Kogan for violating the social media company's standards and practices. Kogan served as a director of GSR during the same time as Chancellor.","In a statement to CBS News, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said \"there was no recollection of any interactions or emails\" with Chancellor.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said Kogan built an app that provided a personality quiz to Facebook users, but the social media giant claims he passed the content onto Cambridge Analytica. That firm then used the data to build \"psychographic profiles\" about voters. Facebook said it demanded the destruction of the data it acquired, but learned several days ago that it hadn't been destroyed.","Lawmakers in both the U.S. and the U.K. are demanding that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explain how the data theft occurred and how the company plans to protect consumers.","\"A lot of the spotlight is going to be on Cambridge Analytica because it seems like they were being a little deceitful here, but I think we have to look equally critically at Facebook,\" Wired senior reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN on Saturday.","She continued, \"This is just emblematic of such a crucial underlying issue with Facebook: they've created this incredibly powerful data operation and sell really robust data to their clients but they have very few mechanisms in place to ensure people aren't going to abuse that data.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

He said that the so-called psychography profiles combined Facebook data with information gathered from other \"top commercial data providers\" and that data included specific information about voter \"demographics, geographics, purchase history, and interests.\"","When a Facebook user engaged with the survey, he said, the user implicitly gave the company access to a broad spectrum of personal data that Facebook provides for advertisers. The app reached further, giving the company access to profile data from people in the users' broader circle of Facebook friends who had, wittingly or otherwise, set their security setting relatively weakly. Though the company likely did not use a traditional \"hack\" to access user information, they may have violated Facebook's terms of use by bulk harvesting and repurposing user data.","When asked about how the company chose what to include in Facebook surveys, Oczkowski would only say that, it collects data from \"exclusive relationships\" with data vendors \"and through direct response projects.\"","Cambridge Analytica pushed back Saturday against the notion that it harvested any data, insisting it had contracted a firm in the U.K. to do research. Cambridge Analytica insisted that when it learned that it had been sold data it shouldn't have, the firm deleted the data.","Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data. 1/8","\"Inner Demons\"","Getting users to interact with the survey was key to unlocking the data. A source close to the 2016 Trump campaign and familiar with Cambridge Analytica's tactics explained that the surveys used by the company used inflammatory language designed to provoke the \"worst tendencies\" in Facebook users -- meaning that it would stir up the kind of emotion that would prompt an interaction. Cambridge Analytica said Saturday it did not use any Facebook data for the campaign. Mr. Trump's 2016 digital guru, Brad Parscale, told \"60 Minutes\" last year that the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's controversial practice of psychographics.","Cambridge Analytica specializes in psychographics, which microtargets ads based on personality. In the words of whistleblower Christopher Wylie: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons.\"","That allowed the company to scale up their data gathering rapidly. Wired reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN Saturday that by convincing 270,000 people to interact with the app, GSR managed to tap into the data of over 50 million users.","CEO Alexander Nix described the firm as \"fundamentally politically agnostic and an apolitical organization,\" and even tweeted Saturday that President Obama's 2012 \"pioneered microtargeting.\"","But Oczkowski contradicted that assertion, and explained that \"we served as the data agency of record, but our role quickly evolved as the cycle progressed.\"","The company developed \"three pillars\" of exclusive technology, Oczkowski said, including data science and analytics, digital marketing designed for persuasion and get-out-the-vote (GOTV), and polling research. \"Having a large amount of control and input into each of these three areas allowed us to be extremely efficient and reactive,\" he said. \"It also allowed us to easily integrate with the staff at Giles-Parscale and the RNC.\"","When asked specifically how the company leveraged Facebook for other data, Oczkowski explained that the company's data analytics prowess assisted the Trump campaign for everything from resource allocation, calculating the most efficient candidate travel stops, advertising, and the language used in surrogate speeches, and even \"personalizing messaging to the individual voter.\"","\"Huge exaggeration\"","Within GOP data circles, however, the company's extravagant claims about the effectiveness of Facebook data and artificial intelligence are heavily criticized. \"I'm not saying they lied,\" said a former Trumpworld staffer shortly after the election, \"but for Cambridge Analytica to run victory laps and claim they won the election for Trump is a huge exaggeration. Data can do a lot of things, but there's a limit to how effective it is. Cambridge Analytica's claims went far beyond that limit.\"","Cambridge Analytica is not alone in their use of Facebook and social media to target consumers with advertising. Machine learning is one of the fastest growing sectors of business technology, and a number of firms have adopted similar tactics. Amazon, Google, Twitter, and a host of other cloud-based Internet giants are hiring AI experts and building algorithms that automate advertising.","It's no surprise that cloud giants are actively using big data analysis models to aid private industry in everything from cybersecurity to marketing. Oczkowski described the potential application actionable data scraped from Facebook users as potentially \"endless.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

How much data am I sharing with the social media giant? Did I really give permission for it to be collected and stored?","And, even more seriously, have I handed over my friends' data to be stored on some Californian server?","I am one of those people and what I've discovered has left me somewhat shocked. Over the weekend I got hold of my Facebook data. It's easy enough, you go to settings, then general account settings and click on download my data.","An hour or so later an email arrived with a link to click and I was downloading a 675MB folder chronicling all of my life on the network since I signed up in 2007.","Big numbers","At first sight there was nothing very troubling - I would expect all the photos and videos I'd ever posted to be there, and scrolling down my timeline provided an entertaining glimpse of my life over the last decade.","I did notice that for some years every song I'd listened to on Spotify was listed, a handy reminder that when you link any external app to Facebook it then gathers a lot more data about you.","But then I clicked on a file called contacts. I was taken aback to find my entire contact list, thousands of phone numbers. Now this was not limited to Facebook friends and included many people in the public eye who might be disturbed to find that their private numbers were stored in this way.","I cannot remember what happened when I set up my Facebook account back in 2007 - in those naive days I could well have clicked yes when invited to upload my contacts so that I could see who else was part of this new young community. So, my fault I suppose.","Then I noticed that at the top of the list were some numbers that cannot have been sucked into the Facebook machine a decade ago because I had only added them in recent weeks. They included, ironically, the mobile number of Carole Cadwalladr, the journalist who has blown open the whole story of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.","So this means that every time I enter a new number into my phone's database, it somehow ends up with Facebook - the company is in effect monitoring me.","This is not the most startling example of Facebook's data collection. At least one user has reported that all of his text messages from an Android phone have somehow ended up being stored by Mark Zuckerberg's company.","Even if Facebook users agree to share this data, their friends whose numbers or text messages are being collected almost certainly have not. And even if those people have never joined Facebook - or have decided to delete their accounts - it looks as though some of their data will stay with the social network as long as the people who provided it remain.","Facebook says that uploading your contacts is a normal part of signing up with many messaging or social apps - and insists that users are given a clear choice.","People are expressly asked if they want to give permission to upload their contacts from their phone - it's explained right there in the apps when you get started. People can delete previously uploaded information at any time.","The company is right to say this is common practice. And if you think it is creepy that Facebook is storing this information, what about Apple's iCloud where millions store their iPhone data, including their contacts?","In any case, Facebook insists it never shares this data with anyone else. The problem is that its business model, unlike Apple's, depends on exploiting its users' data. And given what they have learned over the last week about how that information may have been used, many Facebook users may not be inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt."],"isopubdate":""}

The National Association of Attorneys General published the letter addressed to Zuckerberg which can be read in full below:","Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:","The undersigned State and Territory Attorneys General are profoundly concerned about the recently published reports that personal user information from Facebook profiles was provided to third parties without the users’ knowledge or consent. As the chief law enforcement officers of our respective states, we place a priority on protecting user privacy, which has been repeatedly placed at risk because of businesses’ failure to properly ensure those protections. Most recently, we have learned from news reports that the business practices within the social media world have evolved to give multiple software developers access to personal information of Facebook users. These reports raise serious questions regarding consumer privacy.","Early reports indicate that user data of at least 50 million Facebook profiles may have been misused and misappropriated by third-party software developers (“developers”). According to these reports, Facebook’s previous policies allowed developers to access the personal data of “friends” of people who used applications on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those “friends.” It has also been reported that while providing other developers access to personal Facebook user data, Facebook took as much as thirty (30) percent of payments made through the developers’ applications by Facebook users.","Facebook apparently contends that this incident of harvesting tens of millions of profiles was not the result of a technical data breach; however, the reports allege that Facebook allowed third parties to obtain personal data of users who never authorized it, and relied on terms of service and settings that were confusing and perhaps misleading to its users.","These revelations raise many serious questions concerning Facebook’s policies and practices, and the processes in place to ensure they are followed. Were those terms of service clear and understandable, or buried in boilerplate where few users would even read them? How did Facebook monitor what these developers did with all the data that they collected? What type of controls did Facebook have over the data given to developers? Did Facebook have protective safeguards in place, including audits, to ensure developers were not misusing the Facebook user’s data? How many users in our respective states were impacted? When did Facebook learn of this breach of privacy protections? During this timeframe, what other third party “research” applications were also able to access the data of unsuspecting Facebook users?","In addition to responses to these questions, we request an update about how Facebook will allow users to more easily control the privacy of their accounts. Even with the changes Facebook has made in recent years, many users still do not know that their profile—and personal data—is available to third-party vendors. Facebook has made promises about users’ privacy in the past, and we need to know that users can trust Facebook. With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.","Users of Facebook deserve to know the answers to these questions and more. We are committed to protecting our residents’ personal information. More specifically, we need to understand Facebook’s policies and procedures in light of the reported misuse of data by developers. We appreciate the information you have provided to date and expect your full cooperation going forward in our inquiries into your business practices. To that end, we expect a full accounting for what transpired and, answers to the questions we raised above. We look forward to your prompt response.","The letter was signed by 37 State Attorneys General from the following states and territories:","The Attorneys General interest in the case is unsurprising and was predicted by Laura Moy, the deputy director of the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology, last week in an interview where she stated, “State attorneys general will probably be looking at this case under state data security and breach notification laws and under state laws that prohibit unfair and deceptive practices by companies.”","Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie.

We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows.

It's right. What really happened is much worse.","On Saturday, an investigation by The New York Times, the Guardian, and its sister publication The Observer revealed that the data analytics firm that helped the Donald Trump presidential campaign had harvested the Facebook data of more than 50 million people in an effort to profile users and eventually target them with political ads.","Advertisement","In 2014, a researcher collected the data through an app that asked users to take a personality test for academic research purposes. Around 270,000 people agreed to have their data collected through the test, which its creator, Aleksandr Kogan, defined as “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.” But thanks to Facebook’s terms of service and its API at the time, the app was also able to collect data of their friends. This gave the researcher, who later handed the data to Cambridge Analytica, the raw information of more than 50 million people, according to the reports, which were largely based on the account of a former Cambridge Analytica data scientist.","The Observer called it one of Facebook’s “biggest ever data breaches.” The Times only referred to the incident as a “breach” once, using the term “leak” throughout the rest of the article. We at Motherboard believe the use of the expression “data breach” in this case is incorrect and may be confusing to readers.","As the news spread and echoed online, several websites and other publications called it a data breach. Manysecurityexperts and researchers—and Facebook itself—believe this is the wrong expression to refer to what happened here.","“It is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Facebook’s chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote in a deleted tweet.","Facebook’s vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false,” because the researcher who made the app obtained the data from “users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.”","Got a tip? You can contact this reporter securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, OTR chat at lorenzo@jabber.ccc.de, or email lorenzo@motherboard.tv","Advertisement","Saying that “everyone involved” consented seems misleading, given that only around 270,000 out of the 50 million people who got their data harvested reportedly signed up for the app. The others probably had no idea this app even existed. And since Facebook changes its privacy settings so frequently, we also don't know if the people who agreed to use the app fully understood what kind of data they were giving up. And no one at the time knew the data would later be handed out to a shadowy data analytics firm hired by the Trump campaign.","While we understand why some are describing the data Kogan handed to Cambridge Analytica as a breach, based on what’s been reported so far, we believe that describing this incident as a breach would, at least at the moment, mislead our readers.","We’ve been regularly covering data breaches for years. No one hacked into Facebook’s servers exploiting a bug, like hackers did when they stole the personal data of more than 140 million people from Equifax. No one tricked Facebook users into giving away their passwords and then stole their data, like Russian hackers did when they broke into the email accounts of John Podesta and others through phishing emails.","In 2014, when Kogan collected the data of 50 million people, he was playing by the rules. At the time, Facebook allowed third party apps to collect not only the data of the people who consented to giving it up, but also their friends’ data. The company later shut down this functionality.","Facebook says the data was misused because Kogan told Facebook he would use it only for academic research. But that might be the only anomalous thing about this case.","Facebook obviously doesn't want the public to think it suffered a massive security breach, like Yahoo did in 2013 and 2014. We agree not because we want to minimize the significance of the Cambridge Analytica story, but because the real story is far more troubling: This data collection was par for the course. In other words, it was a feature, not a bug. And while the process that Kogan exploited is no longer allowed, Facebook still collects—and then sells—massive amounts of data on its users.","Advertisement","As Zeynep Tufekci, the author of Twitter And Tear Gas, put it, Facebook’s vehement defense that this was not a data breach is itself actually a damning statement of what’s wrong with Facebook, and Silicon Valley’s ad industry in general.","“If your business is building a massive surveillance machinery, the data will eventually be used & misused,” Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies the social impact of technology, wrote on Twitter. “There is no informed consent because it's not possible to reasonably inform or consent.”","Facebook’s security team, Tufekci concluded, can’t mitigate the company’s business model, which is predicated on collecting as much of our data, and our friend’s data, as possible.","We can condemn the misuse of this data, and Facebook’s data collection practices, without calling it a data breach, a term that may confuse readers and distract them from what we believe is the real problem here: Silicon Valley giants have built massive data collection machines with almost no guardrails on how they are used."],"isopubdate":""}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Some of those services may have leveraged your data to undermine the very foundations of American democracy. Hard to say!","New reports from the Guardianand New York Timesreveal how a Trump-aligned data-gathering service called Cambridge Analytica \"exploited\" information from millions of people in the lead-up to the 2016 election. It was pretty simple: The firm created a personality test app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" and people opted in to take it, granting the app permission to scrape their personal data in the process. It also harvested their friends' data.","Facebook has a lot to answer for, but in the meantime, you might be curious to see if you've given sketchy apps access to your data over the years. There's a very good chance you have: I found today that 170 apps were able to access some level of my personal Facebook data. Some of them definitely seem off.","Though Facebook is fairly transparent about what kind of data apps are able to access when you connect them to your profile, granting permission on an indefinite basis only requires a couple of taps. And until now, users might reasonably expect that simple personality quizzes or one-off games weren't being used to create a complex network for the purposes of voter manipulation.","In other words, it's a good time to check in.","Here's how to check your app settings on Facebook:","- On desktop, click the downward facing arrow in the upper-right side of your News Feed. Then, click \"Settings.\"","- From there, tap \"Apps\" in the left-hand sidebar.","- On mobile, tap the icon showing three stacked lines. The icon is on top of your screen if you're using the Android app, and it's on the bottom if you're on iOS.","- Then, tap \"Settings.\" You may need to scroll down a bit to find it. Tap \"Account Settings,\" then scroll down and tap \"Apps.\"","- Finally, tap \"Logged in with Facebook\" to see the services accessing your account.","Once you're here, you'll be able to see all of the apps you've logged into with Facebook. A lot of them, like Airbnb or Amazon, are probably fine! But others should give you pause. For example, this embarrassing Pokemon personality quiz I took years ago:","It has access to a ton of my data, including my relationship status, friend list, and birthday. Needless to say, I clicked \"Remove App\" to get rid of it.","I don't remember taking this quiz—or, tragically, which Pokemon I am—though Facebook would reasonably say I opted into it and am therefore responsible for any data I hand over to it. But I signed up for it a long time ago, likely when I was intoxicated, and who knows what it's taken from me since then.","So: Take as much responsibility for yourself and your data as you can, because it impacts your friends, too. Dig through your connected apps. Remove some of them if you must. And hey, maybe think about deleting Facebook all together.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

It touches on how Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis may have used the firm to help win his seat in 2014 and how new progressive groups are using online tools to motivate liberal voters – without formally registering as political organizations.","Digital advertisers now wield enormous control over which users to target and how to tweak their messages – with few rules for disclosure.","Journalists, including those of us at WRAL News, already keep tabs on broadcast advertising through fact checks, Federal Communications Commission reports and other tools. That accountability isn't always perfect, but it's far better than what happens on Facebook.","To track this online advertising – and open up this shadowy world of influence for all to see – we need your help.","We've teamed up with ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative news outlet, to promote its Facebook Political Ad Collector. This free browser plugin, available for both Chrome and Firefox, enables users to automatically and anonymously send political ads on their Facebook pages to a public database that every voter, not just the press, can use. The system will allow both reporters and the public to analyze and track these ads throughout the election season.","\"The nature of online advertising is such that ads appear on people’s screens for just a few hours, and are limited to the audience that the advertiser has chosen. So, for example, if an advertiser micro-targets a group such as 40-year-old female motorcyclists in Nashville, Tennessee, (Facebook audience estimate: 1,300 people) with a misleading ad, it’s unlikely anyone other than the bikers will ever see those ads.\"","It's important to note that the browser plugin does not collect information that can be used to identify you, and it removes names, comments and profile links of friends who have liked the ads before it collects them. Neither reporters nor the public can see which ads were shown to which users in the searchable database (to read more about how the plugin was created, see ProPublica's methodology or the open-source code itself).","But the ad targeting data the plugin gathers from each ad in the coming months (which includes general categories like age and location) will help us learn more about how political campaigns target Facebook users, especially in North Carolina, and will empower deeper reporting about how these groups – on the left and the right – wage their war of influence online.","How well this all works depends on you.","The more of you who download and deploy the plugin, the more data we'll be able to gather, and the more political ads we'll be able to analyze, fact check and investigate.","So, if you're a Facebook user, join us in our effort to bring more transparency to online advertising and help us provide more meaningful reporting about campaign ad spending to our community.

But you wouldn’t necessarily know about it, considering that a larger data breach scandal has sucked the air out of the room.","While Facebook have preferred to use the verbiage “a breach of trust” rather than a “data breach” there’s no denying that we’re wrestling with online privacy, and how it could potentially impact our lives and our wallets.","If the Cambridge Analytica fiasco made us think about how data breaches could turn the political tables, the Equifax data breach of 2017 certainly lead to some soul-searching about how our financial data is trafficked online.","As you don’t “sign up” with Equifax, or any of the three credit reporting agencies in the US, it’s hard to know if you’ve been compromised. Credit reports are often pulled by banks, lenders, employers, and even landlords. This means that among the 45% of the population who were exposed in the Equifax data breach, a significant number may not have known that their data was vulnerable to hackers or identity theives.","Since our information is trafficked so readily on the internet, often without our explicit consent, swearing off a digital existence is no longer an option if you’re hoping to avoid a data breach.","In 2013, hackers exploited a weakness in a third-party vendor to access millions of Target customers. The hackers managed to gain access to a giant customer database, and used malware to steal names, email addresses, credit card numbers, and phone numbers of millions of Target customers. It’s estimated that 41 million Americans had their payment accounts exposed, with a further 60 million experiencing the theft of their contact information.","Since then, instances of data breaches have grown at an exponential rate. 2013 saw a total number of 614 data breaches. 2017 counted 1,579.

Obama was serving his first term as president. Google+ hadn’t arrived, let alone vanished again. Steve Jobs was still alive, as was Kim Jong Il. Facebook’s IPO hadn’t yet taken place, and its service was still fun to use—although it was littered with requests and demands from social games, like FarmVille and Pet Society.","I’d had enough of it—the click-farming games, for one, but also Facebook itself. Already in 2010, it felt like a malicious attention market where people treated friends as latent resources to be optimized. Compulsion rather than choice devoured people’s time. Apps like FarmVille sold relief for the artificial inconveniences they themselves had imposed.","In response, I made a satirical social game called Cow Clicker. Players clicked a cute cow, which mooed and scored a “click.” Six hours later, they could do so again. They could also invite friends’ cows to their pasture, buy virtual cows with real money, compete for status, click to send a real cow to the developing world from Oxfam, outsource clicks to their toddlers with a mobile app, and much more. It became strangely popular, until eventually, I shut the whole thing down in a bovine rapture—the “cowpocalypse.” It’s kind of a complicated story.","But one worth revisiting today, in the context of the scandal over Facebook’s sanctioning of user-data exfiltration via its application platform. It’s not just that abusing the Facebook platform for deliberately nefarious ends was easy to do (it was). But worse, in those days, it was hard to avoid extracting private data, for years even, without even trying. I did it with a silly cow game.","* * *","Cow Clicker is not an impressive work of software. After all, it was a game whose sole activity was clicking on cows. I wrote the principal code in three days, much of it hunched on a friend’s couch in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. I had no idea anyone would play it, although over 180,000 people did, eventually. I made a little money from the whole affair, but I never optimized it for revenue generation. I certainly never pondered using the app as a lure for a data-extraction con. I was just a strange man making a strange game on a lark.","And yet, if you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior. I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood, before my caprice raptured them into the digital void.","The authorization dialog for the game Candy Crush. (King / Facebook)","To understand why withdrawing data was the default behavior in Facebook apps, you have to know something about how apps get made and published on Facebook. In 2007, the company turned its social-network service into an application platform. The idea was that Facebook could grow its number of users and the time they spent engaged by allowing people and organizations to build services overtop of it. And those people and organizations would benefit by plugging into a large network of users, whose network of friends could easily be made a part of the service, both for social interaction and viral spread.","When you access an app on Facebook’s website, be it a personality-quiz, a game, a horoscope, or a sports community, the service presents you with an authorization dialog, where the specific data an app says it needs is displayed for the user’s consideration. That could be anything from your name, friend list, and email address, to your photos, likes, direct messages and more.","The information shared with an app by default has changed over time, and even a savvy user might never have known what comprised it. When I launched Cow Clicker in 2010, it was easier to acquire both “basic” information (name, gender, networks, and profile picture) and “extended” user information (location, relationship status, likes, posts, and more). In 2014, Facebook began an app review process for information beyond that which a user shared publicly, but for years before that, the decision was left to the user alone. This is consistent with Facebook’s longstanding, official policy on privacy, which revolves around user control rather than procedural verification.","App authorizations are not exceptionally clear. For one thing, the user must accept the app’s request to share data with it as soon as they open it for the first time, even before knowing what the app does or why. For another, the authorization is presented by Facebook, not by the third party, making it seem official, safe, and even endorsed.","Cow Clicker on Facebook, 2010. The game appears to live natively inside the Facebook interface, but it runs—and stores its data—on a separate server. (Cow Clicker / Ian Bogost / The Atlantic)","The part of the Facebook website where apps appear, under the blue top navigation (as seen above), introduces further confusion. To the average web user, especially a decade ago, it looked like the game or app was just a part of Facebook itself. The page is seamless, with no boundary between the site’s navigational chrome and the third-party app. If you look at the browser address bar while using a Facebook app on the website, the URL begins with “apps.facebook.com,” further cementing the impression that the user was safely ensconced in the comforting, blue cradle of Facebook’s care.","That’s not what really takes place. When a user loads an app, Facebook’s servers pass those requests to a remote computer, where the individual or company that made the app hosts their services. The app sends its responses to Facebook, which formats and presents them to the user, as if they were inside of Facebook itself.","The authorization process happens once, the first time the app is accessed for a specific user. After that, every time the user loads the app, Facebook sends it a payload of basic user data to facilitate the app’s operation (additional data can be requested separately when needed). For years, these transmissions were even conducted unencrypted, until Facebook required apps to communicate with its service over a secure connection.","Beyond its own terms of service for applications, which many developers probably didn’t read or feel compelled to heed, Facebook “secured” user data shared with third-parties by requiring every app to publish a privacy policy. Because data sharing was seen as a form of user-control, not corporate policy, Facebook doesn’t appear to review platform-developer privacy policies. As far as I can tell, all the platform did was to insure that accessing the URL for an app’s privacy policy didn’t result in a page-not-found error. Facebook was checking that privacy policies existed as reachable web pages, not that they existed as privacy policies, let alone policies that provided any specific protections. And besides, users probably never read the policies, which were linked unassumingly from the application-permissions interface. They might easily, and reasonably, have assumed that Facebook was simply reiterating its own privacy policy when presenting new access to an app. They would have been wrong.","In essence, Facebook was presenting apps as quasi-endorsed extensions of its core service to users who couldn’t have been expected to know better. That might explain why so many people feel violated by Facebook this week—they might never have realized that they were even using foreign, non-Facebook applications in the first place, let alone ones that were siphoning off and selling their data. The website always just looked like Facebook.","In the case of Cow Clicker, which only ever aimed to let people click on pictures of cows, I was able to access two potentially sensitive pieces of data without even trying.","The first is a player’s Facebook ID. This is a numeric, unique identifier attached to every Facebook account. Once I have your Facebook ID, I can look up your profile programmatically, or I can just load it in the public website by appending it to “facebook.com”—Mark Zuckerberg’s is 4.","These days, Facebook generates a unique, app-specific ID for each user, in order to prevent an app from connecting someone directly to Facebook profiles. But back in Cow Clicker’s heyday of 2010, Facebook didn’t do this, and every app got your actual ID. Those data could be correlated against other information—data collected from Facebook, fashioned by the app, or acquired elsewhere. Because I collected and stored my users’ true Facebook IDs to be able to count their clicks and build their pastures and the like, I still have them, and, in theory, I could use them nefariously. A 2014 terms-of-service update prohibits some of that activity, but not everyone cares about violating the Facebook terms of service.","The second type of information is a piece of profile data Cow Clicker received without asking for it. Back in 2010, Facebook still allowed users to join “networks”—affiliations like schools, workplaces, and organizations. In some cases, those affiliations required authorization, for example having an email address at a domain that corresponds with a university. Over time, verification became less important to Facebook, and now users can affiliate with schools or workplaces arbitrarily. The less friction, the more data.","In 2010, on my friend’s couch in Brooklyn, I noticed that Facebook was shipping user affiliation data over the wire to me, so I decided to store it. Facebook allowed apps to store data for which user permission was granted, but urged developers not to request or store more than it needed to operate. Putting affiliation data in the Cow Clicker database allowed me to provide leaderboard rankings by network, allowing my players to compete for clicks with their work colleagues or classmates.","That’s neither a terribly interesting feature nor a particularly wicked one. But because I stored the numerical identifiers for user affiliations, I still have them. Until 2016, I could use a database-query tool called FQL, Facebook Query Language, to retrieve the details of those networks, and correlate them back to my users. Had I wanted to, I could have recombined that information with other data and used it for retargeting.","Cow Clicker’s example is so modest, it might not even seem like a problem. What does it matter if a simple diversion has your Facebook ID, education, and work affiliations? Especially since its solo creator (that’s me) was too dumb or too lazy to exploit that data toward pernicious ends. But even if I hadn’t thought about it at the time, I could have done so years later, long after the cows vanished, and once Cow Clicker players forgot that they’d ever installed my app.","This is also why Zuckerberg’s response to the present controversy feels so toothless. Facebook has vowed to audit companies that have collected, shared, or sold large volumes of data in violation of its policy, but the company cannot close the Pandora’s box it opened a decade ago, when it first allowed external apps to collect Facebook user data. That information is now in the hands of thousands, maybe millions of people.","To be honest, I’m not even sure I know what the Facebook platform’s terms of service dictated that I do with user data acquired from Facebook. Technically, users could revoke certain app permissions later, and apps were supposed to remove any impacted data that they had stored. I doubt most apps did that, and I suspect users never knew—and still don’t know—that revoking access to an app they used eight years ago doesn’t do anything to reverse transmissions that took place years ago.","As Jason Koebler put it at Motherboard, it’s too late. “If your data has already been taken, Facebook has no mechanism and no power to make people delete it. If your data was taken, it has very likely been sold, laundered, and put back into Facebook.” Indeed, all the publicity around Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica crisis might be sending lots of old app developers, like me, back to old code and dusty databases, wondering what they’ve even got stored and what it might yet be worth.","Facebook’s laissez-faire openness surely contributed to the data-extraction free-for-all that’s playing itself out now via the example of Cambridge Analytica. But so did its move-fast-and-break-things attitude toward software development. The Facebook platform was truly a nightmare to use and to maintain. It was built like no other software system then extant, and it changed constantly—regular updates rolled out weekly. Old code broke, seemingly for no good reason. Some Facebook app developers were dishonest from the start, and others couldn’t help themselves once they saw the enormous volume of data they could slurp from millions or tens of millions of Facebook users. But many more were just struggling to eke out a part of their living in an ecosystem where people might discover them.","Millions of apps had been created by 2012, when I hung up my cowboy hat. Not only apps apparently designed with duplicity in mind, like Aleksandr Kogan’s personality-quiz, which extracted data that was then sold to Cambridge Analytica. But hundreds of thousands of creators of dumb toys, quizzes, games, and communities that might never have intended to dupe or violate users surely did so anyway, because Facebook rammed their data down our throats. On the whole, none of us asked for your data. But we have it anyway, and forever.","We want to hear what you think about this article.

By booting the companies from its platform \"pending further information,\" Facebook will no longer allow them to buy ads or manage their pages.","\"Protecting people's information is at the heart of what we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook,\"Grewel said, noting that Facebook had received recent reports of certain rules violations.","According to Grewal's statement, a University of Cambridge professor who had developed a personality prediction app for Facebook users called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" improperly passed user information to other parties, including Cambridge Analytica and SCL in 2015. Facebook allows some apps to get access to a user's profile and important data that identifies the user's preferences and interests.","Facebook said the professor, Cambridge Analytica, and the other parties involved agreed to destroy all the data at the time. But, Grewel said on Friday, \"several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.","Such information, if misused, can potentially help bad actors target Facebook users with ads and other information. This was apparently the case during the 2016 US presidential election. Trump's campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June that year to help target ads using voter data gathered from some 230 million adults.","Several news outlets reported in 2016 that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5 million for its services in September alone that year, a significant increase from the $250,000 it paid one month earlier.","The matter of those emails and an FBI investigation surrounding Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state had hamstrung the Clinton campaign, and was seen as one part of a broader effort by Russian operatives to influence the US election.","It also raised questions about whether Trump associates had cooperated with Russia's election-meddling activity, because Russian operatives capitalized on detailed user data to deliver targeted ads and content on Facebook and other social-media platforms.","Worries about whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin arose in part because the content touted by Russian state actors was highly specific, and targeted to competitive US voter precincts — details that some experts have said would not have been familiar to a foreign entity.","The Trump campaign has sought to distance itself from Cambridge Analytica, and has denied any wrongdoing.","In an email to Business Insider, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said the company \"fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service\" and said it is working with Facebook to resolve the matter.","Read Cambridge Analytica's full statement below:","\"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.","Cambridge Analytica's Commercial and Political divisions use social media platforms for outward marketing, delivering data-led and creative content to targeted audiences. They do not use or hold data from Facebook profiles.","In 2014, we contracted a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally-renowned institution to undertake a large scale research project in the United States.","This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR was also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. GSR obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook.","When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR.","We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.","No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.","Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations.\"","We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook. Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.","We Maintain Strict Standards and Policies","Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","Breaking the Rules Leads to Suspension","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.","How Things Have Changed","We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers. Now all apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process, which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.","In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list. This is just one of the many ways we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can manage or revoke those permissions at any time.","On an ongoing basis, we also do a variety of manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with our policies and a positive experience for users. These include steps such as random audits of existing apps along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing apps.","We enforce our policies in a variety of ways — from working with developers to fix the problem, to suspending developers from our platform, to pursuing litigation.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process.”","No surprises","That Zuckerberg has spurned the U.K.’s request to appear in person should not come as a major surprise. In an interview with Wired last week, Zuckerberg said that if he were the best person to testify before Congress in the U.S. he would, but he added that this scenario was unlikely.","“… If it is ever the case that I am the most-informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify, I will happily do that,” Zuckerberg said. “But the reason why we haven’t done that so far is because there are people at the company whose full jobs are to deal with legal compliance or some of these different things, and they’re just fundamentally more in the details on those things. So as long as it’s a substantive testimony where what folks are trying to get is as much content as possible, I’m not sure when I’ll be the right person.”","Fast-forward six days, and it’s clearer than ever that Zuckerberg has no intention of putting himself in the hot seat.","“Facebook fully recognizes the level of public and Parliamentary interest in these issues and supports your belief that these issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position,” Facebook’s head of U.K. public policy, Rebecca Stimson, said in a statement. “As such, Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence in person to the Committee.”","Zuckerberg may have a tougher time avoiding testifying in the U.S., where he lives and Facebook is headquartered. Just yesterday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) confirmed reports that it was conducting an investigation into Facebook over data privacy concerns.

Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn't disclosed it until now.","The developments are the latest to show how people try to exploit Facebook in ways that could sway elections, and in the worst cases even undermine democracy. Before the Cambridge imbroglio, there were Russian agents running election-related propaganda campaigns through targeted ads and fake political events.","Wylie claimed Cambridge Analytica used the data it had while speaking with Russian businesses. He also said that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, what's different here is that people wouldn't know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.","Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing and said it deleted all data it received from a contractor after learning the data had been obtained in violation of Facebook policies.

In a letter to the FEC, Senator Richard Blumenthal said that Wylie’s disclosures have raised significant issues that warrant the attention of the FEC pertaining to the involvement of foreign nationals and political action committees in the management of election campaigns.","“I urge the FEC to take these allegations seriously, open an investigation into possible violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) by Cambridge Analytica and its clients, and take enforcement action as necessary,” Blumenthal wrote. In an exclusive report, ‘The Washington Post’ said that CA employed dozens of non-US citizens in its political strategy and communications work for state campaigns, Congressional candidates, and political action committees working in the US.","CA was founded as an American subsidiary of the British consulting firm Strategic Communication Laboratories (“the SCL Group”) by the director of its elections division, Alexander Nix. Despite presenting CA as an American face for the SCL Group, media reports indicate that its leadership and employees were mostly foreign nationals working on tourist visas with the company providing potentially misleading letters to help with entry into the country, the lawmaker wrote.","Blumenthal said that millions of dollars in payments from political action committees were made to CA at the same time that the firm was directly employed by three presidential campaigns and multiple Congressional campaigns. In the 2014 mid-term and 2016 presidential elections, CA played a direct role in managing strategy and communications for Republican campaigns across state and federal offices while working for conservative political action committees (PACs) supporting those same candidates, it said.","According to the New York Times, one of CA’s most lucrative clients has been former Ambassador John Bolton’s PAC, “John Bolton Super PAC”, which has spent nearly USD 1.2 million on its services since 2014. Bolton has now been appointed as National Security Advisor to the US president. The firm was reportedly contracted by Boltons PAC to perform “behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging”, designing and targeting online and television advertisements, Blumenthal said.","“The company provided these services at the same time as working directly for the same candidates and state parties. Additionally, Cambridge Analytica’s foreign staff was closely involved in the strategy and communications of the Bolton PAC with the firm reportedly writing talking points for Mr. Bolton,” he wrote. Meanwhile, Senator Jerry Moran sought an explanation regarding how the personal data of 50 million Facebook users was transmitted to Cambridge Analytica without users’ consent and how that information was used.","In light of reports that Cambridge Analytica mined information from 50 million Facebook users and irrefutable evidence that Russia used the social media site to spread disinformation, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. “For too long, Facebook has operated like the wild west, which has made the site vulnerable to abuse by organisations like Cambridge Analytica and allowed Russia to weaponise information,” she said.","“Like millions of Americans, I use Facebook to connect with my community, but its clear this tool has been exploited to spread disinformation and propaganda,” said Pingree. “I am encouraged to hear Mark Zuckerberg say he is open to increased regulatory oversight of Facebook, but he needs to testify before Congress and detail how he plans to safeguard his website from cyberattacks and protect user data,” the lawmaker said.","Meanwhile, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been forced to issue a statement outlining his firm’s role in the scandal and apologised last Wednesday to its billions of users for the breach. The company has seen its stock market value plunge by around USD 75 million since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channelled to Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The culprit is a small but significant change to Facebook's Terms of Service (its contract with its users) that was made without full notification to all users. The change was a seemingly radical shift: Facebook amended its contract language to reserve the right to continue to use member content forever -- even long after users have closed their accounts or deleted their content.","Users post a great deal of content on their Facebook pages, from age, to marital status, to favorite movies, cars, and even political affiliations. This content is valuable to Facebook and its affiliates for marketing purposes and for possible resale. Can Facebook now do anything it wants with that content? That answer is unclear, but what is clear is that Facebook should not -- and legally cannot -- unilaterally change its Terms of Service without giving users proper notice.","In this column, I will outline Facebook's actions and the public's response. I will also discuss why Facebook was legally required to give its members proper notice of the change, coupled with a chance to unsubscribe or at least to have their prior data governed by the earlier user agreement.","Facebook's Foolish Move: Amending Its Terms of Service and Failing to Be Open with Users About the Change","This is not the first time that Facebook has caused a public outcry over its privacy practices. As I have noted in previous columns such as this one, Facebook has tried new features involving user content that have sparked controversy. This time, however, Facebook took a bold step with its contract that seemed to alter the very nature of the bargain it had struck with its members.","When you join Facebook, under its Terms of Service, you grant Facebook a \"license\" (that is, legal permission) to use your content \"on or in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof.\" To some extent, such a license is necessary. While you are using Facebook, it may need to process, store, or share your data with others as part of providing services to you. The controversy occurred because of Facebook's recent revision to the license – purporting to eliminate language that guaranteed that the license would \"automatically expire\" if content were removed from the site.","How did Facebook notify customers of this change? First, Suzie White, Facebook's corporate counsel for commercial transactions, announced the change on the company's blog on February 4. Ms. White wrote, \"We want to let you know that today we're updating our Terms of Use -- the rules you and Facebook agree to when you sign up to use the site. We used to have several different documents that outlined what people could and could not do on Facebook, but now we're consolidating all this information to one central place. We've also simplified and clarified a lot of information that applies to you, including some things you shouldn't do when using the site.\"","White did provide a link to the new Terms of Service, but did not highlight the change relating to the perpetual license. Facebook also did not send out an email or any other mass communication to notify users of these changes. And White's brief post, which didn't call attention to the content license, largely went unnoticed by users.","A few days later, a blog, The Consumerist, drew public attention to the change. The blog described the change as \"We Can Do Anything We Want With Your Content. Forever.\" That description was pretty much accurate. The new Terms of Service read as follows:","\"You hereby grant Facebook an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to (a) use, copy, publish, stream, store, retain, publicly perform or display, transmit, scan, reformat, modify, edit, frame, translate, excerpt, adapt, create derivative works and distribute (through multiple tiers), any User Content you (i) Post on or in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof subject only to your privacy settings or (ii) enable a user to Post, including by offering a Share Link on your website and (b) to use your name, likeness and image for any purpose, including commercial or advertising, each of (a) and (b) on or in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof.\"","The new Terms of Service differed from the old Terms of Service, due to the deletion of these two sentences: \"You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time. If you choose to remove your User Content, the license granted above will automatically expire, however you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content.\" These sentences had made the license limited, not perpetual.","Users Revolt, EPIC Threatens to Complain, and Facebook Caves","In response to the furor over the Facebook Terms of Service changes, the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) prepared a draft complaint, which it planned to file with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), stating that Facebook's changes amounted to a deceptive trade practice. The complaint contended that \"It simply cannot be correct that Facebook, having induced millions of Internet users to provide detailed personal information to share with their friends and colleagues, can now transform the terms of service under a take-it-or-leave-it edict that does not even allow users who choose to cancel the service the opportunity to recapture the data they provided. It is precisely in such circumstances that agencies charged with protecting consumers and safeguarding a fair and transparent marketplace must intervene.\"","Meanwhile, Facebook users founded the site People against the New Terms of Service to protest the change -- which now has 130,000 members and is growing.","Based on the possible FTC enforcement action and the public criticism, Facebook caved. Barry Schmitt, a Facebook spokesperson, noted, \"It was never our intention to confuse people or make them uneasy about sharing on Facebook. I also want to be very clear that Facebook does not, nor have we ever, claimed ownership over people's content. Your content belongs to you.\" Schmitt added, \"We do need certain licenses in order to facilitate the sharing of your content through our service. That's where the Terms of Use come in.\" Schmitt noted that Facebook would be studying its Terms of Use and revising them anew but \"[i]n the meantime, we've decided to revert to the old Terms as we work to address this.\"","EPIC and other privacy groups rightly heralded this as a victory for Facebook members. But let's imagine that Facebook hadn't backed down. Could it have prevailed in defending the new Terms of Service?","Would the New Terms of Service Have Been Enforceable? Not Without Direct Notice to Customers, According to a Ninth Circuit Decision","Facebook backed down in the face of opposition. But was the change to their terms of service enforceable? The answer is likely no. Facebook did not provide true notice to its members of the changes it had made. And in 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Douglas v. Talk America Inc., held that a company could not unilaterally change its contract with customers by posting the new terms on its website.","In that case, former AOL subscribers brought a class action against Talk America (a company acquired by AOL) on the ground that it had attempted to change its Terms of Service simply by posting a revised contract on its website, without any further notice to customers. The revised contract purported to add certain service charges, waive users' right to bring class actions, and add an arbitration clause and a New York choice-of-law provision. The case appears to have been the first of its kind. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the revised Terms of Service was not a binding modification or new contract – defined by the classic requirements of offer, acceptance and consideration. Instead, it was merely an offer, which would not be binding until and unless users accepted it.","The Ninth Circuit also made clear that users did not accept the offer simply by continuing to use the service. In addition, it noted the problem with the practice of simply posting new Terms of Service without directly notifying users, explaining that a party would not \"know when to check the website for possible changes to the contract terms without being notified that the contract has been changed and how.\" In addition, the Court noted that it would be cumbersome for users to have to check the site daily for possible changes to the Terms of Service contract, comparing every word of it with the version that had been posted the day before. Finally, while the reported decision did not state whether the original contract permitted posting of changes online, under the Ninth Circuit's logic it seems very unlikely that such a provision would moot the need for direct notice to customers.","If Facebook Had Simply Given Users Direct Notice of the Changes to Its Terms of Service, Would The Change Then Have Been Legal?","Now, let's suppose – contrary to fact – that Facebook had given users direct notice of the change to its Terms of Service, rather than merely posting them on its blog. Would that solve the company's legal problems? Not necessarily, for a deceptive trade practices issue would still remain.","As EPIC argued, Facebook has induced people to subscribe and participate because of its privacy practices and its original Terms of Services -- which seemed to say that once you delete your material, Facebook relinquishes any right to use it, aside from archiving it. A court, or the FTC, might deem it unfair or deceptive for Facebook to change the rules of the game after enticing consumers to be free with what they posted on their Facebook pages.","But what if, in addition to providing users with direct notice of the change in the Terms of Service, Facebook had also offered customers the chance to unsubscribe and thus have their information kept confidential? Or, what if users received direct notice and Facebook's new Terms of Service had explicitly not applied to existing information, but only to future information? In that case, the Terms of Service might pass muster, for users could no longer claim a bait-and-switch as to old material, and it seems unreasonable to ask a company never to change its Terms of Service in a prospective – as opposed to retrospective – way.","The Need for Notice to Users Is Also Underlined By the FTC's Gateway Case","As noted above, EPIC had planned to file a complaint challenging Facebook's actions with the FTC -- which already requires that users must be given notice, and must accept companies' material changes to their privacy policies. For example, in the case In re Gateway Learning Corp., filed in 2003, the FTC charged that Gateway engaged in an illegal \"unfair and deceptive practice\" when it materially changed its privacy policy and attempted to apply it retroactively to data it had previously collected from consumers. Gateway had not provided its customers with notice of the changes. This was the first FTC case of this nature.","More specifically, the FTC alleged that Gateway Learning (the sellers of \"Hooked on Phonics\") had violated federal law when it rented out its customers' personal information to marketers, despite explicit promises made in its privacy policy. The FTC claimed that, after collecting consumers' information, Gateway Learning altered its privacy policy to allow it to share the information with third parties without notifying consumers or getting their prior consent. This seems like the same kind of bait-and-switch argument we saw above with the Talk America/AOL case, and arguably with the Facebook situation.","According to the FTC, since 2000, Gateway Learning's online privacy policy had stated, \"We do not sell, rent or loan any personally identifiable information regarding our consumers with any third party unless we receive customer's explicit consent.\"","However, the FTC alleged that, despite these promises, Gateway Learning started renting out its customers' data -- including their names, addresses, phone numbers, and even the age ranges and gender of their children. The marketers who received such data would use it to send targeted mailings and telemarketing calls.","In June 2003, Gateway Learning revised its online privacy policy for its Hooked on Phonics website to say that \"from time to time\" Gateway Learning would provide consumers' personal information to \"reputable companies\" whose products or services consumers might find of interest, the FTC complaint alleged. However, according to the FTC, Gateway Learning continued to also rent out data collected under the earlier policy, and failed to contact consumers who had already provided their information to give them notice of the new privacy policy. Nor did Gateway highlight on its website the fact that the privacy policy had changed.","Ultimately, the FTC's settlement barred Gateway from making deceptive claims about how it would use consumers' information, and from applying material changes in its privacy policy retroactively, without consumers' consent.","The Lesson for Facebook and Other Companies: Don't Use the Bait-and-Switch Regarding Past Data, and Give Users Direct Notice of Terms of Service Changes","The Gateway settlement seems directly relevant to the Facebook dispute – raising the same kind of issues of privacy, notice, retroactivity and the bait-and-switch. Among the lessons Facebook should take away from the controversyis that its members do not like to lose control of their information for good; they want clear, direct notice if changes are made; and they do not want information that Facebook promised to protect to be suddenly stripped of protection. 130,000 concerned members have registered their displeasure and the number is growing. Facebook needs to re-earn its users' trust – for both legal and loyalty reasons.","Anita Ramasastry, a FindLaw columnist, is the D.

(AFP Photo/Loic Venance)","LONDON (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company’s subscribers. The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union’s new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","“For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. “I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen’s rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I’ll settle for 2018.”","The US has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing former president Barack Obama’s 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google’s dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized “the right to be forgotten,” allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there’s no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany’s use of personal information to target Jews hasn’t been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today’s world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","“The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,” said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU’s new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking “I Agree.” The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there’s the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn’t legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it’s too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to “bracket off” European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While US-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn’t go down well in Europe.","“Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,” she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. “We’ve built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,” it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone’s data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the US, where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","“Cambridge Analytica’s story sounds like a spy novel,” he said. “It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,” he said. “We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.”","By signing up, you agree to our\nterms\nYou hereby accept The Times of Israel Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, and you agree to receive the latest news & offers from The Times of Israel and its partners or ad sponsors."],"isopubdate":""}
{"originalurl":"https://qz.com/520652/groundwork-eric-schmidt-startup-working-for-hillary-clinton-campaign/","title":"The stealthy, Eric Schmidt-backed startup that’s working to put Hillary Clinton in the White House — Quartz","text":["The stealthy, Eric Schmidt-backed startup that’s working to put Hillary Clinton in the White House","An under-the-radar startup funded by billionaire Eric Schmidt has become a major technology vendor for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, underscoring the bonds between Silicon Valley and Democratic politics.","The Groundwork, according to Democratic campaign operatives and technologists, is part of efforts by Schmidt—the executive chairman of Google parent-company Alphabet—to ensure that Clinton has the engineering talent needed to win the election. And it is one of a series of quiet investments by Schmidt that recognize how modern political campaigns are run, with data analytics and digital outreach as vital ingredients that allow candidates to find, court, and turn out critical voter blocs.","But campaigns—lacking stock options and long-term job security—find it hard to attract the elite engineering talent that Facebook, Google, and countless startups rely on. That’s also part of the problem that Schmidt and the Groundwork are helping Clinton’s team to solve.","The Groundwork is one of the Clinton campaign’s biggest vendors, billing it for more than $177,000 in the second quarter of 2015, according to federal filings. Yet many political operatives know little about it. Its website consists entirely of a grey-on-black triangle logo that suggests “the digital roots of change” while also looking vaguely like the Illuminati symbol:","“We’re not trying to obfuscate anything, we’re just trying to keep our heads down and do stuff,” says Michael Slaby, who runs the Groundwork. He was the chief technology officer for president Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, a top digital executive for Obama 2012, and the former chief technology strategist for TomorrowVentures, Schmidt’s angel investment fund.","He explained that the Groundwork and its parent company, Chicago-based Timshel—which according to its website is named for a Hebrew word meaning “you may” and is devoted to “helping humanity solve our most difficult social, civic, and humanitarian challenges”—are “all one project, with the same backers,” whom he declined to name.","“There are a lot of people who can write big checks. Eric recognizes how the technology he’s been building his whole career can be applied to different spaces.”","Schmidt did not respond to several requests for comment. But several Democratic political operatives and technologists, who would only speak anonymously to avoid offending Schmidt and the Clinton campaign, confirmed that the Groundwork is funded at least in part by the Alphabet chairman.","The Groundwork was initially based in an office in downtown Brooklyn just blocks from the headquarters of its biggest client: the Clinton campaign. There, a staff made up mostly of senior software engineers began building the tools and infrastructure that could give her a decisive advantage.","Slaby has a reputation for being able to bridge the cultural divide between politicos and techies. And sources say the Groundwork was created to minimize the technological gap that occurs between presidential campaign cycles while pushing forward the Big Data infrastructure that lies at the heart of modern presidential politics.","There is also another gap in play: The shrinking distance between Google and the Democratic Party. Former Google executive Stephanie Hannon is the Clinton campaign’s chief technology officer, and a host of ex-Googlers are currently employed as high-ranking technical staff at the Obama White House. Schmidt, for his part, is one of the most powerful donors in the Democratic Party—and his influence does not stem only from his wealth, estimated by Forbes at more than $10 billion.","At a time when private-sector money is flowing largely unchecked into US politics, Schmidt’s funding of the Groundwork suggests that 2016’s most valuable resource may not be donors capable of making eight-figure donations to Super PACs, but rather supporters who know how to convince talented engineers to forsake (at least for awhile) the riches of Silicon Valley for the rough-and-tumble pressure cooker of a presidential campaign.","“There are a lot of people who can write big checks,” Slaby says. “Eric recognizes how the technology he’s been building his whole career can be applied to different spaces. The idea of tech as a force multiplier is something he deeply understands.”","The technology that helped re-elect Obama","Although Obama’s technology staff downplays credit for his election victories, there’s no doubt they played a crucial role. One former Obama staffer, Elan Kriegel, who now leads analytics for the Clinton campaign, suggested the technology accounted for perhaps two percentage points of the campaign’s four percent margin of victory in 2012.","The 2012 campaign’s analytics team constructed a complex model of the electorate to identify 15 million undecided voters that could be swayed to Obama’s side. They drew on databases which compiled a comprehensive record of voters’ interactions with the campaign—Facebook pages liked, volunteer contacts, events attended, money donated—and assigned them a score based on how strongly they supported Obama.","Those carefully constructed models and databases paid dividends for everything from advertising and campaign fundraising emails—which were rigorously A/B tested to determine the optimum wording and design (subject lines that said “Hey!” were found to be annoying but effective)—to voter polling and get-out-the-vote efforts on election day.","Harper Reed","Members of the Obama tech team, including Michael Slaby and Harper Reed, with Eric Schmidt in 2012.","Perhaps the standout innovation from the Obama campaign was known as “Optimizer,” a tool that allowed the campaign to deploy carefully targeted television ads. Rather than rely on broad demographic data about programs and time slots, the Obama tech team accessed detailed information from TV set-top boxes to identify the most cost-efficient ways to reach hard-to-reach voters. The campaign’s top media consultant, Jim Margolis—now Clinton’s top media consultant—estimates Optimizer saved the campaign perhaps $40 million.","After the campaign, Optimizer became the cornerstone of a new startup called Civis Analytics that spun out of the Obama campaign—and it had its genesis in an election day visit by Schmidt to Chicago.","From election day to startup","As the internal polling numbers rolled in, the boiler room full of campaign staff and White House aides also included a tech executive: Schmidt, whose financial support and advice to the campaign made him an unofficial fixture. With the campaign drawing to its victorious conclusion, Schmidt was shifting into another mode: Talent-hunter and startup funder.","AP Photo/Charles Dharapak","Schmidt and Obama at a White House meeting in 2009.","When the campaign’s analytics team declared victory at 2pm—hours before voting ended—by comparing early results to their model, its chief Dan Wagner recalls that Schmidt walked up to him and asked two questions: “Who are you? And what algorithms are you using?”","Wagner helped develop the Obama team’s ground-breaking approach to analytics in 2008, and made further refinements in 2012. But he says it was Schmidt who saw the commercial potential for the project—not just for political campaigns, but as a way to help private-sector companies decide how to effectively allocate their marketing budgets.","“I didn’t have any commercial intentions for anything, I was just trying to survive and elect Barack Obama,” Wagner says.","Nevertheless, immediately after the election, Schmidt backed Wagner and other members of his campaign team by becoming the sole investor in Civis Analytics, their data startup. Schmidt also invested in cir.cl, a social shopping startup run by Obama 2012 alumnus Carol Davidsen, who played a key role in the creation of Optimizer. (If you’re keeping score, that makes three Schmidt-funded startups run by ex-Obama staffers: Civis Analytics, cir.cl, and the Groundwork.)","What Wagner’s team built during the campaign, despite its innovativeness, was fairly clunky. “The thing that we built was pretty much a piece of junk, made of plywood in our garage,” Wagner says.","That’s because analyzing giant troves of data, knitting together disparate databases, and making it all work seamlessly is a tricky business, especially under the low-resource, high-pressure conditions of a presidential campaign. Building that tech infrastructure requires the most expensive kind of engineering talent, working under punishing time constraints. For Obama’s 2012 team, Slaby hired a developer named Harper Reed to serve as the campaign’s chief technology officer and build the campaign’s tech underpinnings.","Now Clinton’s campaign needs to build that infrastructure for themselves—or, even better, have a company like the Groundwork help build it for them. This time around, Schmidt backed the startup before the campaign even started.","Like Salesforce.com, for politics","So what does the Groundwork do? The company and Clinton’s campaign are understandably leery of disclosing details.","According to campaign finance disclosures, Clinton’s campaign is the Groundwork’s only political client. Its employees are mostly back-end software developers with experience at blue-chip tech firms like Netflix, Dreamhost, and Google.","Google","Clinton and Schmidt at a 2014 Google event, just days after the Groundwork was incorporated.","The firm was formed in June 2014, shortly after Clinton released a memoir about her time as US secretary of state and began a media blitz that signaled her intent to run for president—including an appearance with Schmidt at Google headquarters—though she did not officially announce her run until the spring of 2015.","Democratic political operatives and technologists said that the Groundwork’s focus is on building a platform that can perform the critical functions of modern campaigning.","These sources tell Quartz that the Groundwork has been tasked with building the technological infrastructure to ingest massive amounts of information about voters, and develop tools that will help the campaign target them for fundraising, advertising, outreach, and get-out-the-vote efforts—essentially to create a political version of a customer relationship management (CRM) system, like the one that Salesforce.com runs for commerce, but for prospective voters.","“They are a technology platform company, not all that dissimilar from a Blue State Digital,” a Clinton campaign staffer told Quartz. Blue State grew out of Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential run and has become a cornerstone technology contractor for the Democratic Party and allied groups. “They provide a suite of services, donation, forum builders, things like that.”","The range of tasks anticipated for this platform—including volunteer coordination, fundraising, social-media marketing and events—makes it seem like the spiritual heir of the platform that Reed’s team built to integrate the Obama campaign’s various vendors, tools and data sources, which was called Narwhal.","That kind of database integration and number crunching may not sound terribly exciting. But building a list is the foundation of any campaign, and doing so digitally, with analytics and communications tools scaling across a nationwide campaign—with hundreds of paid staff and tens of thousands of volunteers—is no easy job, even for experienced engineers.","And it is an essential one for modern-day campaigns. The Romney campaign’s attempt to build a tool to compete with Narwhal (they named it Orca, the Narwhal’s natural enemy) famously fell apart on election day.","No Drama…Clinton?","Hillary Clinton’s last presidential run, like many ultimately unsuccessful campaigns, was hobbled by infighting among her consultants and staff. Even in the “no-drama Obama” 2012 team, the team had its own conflicts, with the engineers charged with building digital tools butting heads with staff charged with the campaign’s digital strategy.","“Who’s going to say, ‘Hey, billionaire smartest tech guy on the planet, thanks but no thanks?’”","Veterans of Obama’s campaign say Clinton’s hierarchy under campaign manager Robbie Mook is better organized to avoid such conflicts this time around, with chief digital strategist Teddy Goff over-seeing both the digital director Katie Dowd and Hannon, the highly regarded former Google executive.","“Hiring Steph may have been Hillary’s sharpest move to date,” says venture capitalist and Democratic fundraiser Chris Sacca, who tells Quartz she is “one of the most gifted and diligent technologists I have ever worked with.”","One source says Hannon is trying to reduce the campaign’s reliance on the Groundwork. But Schmidt’s stature in Silicon Valley, and his status as a major Clinton backer, may complicate any efforts to constrain the Groundwork’s involvement, and distort the typical balance of power between the campaign and a key vendor.","“Imagine you’re a mid-level person inside the campaign, or even the campaign manager,” one veteran Democratic operative says. “Who’s going to say, ‘Hey, billionaire smartest tech guy on the planet, thanks but no thanks?’”","Are startups the new Super PACs?","Today, corporations and wealthy donors have many ways to seek influence with politicians. While their donations to campaigns are limited to a maximum of $5,000 or hundreds of thousands to national party committees, they can also now set up Super PACs with unlimited money for political activities, so long as they don’t coordinate with the official campaigns.","That unlimited money is all well and good for many things a campaign needs—TV advertising, for example, and even field work. But if you want to help make a campaign more tech-savvy, it gets harder: a super PAC, nominally independent under byzantine campaign finance laws, can’t pay for tech infrastructure.","“Your world class skills are worth less because you’re doing it for a good cause.”","That’s the beauty of the Groundwork: Instead of putting money behind a Super PAC that can’t coordinate with the campaign, a well-connected donor like Schmidt can fund a startup to do top-grade work for a campaign, with the financial outlay structured as an investment, not a donation.","Schmidt, a major political donor, did not give money to Clinton’s campaign in the first half of this year, though a campaign official says he has visited the campaign’s Brooklyn headquarters and is supportive of her candidacy.","With tech policy an increasingly important part of the president’s job—consider merely the issues of NSA surveillance and anti-trust policy, not to mention self-driving cars and military robots—helping to elect yet another president could be incredibly valuable to Schmidt and to Google.","And Schmidt’s largesse is not something that other candidates, either rival Democrats like Bernie Sanders or the crowded field of Republicans, will be able to easily match. The billionaire Alphabet executive chairman now boasts a growing track record for funding politically-minded tech startups. The jobs these create could make it easier to attract top engineers to political work without asking them to sacrifice pay and equity for a brief campaign sabbatical.","Slaby says that Groundwork and Timshel exist in part to help talented, highly in-demand engineers work for a larger purpose without having to totally abandon their compensation expectations.","“We’ve institutionalized this idea that if people are going to work on things that are important to them, they’re going to take a big pay cut—your world class skills are worth less because you’re doing it for a good cause,” says Slaby. “At the end of the day people crave purpose. But you also want to pay your mortgage and send your kids to college. That’s an unfortunate choice we put to people a lot of the time.”","But the Groundwork’s success in 2016 will not ultimately be judged on its prospects as a startup, but whether it helps to make Clinton the 45th president of the United States of America.","“Something I always say is, ‘You get zero votes for innovation,’” Goff, Clinton’s top digital staffer, tells Quartz. “If you do something innovative that gets you votes, that’s good … If you do something innovative and it doesn’t get you votes but a VC would like it, we don’t care.”"],"isopubdate":"2015-10-09"}

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.","(CNN)We were lulled into submission early Friday night. All week President Donald Trump had raised the possibility there would be major personnel changes in the White House: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had already been fired by tweet earlier in the week, but the rumors -- egged on by Trump himself -- were swirling that there would be other \"You're Fireds.\"","By close of business, it seemed the weekend would begin with a whimper.","In the course of a few hours, that all changed. Three stories broke that upended the Trump presidency and America's sense of stability. First, attorneys for the President himself joined an effort to stop porn star Stormy Daniels from exposing her alleged affair with Trump and sought $20 million in potential damages. Second, the attorney general fired former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe less than two days before his retirement, arguing that based on the findings of an internal FBI investigation he had lied about communications with the media -- an allegation McCabe denies. And, third, The New York Times and the Observer of London posted an in-depth analysis about how Cambridge Analytica, a firm with ties to Trump's campaign, utilized data from 50 million Facebook users to target voters.","In short, the weekend can be summarized by power, sex and data. But they are not distinct stories. All three fit into a coherent narrative, united by a single theme: The President benefits from systems that, at best, twist the rules, and he does not take kindly to efforts to expose that fact. He seeks to gain the glory of someone else's bad dealings -- saying there was no Trump campaign collusion with Russia, putting the onus of silencing Daniels on his lawyer Michael Cohen or passively benefiting from Cambridge Analytica's efforts.","And while all the political attention is on the McCabe firing (and the Mueller threats), and all the gossip is about the Stormy Daniels saga, it is actually the Facebook scandal that may be the biggest story. Simply put, Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign, is now known to have used the data of millions of Facebook users to target voters for fake news and Trump-related propaganda.","Read More","And though Cambridge Analytica has long denied any connection to the Russians, New York Times reporting suggests otherwise. Lukoil, Russia's oil giant, had contact with Cambridge Analytica in 2014 and 2015, according to company documents and interviews. More specifically, the oil company was reportedly interested in how data could be used to reach the American electorate, according to two former employees. Lukoil denies these talks were \"political in nature.\"","Cambridge Analytica has now been booted from the platform, a face-saving move by Facebook in light of the damning stories, but there is a growing call in Europe and the United States for Facebook to explain how it allowed this to happen.","And to make matters worse, the Wall Street Journal has reported that Cambridge Analytica has become the focus of information inquiries by Robert Mueller. Mueller's indictments against Russians and their involvement in the 2016 election mentioned the manipulation of Facebook a dozen times. Mueller's data request is now reportedly focused on how and whether Cambridge Analytica gamed the system and what, if any, ties to Russia and the Trump campaign it had at that point.","View these three stories across a continuum. The Trump campaign hires a company that used data to get information to target voters; as Trump locked in the GOP nomination and he headed toward Election Day, Trump's lawyer felt he needed to silence a porn star who might expose Trump's alleged affair; and investigations about the campaign led Trump to try to intimidate the FBI and suggest the firing of a senior official investigating his conduct.","It is fair to ask at this point whether what motivates the President has less to do with our national interest and more to do with his legal defense strategies. Why? Because if Trump is willing to have a scorched earth attitude to keep secrets -- what does Daniels know, what does McCabe know, what does Cambridge Analytica know -- then he is susceptible to manipulation by those who may not have America's best interests in mind.","And it is why those who have spent careers defending America seemed to reach a breaking point this weekend. Former Director of the CIA John Brennan called Trump a \"disgraced demagogue.\" And four star Gen. Barry McCaffrey went straight to the point: \"Reluctantly I have concluded that the President is a serious threat to US national security. ... It is apparent that he is for some unknown reasons under the sway of Mr. Putin.\"","It's a shocking statement by McCaffrey, largely because it was uttered by someone who isn't prone to conspiracy theories.","McCabe and Daniels have a pretty sophisticated media and legal strategy, and so their stories will continue to get attention. But keep focused on Cambridge Analytica, as the news stories provide an exhaustive account of tactics used and data manipulated to help Trump become President. And Trump's behavior since Friday night suggests he will use every tool imaginable to remain so."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said.","He said “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Related Coverage","$6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica.","“Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign.","He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people.

An email came to my inbox with a link to download the information. It does expire though, so you need to download your data soon after.","The data comes as a compressed .zip file. If you're on an Apple computer, just double-click it to unzip it. You'll be left with a bunch of folders like these. Kinda scary looking right? Thankfully Facebook designed them as mini HTML webpages, so it's pretty easy to get around.","Start by opening up the file called “index.htm.” It will open what looks like a mini-profile page in your internet browser. The index already gives away a lot of information about you, including your registration date, relationship status (plus your previous ones!), family, education, and employers. This is all information that you've told Facebook before.","(Business Insider)","Let's start with a trip down memory lane. Facebook keeps track of your entire timeline history. Back when I joined Facebook in 2006, it still showed status updates like “Biz is ....” My first status update was apparently to tell people I was just “at home” followed by a smiley two hours later.","When you download your data, you get a copy of every photo and video you've uploaded to Facebook. If you open the photos webpage, you can see all the meta data Facebook stores with each one. It keeps track of when you took the photo, where you took the photo, and your IP address when you uploaded it.","(Business Insider)","Facebook even has my “Facial Recognition Data” on file. The three thresholds mean nothing to me, but apparently Facebook has 237 examples of what I look like on file.","I can already easily tell who all my friends are on Facebook, but the company also keeps track of the friends I've removed over the last 10 years. Unfortunately, I can't tell who removed me from their friends list. The other odd designation? Facebook keeps track of what it calls your “friend peer group” — mine is classified (accurately) as \"Starting Adult Life\".","The next stage for Facebook?","And in case you need a look back on your social calendar, Facebook keeps a record of all the events you've attended. Not a bad idea if you need to look up an old address or date (or be reminded of your high-school prom).","It also has a copy of all of your Facebook messages — although it's much easier to access those through your normal Facebook account than through the data download.","Under ads, Facebook tracks what it thinks you're interested in AND the ads you've clicked on. It only holds ad info on what you've clicked on for a short time, so it's not your total history. As for its ad topics, I have no idea how it came up with half of these interests (Monarchy of the United Kingdom?? Crust Geology??), nor does the data tell me.","Remember Pokes?

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly “legitimate way and through proper channels” when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie.","Kogan’s app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal continued. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.

When they met the following day, she led him down a hallway praising his performance. However, when she opened the door to a meeting room, he came face to face with members of Facebook’s secretive “rat-catching” team, led by the company’s head of investigations, Sonya Ahuja.","The interrogation was a technicality; they already knew he was guilty of leaking some innocuous information to the press. They had records of a screenshot he’d taken, links he had clicked or hovered over, and they strongly indicated they had accessed chats between him and the journalist, dating back to before he joined the company.","Contact the Guardian securely","Read more","“It’s horrifying how much they know,” he told the Guardian, on the condition of anonymity. “You go into Facebook and it has this warm, fuzzy feeling of ‘we’re changing the world’ and ‘we care about things’. But you get on their bad side and all of a sudden you are face to face with [Facebook CEO] Mark Zuckerberg’s secret police.”","The public image of Silicon Valley’s tech giants is all colourful bicycles, ping-pong tables, beanbags and free food, but behind the cartoonish facade is a ruthless code of secrecy. They rely on a combination of Kool-Aid, digital and physical surveillance, legal threats and restricted stock units to prevent and detect intellectual property theft and other criminal activity. However, those same tools are also used to catch employees and contractors who talk publicly, even if it’s about their working conditions, misconduct or cultural challenges within the company.","Zuckerberg hosts weekly meetings where he shares details of unreleased new products and strategies in front of thousands of employees. Even junior staff members and contractors can see what other teams are working on by looking at one of many of the groups on the company’s internal version of Facebook.","“When you first get to Facebook you are shocked at the level of transparency. You are trusted with a lot of stuff you don’t need access to,” said Evans, adding that during his induction he was warned not to look at ex-partners’ Facebook accounts.","“The counterbalance to giving you this huge trusting environment is if anyone steps out of line, they’ll squash you like a bug.”","The Google campus in Mountain View, California. The company has been sued for using overly broad confidentiality agreements and getting employees to spy on each other. Photograph: JasonDoiy/Getty Images","During one of Zuckerberg’s weekly meetings in 2015, after word of its new messaging assistant spread, the usually affable CEO warned employees: “We’re going to find the leaker, and we’re going to fire them.” A week later came the public shaming: Zuck revealed the culprit had been caught and fired. People at the meeting applauded.","“Companies routinely use business records in workplace investigations, and we are no exception,” said a Facebook spokeswoman, Bertie Thomson.","It’s a similar story at Google. Staff use an internal version of Google Plus and thousands of mailing lists to discuss everything from homeownership to items for sale, as well as social issues like neoconservatism and diversity. With the exception of James Damore’s explosive memo about gender and tech, most of it doesn’t leak.","By and large, staff buy into the corporate mission in a happy-clappy campus which helps foster a tribal mentality that discourages treachery. Employees are also rewarded with annual allocations of restricted stock that can buy silence for years after leaving.","“You would never do something that screws up the company’s chance of success because you are directly affected by it,” said a former Googler Justin Maxwell, who noted the pressure to behave in a “Googley” way.","The search engine’s former head of investigations, Brian Katz, highlighted this in 2016 in a company-wide email titled: “Internal only. Really.”","“If you’re considering sharing confidential information to a reporter – or to anyone externally – for the love of all that’s Googley, please reconsider! Not only could it cost you your job, but it also betrays the values that makes [sic] us a community,” he wrote.","This email came to light after another former employee sued Google for its overzealous approach to preventing leaks using overly broad confidentiality agreements and getting employees to spy on and report each other. The legal complaint alleges that Google’s policies violate labour laws that allow employees to discuss workplace conditions, wages and potential legal violations inside the company. Both parties are scheduled to enter mediation later this year.","James Damore, the software engineer who was fired from Google after writing a controversial memo questioning diversity programmes, suspects he was being monitored by the company during his final days.","He also described “weird things” happening to his work phone and laptop after the memo went viral. “All the internal apps updated at the same time, which had never happened before. I had to re-sign in to my Google account on both devices and my Google Drive – where the document was – stopped working.”","Damore said that much of the spying capabilities were outlined in his contract and that it was mostly “necessary” for a company that gives “everyone access to secret things”.","After he was fired, Damore stopped using his personal Gmail account in favour of Yahoo email out of fear that Google might be spying on him. “My lawyer doesn’t think they are above doing that,” he said.","However, a Google spokeswoman said the company never reads personal email accounts and denied spying on Damore’s devices.","“I wouldn’t expect them to admit to it,” Damore said.","Since Damore’s memo, Google has become much leakier, particularly around internal discussions of racial and gender diversity.","“It’s a cry for help internally,” said another former Googler, who now runs a startup.","He said people at Google had for years put up with covert sexism, internal biases or, in his case, a manager with anger management problems. “No one would do anything until one day a VP saw the guy yelling at me in the hallway.","“People have been dealing with this stuff for years and are finally thinking ‘if Google isn’t going to do something about it, we’re going to leak it’.”","Everyone was paranoid. When we texted each other, we’d use code if we needed to talk about work","For low-paid contractors who do the grunt work for big tech companies, the incentive to keep silent is more stick than carrot. What they lack in stock options and a sense of corporate tribalism, they make up for in fear of losing their jobs.","One European Facebook content moderator signed a contract, seen by the Guardian, which granted the company the right to monitor and record his social media activities, including his personal Facebook account, as well as emails, phone calls and internet use. He also agreed to random personal searches of his belongings including bags, briefcases and car while on company premises. Refusal to allow such searches would be treated as gross misconduct.","Following Guardian reporting into working conditions of community operations analysts at Facebook’s European headquarters in Dublin, the company clamped down further, he said.","Contractors would be questioned if they took photographs in the office or printed emails or documents. “On more than one occasion someone would print something and you’d find management going through the log to see what they had printed,” said one former worker.","Security teams would leave “mouse traps” – USB keys containing data that were left around the office to test staff loyalty. “If you find a USB or something you’d have to give it in straight away. If you plugged it into a computer it would throw up a flare and you’d be instantly escorted out of the building.”","“Everyone was paranoid. When we texted each other we’d use code if we needed to talk about work and meet up in person to talk about it in private,” he said.","Some employees switch their phones off or hide them out of fear that their location is being tracked. One current Facebook employee who recently spoke to Wired asked the reporter to turn off his phone so the company would have a harder time tracking if it had been near the phones of anyone from Facebook.","James Damore stopped using his personal Gmail account after being fired, due to fears Google was spying on him. Photograph: Winni Wintermeyer for the Guardian","Two security researchers confirmed that this would be technically simple for Facebook to do if both people had the Facebook app on their phone and location services switched on. Even if location services aren’t switched on, Facebook can infer someone’s location from wifi access points.","“We do not use cellphones to track employee locations, nor do we track locations of people who do not work at Facebook, including reporters,” said Thomson.","Companies will also hire external agencies to surveil their staff. One such firm, Pinkerton, counts Google and Facebook among its clients.","Among other services, Pinkerton offers to send investigators to coffee shops or restaurants near a company’s campus to eavesdrop on employees’ conversations.","Big data for the people: it's time to take it back from our tech overlords","Read more","“If we hear anything about a new product coming, or new business ventures or something to do with stocks, we’ll feed that information back to corporate security,” said David Davari, a managing director at the firm, adding that the focus is usually IP theft or insider trading.","Facebook and Google both deny using this service.","Through LinkedIn searches, the Guardian found several former Pinkerton investigators to have subsequently been hired by Facebook, Google and Apple.","“These tools are common, widespread, intrusive and legal,” said Al Gidari, consulting director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.","“Companies are required to take steps to detect and deter criminal misconduct, so it’s not surprising they are using the same tools to make sure employees are in compliance with their contractual obligations.”","This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But Silicon Valley isn't having it | Technology | The Guardian","text":["Californians protest about the inauguration of Donald Trump. The tech community, which skews liberal, has spoken out against proposals such as a Muslim registry.\nPhotograph: James Lawler Duggan/Reuters","Last week, something unusual happened in Silicon Valley. Dozens of tech workers stood in the rain in downtown Palo Alto and staged a protest. They held signs and chanted slogans outside the headquarters of Palantir, the $20bn data-analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel, one of Donald Trump’s closest advisers.","'Call me': Donald Trump woos tech leaders at New York meeting","Read more","Palantir builds software that helps various federal agencies track and deport Americans.It’s poised to profit handily from the incoming administration, given Thiel’s central role in the transition team and Trump’s desire to create a Muslim registry and accelerate mass deportations. That rainy day in Palo Alto, the protesters made a simple demand: Palantir should refuse to help Trump enact his agenda.","They’re not alone. The Palantir protest is part of a rising tide of resistance organized by tech workers in the weeks since the election. They represent a powerful weapon in the fight against Trump: a bloc with the economic power and technical expertise to disrupt the new president’s long-promised campaign of domestic repression. They’re determined to stop their companies from collaborating with the incoming administration – and they might just transform the tech industry in the process.","Not long ago, the prospect of Silicon Valley teaming up with Trump seemed absurd. With the notable exception of Thiel, tech leaders overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton and blasted Trump as a dangerous bigot. After the election, however, they abruptly reversed course. Since 8 November, they’ve treated Trump to a constant stream of conciliation and flattery. When Trump seemed certain to lose, denouncing him carried no cost; now that he’s in the White House, even mild criticism is evidently too risky. After all, antagonizing the most powerful man in America might be bad for business. It might even jeopardize the kind of lucrative government contracts that make Palantir’s investors rich.","Fortunately, tech workers don’t share their bosses’ politics. During the Democratic presidential primaries, while Silicon Valley CEOs were throwing $50,000-a-plate fundraisers for Clinton, their employees were pouring money into the Bernie Sanders campaign. Now, with tech leaders swiftly capitulating to Trump, tech workers are building a rank-and-file movement against Trumpism.","One of the loudest voices in this movement belongs to Maciej Ceglowski, a Polish-American developer and entrepreneur. Ceglowski has long enjoyed a loyal following for his sharp insider critiques of Silicon Valley. Since the election, he has emerged as a withering critic of the tech industry’s rapid accommodation to the new administration. He is also the main force behind Tech Solidarity, a new group that has become the leading hub for tech organizing against Trump.","With tech leaders swiftly capitulating to Trump, tech workers are building a rank-and-file movement against Trumpism","The first meeting of Tech Solidarity took place in San Francisco on 28 November. Since then, they’ve expanded to Boston, New York, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, and Washington DC. The meetings aren’t entirely public – to obtain an invitation, attendees must contact Ceglowski via email or the encrypted messaging service Signal. Crucially, participants are asked not to disclose the identity of anyone else in attendance. This promise of anonymity is indispensable for fostering candid conversations among tech workers, who tend to be heavily bound by nondisclosure agreements.","These gatherings are already proving to be important incubators for grassroots initiatives. The inaugural Tech Solidarity meeting in San Francisco helped produce the Never Again pledge, a public declaration by tech workers that they will refuse to build a database identifying people by race, religion, or national origin. The pledge went live on 13 December – the day before Silicon Valley’s top executives made the pilgrimage to Trump Tower to sit down for a summit with the president-elect.","The organizers of the pledge are keenly aware of their industry’s history. The Never Again site refers to IBM’s well-documented role in providing the punch-card machines that streamlined the Holocaust – a history the company has never fully acknowledged or apologized for. Which makes it all the more chilling that IBM has gone out of its way to court Trump since his victory. Days after the election, IBM’s CEO, Ginni Rometty, wrote a congratulatory letter to the president-elect personally offering her company’s services to his administration.","Many tech workers are disgusted by such sycophancy – and afraid of what it might lead to. To date, the Never Again pledge has gathered almost three thousand signatures, with employees from nearly every major tech company represented. It played a key role in forcing several big tech firms to finally promise not to build a Muslim registry, after weeks of silence and equivocation on the subject.","Ginni Rometty, chairman and CEO of IBM, wrote a letter to Trump after his victory offering her company’s services. Photograph: Ruben Sprich/Reuters","But the word of a corporate spokesperson isn’t worth much. And the pledge itself, while immensely valuable as an organizing tool, is hard to uphold in practice. An engineer can vow not to build tools for Trump, but making good on that promise will be difficult. She often won’t know how the software she’s writing will be used, much less whether it’ll be used for purposes she disagrees with. And even if she does discover that she’s coding some contrivance of Trumpist repression, she probably won’t be able to stop its development. She can quit, or take the courageous step of becoming a whistleblower, but she has little chance of halting her company’s collusion with the administration all by herself.","This is why collective action is critical. When I reached Ceglowski by email, he said building a tech workers’ union is the next step. “I’m focusing all my energy on unionizing right now,” he wrote. A union might seem like an odd choice for tech workers, who already enjoy high salaries and good benefits. But it’s precisely this leverage that would make a tech union so powerful. Unionized tech workers could flex their collective muscle in a way that, say, low-paid and precarious fast-food workers couldn’t.","We could’ve avoided President Donald Trump. Now, we must learn the lessons | Rebecca Solnit","Read more","Moreover, tech workers may occupy a privileged position, but there’s no guarantee they’ll do so indefinitely. Now’s the time to unionize, while they still have a good deal of bargaining power. Software engineers like to think of themselves as special, but they’re subject to the same capitalist forces as nurses and auto workers.","If they unionize, tech workers could do more than protect their material interests. They could also determine the future of their industry. For too long, the Musks and Ellisons and Zuckerbergs have dominated the discourse and set the agenda. A unionized tech sector might push Silicon Valley in a different direction, with its workers standing up for the public interest on issues like surveillance, data monopolies, and the corporate domination of the digital sphere. If that happens, then the catastrophe of Trump’s election will have yielded at least one good result – and the tech executives who appeased him will have paid a heavy price."],"isopubdate":"2017-01-24"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","On Sunday morning, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment to the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. It has said previously that the company has made changes to privacy policies to prevent similar data loss without explicit consent from users.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 presidential race — have intensified. He has authored blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as General Counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","The company also has worked hard in recent days to cast the data collection by people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica as not a “breach” because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Her friend Linda Leonhart agrees: “I will definitely take a look to see who has the courage to take on a job like this and do what needs to be done.”CreditCreditAllison V. Smith for The New York Times","By Michael Tackett","March 11, 2018","GRAPEVINE, Tex. — Carol Rains, a white evangelical Christian, has no regrets over her vote for President Trump. She likes most of his policies and would still support him over any Democrat. But she is open to another Republican.","“I would like for someone to challenge him,” Ms. Rains said, as she sipped wine recently with two other evangelical Christian women at a suburban restaurant north of Dallas. “But it needs to be somebody that’s strong enough to go against the Democrats.” Her preferred alternative: Nikki R. Haley, the United Nations ambassador and former South Carolina governor.","One of her friends, Linda Leonhart, agreed. “I will definitely take a look to see who has the courage to take on a job like this and do what needs to be done,” she said.","According to data from the Pew Research Center, support among white evangelical women in recent surveys has dropped about 13 percentage points, to 60 percent, compared with about a year ago. That is even greater than the eight-point drop among all women.","“That change is statistically significant,” said Gregory A. Smith, Pew’s associate director of research, who also noted a nine-point drop among evangelical men. “Both groups have become less approving over time.”","If that drop in support translates into a lack of enthusiasm among core Trump supporters in the midterm elections in November, as it did for many of President Barack Obama’s voters in 2010, the Republican Party could be more vulnerable in its efforts to maintain control of Congress. In 2020, it would also possibly open a lane for a primary challenger to the president.","The women in suburban Dallas all conceded they have cringed sometimes at Mr. Trump, citing his pettiness, impulsiveness, profanity and name calling. Still, they defended him because he delivered on issues they cared most about, such as the appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.","“Certainly we are all embarrassed, but for the most part he represents what we stand for,” said Ms. Leonhart, who is active in the women’s ministry at her church.","A clear majority of white evangelical women, even in the face of the #MeToo movement and renewed claims of marital infidelity against the president, continue, along with white evangelical men, to form Mr. Trump’s most cohesive block of support.","Mr. Trump’s ability to connect so strongly with evangelical voters was among the most notable surprises of the 2016 campaign. Since his election, he has courted evangelical leaders aggressively and, more important, has delivered on promises to appoint conservatives like Justice Gorsuch to federal courts. Men who see themselves as leaders of religious conservatives, such as Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell Jr. and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, have remained doggedly supportive.","And the majority of evangelical women remain in his corner.","But it has not been easy.","“I don’t know any evangelical woman who is going to defend the character of the president,” said Carmen Fowler LaBerge, host of “The Reconnect,” an evangelical-centered radio show.","“Many things the president says and does are things that many evangelicals use as examples with our kids of what we should not do,” added Ms. LaBerge, who did not support Mr. Trump in 2016. “This is not who we are as evangelicals. This is not how we treat people.”","Some evangelical women simply keep their views private. Gathered at a well-appointed home in Falls Church, Va., last week, eight Christian women agreed to talk about their feelings about the president, on one condition: that they not be identified.","They feared reprisal in the workplace, at their children’s schools, even at their church. They meet in secret and have a private Facebook group, which its organizer said has about 160 members, to talk about their support for Mr. Trump.","They said that Christian voters who backed Trump had been derided as unthinking, unsophisticated hypocrites, but for many of them that only affirmed their resolve. One of the women said that her parents had come to the United States illegally from El Salvador and that she was born a short time later. Her father is now a citizen. She supports Mr. Trump and his hard-line plans on immigration.","“I would say that this year has only made me more of a certain supporter,” said another of the women, Joanna, who agreed to be identified only by her first name. “I’ve been really excited to see him come through with his promises, one by one, against incredible odds.”","Still, there is a tension among evangelical women. They said they largely cast their votes against Hillary Clinton more than for Mr. Trump.","“At least in my experience, it was more of an anti-Hillary vote than a pro-Trump vote,” Ms. LaBerge said.","Karen Swallow Prior, a professor at Liberty University who opposed Mr. Trump and voted for a third-party candidate, said, “Now that Trump is in office and we are evaluating his performance then, I am glad to see that people are less in lock step and thinking critically about him as a leader, and it doesn’t surprise me that his overall support would decline from 80 percent.”","“I was one of those culture war evangelicals in the ’80s and ’90s,” Ms. Swallow Prior said. “I was appalled by the candidacy and presidency of Bill Clinton. It was hammered into my mind that character mattered, and that did change when Trump came along. In some ways, I felt betrayed by my evangelical peers who taught me and cemented in me the idea that character matters. I didn’t abandon that belief. I feel like some evangelicals did.”","Evangelical voters, often portrayed as a monolith, are becoming increasingly difficult to define. The support for Mr. Trump reflects a growing pragmatism among evangelical voters who are willing to accept a less than ideal model of Christian faith in exchange for policies that they endorse.","“I think they’ve become experienced and very practical,” said Frances FitzGerald, the author of the recent book “The Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America.” “By large majorities they used to believe that to be elected, you had to be of good character. No longer. It’s ‘We want a president to do what we want him to do, and he’s going to do it if we turn out and vote.’”","Mr. Trump also appeals to white evangelicals in other ways with his strong language, disruptive view of presidential norms and his policies on taxes. “Religious right rhetoric has always been very martial — isolationist and martial at the same time,” Ms. FitzGerald said.","In surveys conducted by LifeWay Research in Nashville, evangelical voters in 2016 cited the economy (30 percent) and national security (26 percent) as their top two issues. Abortion was cited by just 4 percent, said Scott McConnell, the company’s executive director.","Evangelical voters began to emerge as a political force with their support for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and became a more coherent movement with the 1988 presidential campaign of the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and the rise of Christian Coalition. But there are now few obvious leaders of religious conservatism, and voters have become more conventional in their assessment of candidates.","And even among religious conservatives, the Pew poll suggests tolerance for Mr. Trump has its limits.","“It may simply be that there’s not a single breaking point as much as a tipping point, the ‘Oh Lord, I can’t stand another one of these,’” said William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University and author of “With God on Our Side,” which charted the political rise of the religious right.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: White Evangelical Women, Core Trump Supporters, Are Tiptoeing Away.

{"originalurl":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/new-backdoor-around-fourth-amendment-cloud-act","title":"A New Backdoor Around the Fourth Amendment: The CLOUD Act | Electronic Frontier Foundation","text":["A New Backdoor Around the Fourth Amendment: The CLOUD Act","There’s a new, proposed backdoor to our data, which would bypass our Fourth Amendment protections to communications privacy. It is built into a dangerous bill called the CLOUD Act, which would allow police at home and abroad to seize cross-border data without following the privacy rules where the data is stored.","This backdoor is an insidious method for accessing our emails, our chat logs, our online videos and photos, and our private moments shared online between one another. This backdoor would deny us meaningful judicial review and the privacy protections embedded in our Constitution.","This new backdoor for cross-border data mirrors another backdoor under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, an invasive NSA surveillance authority for foreign intelligence gathering. That law, recently reauthorized and expanded by Congress for another six years, gives U.S. intelligence agencies, including the NSA, FBI, and CIA, the ability to search, read, and share our private electronic messages without first obtaining a warrant.","The new backdoor in the CLOUD Act operates much in the same way. U.S. police could obtain Americans’ data, and use it against them, without complying with the Fourth Amendment.","The CLOUD Act (S. 2383 and H.R. 4943) has two major components. First, it empowers U.S. law enforcement to grab data stored anywhere in the world, without following foreign data privacy rules. Second, it empowers the president to unilaterally enter executive agreements with any nation on earth, even known human rights abusers. Under such executive agreements, foreign law enforcement officials could grab data stored in the United States, directly from U.S. companies, without following U.S. privacy rules like the Fourth Amendment, so long as the foreign police are not targeting a U.S. person or a person in the United States.","That latter component is where the CLOUD Act’s backdoor lives.","When foreign police use their power under CLOUD Act executive agreements to collect a foreign target’s data from a U.S. company, they might also collect data belonging to a non-target U.S. person who happens to be communicating with the foreign target. Within the numerous, combined foreign investigations allowed under the CLOUD Act, it is highly likely that related seizures will include American communications, including email, online chat, video calls, and internet voice calls.","Under the CLOUD Act’s rules for these data demands from foreign police to U.S. service providers, this collection of Americans’ data can happen without any prior, individualized review by a foreign or American judge. Also, it can happen without the foreign police needing to prove the high level of suspicion required by the U.S. Fourth Amendment: probable cause.","Once the foreign police have collected Americans’ data, they often will be able to hand it over to U.S. law enforcement, which can use it to investigate Americans, and ultimately to bring criminal charges against them in the United States.","According to the bill, foreign police can share the content of a U.S person’s communications with U.S. authorities so long as it “relates to significant harm, or the threat thereof, to the United States or United States persons.” This nebulous standard is vague and overbroad. Also, the bill’s hypotheticals indicate far-ranging data sharing by foreign police with U.S. authorities. From national security to violent crime, from organized crime to financial fraud, the CLOUD Act permits it all to be shared, and likely far more.","Moreover, the CLOUD Act allows the foreign police who collect Americans’ communications to freely use that content against Americans, and to freely share it with additional nations.","To review: The CLOUD Act allows the president to enter an executive agreement with a foreign nation known for human rights abuses. Using its CLOUD Act powers, police from that nation inevitably will collect Americans’ communications. They can share the content of those communications with the U.S. government under the flawed “significant harm” test. The U.S. government can use that content against these Americans. A judge need not approve the data collection before it is carried out. At no point need probable cause be shown. At no point need a search warrant be obtained.","This is wrong. Much like the infamous backdoor search loophole connected to broad, unconstitutional NSA surveillance under Section 702, the backdoor proposed in the CLOUD Act violates our Fourth Amendment right to privacy by granting unconstitutional access to our private lives online.","Also, when foreign police using their CLOUD Act powers inevitably capture metadata about Americans, they can freely share it with the U.S. government, without even showing “significant harm.” Communications “content” is the words in an email or online chat, the recordings of an internet voice call, or the moving images and coordinating audio of a video call online. Communications “metadata” is the pieces of information that relate to a message, including when it was sent, who sent it, who received it, its duration, and where the sender was located when sending it. Metadata is enormously powerful information and should be treated with the same protection as content.","To be clear: the CLOUD Act fails to provide any limits on foreign police sharing Americans’ metadata with U.S. police.","The CLOUD Act would be a dangerous overreach into our data. It seeks to streamline cross-border police investigations, but it tears away critical privacy protections to attain that goal. This is not a fair trade. It is a new backdoor search loophole around the Fourth Amendment.","Related Updates","The Senate Commerce Committee is getting ready to host a much-anticipated hearing on consumer privacy—and consumer privacy groups don’t get a seat at the table.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Kogan maintains that he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","Facebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor – Kogan’s business partner at the time their company acquired the data, using an app called thisisyourdigitallife.","Cambridge Analytica – a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon – used the data to build sophisticated psychological profiles of US voters.","Facebook’s public statements have omitted any reference to GSR, the company Kogan incorporated in May 2014 with Chancellor, who at the time was a postdoctoral research assistant.","The Guardian asked Facebook several questions about its recruitment of Chancellor and any action it had taken in light of the data harvesting scam conducted by GSR. Facebook initially promised to respond to a set of questions by Sunday, but then said it had nothing to say on the matter. Chancellor did not respond to repeated requests for comment.","The psychologist, who is 38, is understood to have been a junior partner to Kogan, who oversaw GSR’s business dealings and then elicited the help of several of his students. One source with some knowledge of Chancellor’s role at the company described him as “just the data guy”.","However, both Kogan and Chancellor were listed as directors of GSR when it was founded and provided a “service address” in Harley Street, London.","In the months that followed the creation of GSR, the company worked in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica to pay hundreds of thousands ofusers to take the test as part of an agreement in which they agreed for their data to be collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions strong. That data sold to Cambridge Analytica as part of a commercial agreement. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising.","Chancellor resigned his directorship of GSR in September 2015, according to company records. He joined Facebook around November 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile.","The following month, the Guardian published the first story detailing how Kogan and Chancellor’s company had unethically sourced data that was then passed to Cambridge Analytica, which at the time was working for the presidential campaign of Ted Cruz.","Facebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor at that stage. His role at Facebook was mentioned in a story by the Intercept 12 months ago. At that time, Facebook said in a statement: “The work that he did previously has no bearing on the work that he does at Facebook.”","Chancellor, who was conducting postdoctoral research at Cambridge University when GSR was set up, is understood to have been one of several students who Kogan involved in his project.","Data scandal is huge blow for Facebook – and efforts to study its impact on society","Read more","Since joining Facebook, some of Chancellor’s academic research has been published in peer-reviewed journals. However, the precise nature of his work for Facebook is unclear. The company employs many in-house social scientists to conduct research on the psychology of its users.","In 2014, Facebook was revealed to have conducted a vast experiment on users, without their consent, which entailed tweaking the amount of positive and negative content appearing on their feeds to see if the tech giant could manipulate some kind of “emotional contagion”.","Last year, leaked documents revealed how Facebook had told advertisers they had the capacity to monitor posts in real time and identify when teenage users were feeling “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”.","That kind of finite information is invaluable to advertisers – whether selling products or political candidates – as it helps them more effectively tailor and target their message to individual users on the platform.","Facebook’s ability to create granular profiles of its users has been at the very core of its business model, transforming the social media platform into one of the most profitable companies on the planet."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Throughout the last year, every time bad news has broken, executives have downplayed its significance. Look at its public statements last year about how many people had seen Russian-bought election ads — first it was 10 million, then it was 126 million.","Top execs dodged Congress when it was asking questions about Russian interference. They are selling their shares at a record clip.","The actions of Facebook execs now recall how execs at Nokia and Blackberry reacted after the iPhone emerged. Their revenues kept growing for a couple years -- and they dismissed the threats. By the time users started leaving in droves, it was too late.","There's no outside attacker bringing Facebook down. It's a circular firing squad that stems from the company's fundamental business model of collecting data from users, and using that data to sell targeted ads. For years, users went along with the bargain. But after almost a year of constant negative publicity, their patience may be waning.","Facebook did not initially respond to questions or a request for comment from CNBC.","The drumbeat","For more than a year now, Facebook has been deflecting stories about how its platform was used during the 2016 presidential election.","Some of this activity — like Facebook embedding workers with the Trump campaign to tell them how to advertise more effectively — was perfectly legal, and in line with normal business practices. A lot of these tactics would probably have drawn no scrutiny if Donald Trump hadn't surprised everybody by winning an election that all the polls showed him losing.","Other activity was against Facebook's policies, or outright illegal. Most notably, a U.S. grand jury recently indicted 13 Russian nationals for conducting a disinformation campaign on American soil intended to further political divisions in the country and sway the election toward Trump. Their tactics included using Facebook groups to organize divisive political protests and buying targeted ads.","CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has remained aloof throughout the whole sequence of events.","He addresses some of these issues on personal Facebook posts, but seldom talks to the press about them. Last year, he spent most of the year doing photo ops with people around America, but did not show up when Congress asked questions about how the Russians used Facebook to influence the 2016 election.","This year, he announced his annual personal challenge would be fixing Facebook — in other words, doing his job as the CEO of a publicly traded company worth more than $500 billion. In past years, he's taught himself Mandarin and hunted his own food.","The spin","Over the weekend, Facebook gave a case study in how the company reacts inappropriately to negative news.","On Friday night, Facebook made a surprise announcement that the company had suspended a political analytics research firm, Cambridge Analytica. The firm was funded by large Republican donor Robert Mercer, and Trump's campaign used it to target ads on Facebook.","In its Friday post, Facebook claimed it had discovered new evidence that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted data about Facebook users passed to it by a Russian-American researcher, who had collected it through a personality quiz that 270,000 Facebook users took. The data included information like the cities where users lived and what they had \"liked\" on Facebook.","It was against Facebook's terms of use for the researcher to pass the data along. Cambridge Analytica had told Facebook it had deleted the data back in 2015, but Facebook said it had received recent reports to the contrary, according to the blog post.","(Cambridge Analytica has countered the allegations, saying it was in compliance with Facebook's guidelines, and that no data collected through the app was used in the Trump campaign.)","But as is often the case in political scandal, the problem isn't so much the original action, but the cover-up. Or in this case, the spin.","It turns out that Facebook didn't just spontaneously decide to ban the political research firm. It was actually trying to get ahead of two bombshell reports, in the New York Times and The Observer (the Sunday edition of U.K. paper The Guardian). The publications detailed exactly how Cambridge Analytica had collected information about Facebook users in a bid to target them with political messages.","Facebook knew about these news stories for some time. It also appears that the company was trying to squelch the reports.","The Times report claimed that, in private conversations with the newspaper, Facebook \"downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control.\" The Guardian wrote that \"Facebook's external lawyers warned the Observer it was making 'false and defamatory' allegations, and reserved Facebook's legal position.\"","The stories went ahead anyway. Once they were published, Facebook executives immediately took to Twitter to defend the company, insisting that this was not a \"breach.\"","In tweets that were later deleted, Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos called the stories \"important and powerful,\" while insisting that it was \"incorrect to call it a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\" The deleted tweets are preserved below:","So far, more than 24 hours after the stories, Zuckerberg and his number-two, COO Sheryl Sandberg, have not responded.","Missing the point","The Facebook executives who responded are correct — there was no security breach. Users gave their information willingly. Moreover, Facebook has since put better security controls for apps in place, so users can more easily control what information apps are gathering and how they're using it.","But they're missing the point.","Facebook users are slowly learning that almost anybody can use Facebook to collect detailed information about them, and that — at least some of the time — Facebook cannot control where this information flows, or how it is used. Using Facebook is like writing your life story down on a piece of paper, then taping it to a lamppost.","Journalists and privacy advocates may roll their eyes at this \"revelation\" — they've been warning people about Facebook and privacy since its inception.","Users mostly ignored these warnings. They wanted to share photos, connect with old friends, play games, take quizzes and watch videos, and Facebook gave them a simple way to do it. More than 2 billion people around the world now use the 14-year-old service, and Facebook sold nearly $40 billion worth of ads last year.","But things are beginning to change. There's a growing sense that Facebook has become creepy instead of fun.","A lot of people are noticing that the ads on Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram are so precisely targeted, they're sure the company is eavesdropping on their conversations through their phone microphones. (Facebook swears it is not — CNBC's Michelle Castillo has a great explanation of what is probably going on.)","More to the point, people are starting to curb their Facebook usage. In the fourth quarter, for the first time ever, the number of people in North America who used Facebook every day dropped from the previous year.","Also, Zuckerberg told investors on the company's earnings call that the company saw a 5 percent drop in time spent on Facebook during the quarter. The company claimed that this reduced engagement was because of some technical changes that Facebook made to crack down on low-quality content and give users a more positive experience.","These are just two small metrics. Facebook is still growing in many regions and by many other measurements.","But still: Fewer people using Facebook every day in one region, and spending less time on it. That's never happened before.","For the time being, advertisers are grumbling about Facebook and warning their clients to stay away from certain ad products, but they're still putting their money there — with an audience over 2 billion and some of the most accurate ad targeting available, Facebook is still impossible to ignore.","But if usage continues to decline, advertisers will start eventually follow. And there are plenty of hungry smaller competitors — Twitter and Snap, particularly — who would be happy to take some of that money.","Executive stock sales not reassuring","Meanwhile, Facebook executives are not exactly sending a reassuring message to investors by unloading their shares at a rapid clip.","Last summer, after Zuckerberg's plan to create another class of stock to solidify his control of the company foundered, he announced he'd begin selling off up to 75 million shares (about 18 percent of his stake), worth nearly $13 billion, by mid-2019. The money will support the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), his other company devoted to good works.","Why now? Zuckerberg is 33 years old -- far from retirement. What exactly is CZI doing that requires such a massive investment? Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is building rocket ships to explore space with his other company Blue Origin, and he only needs to spend $1 billion a year.","Other top executives are also selling in massive amounts. Jan Koum, who founded the messaging app WhatsApp, which Facebook bought in 2014 for $19 billion, sold $2.8 billion worth of shares last year — more than any exec at any major tech company. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sold $2 billion of stock last year, in part to fund Blue Origin. Nobody else is close.)","Sandberg sold over $300 million, which pales in comparison to her colleagues but is still unusually large among officers of top tech companies.","Facebook stock is up over 80 percent in the last 12 months. Perhaps these execs are just taking gains, as any normal employee with stock compensation would be advised to do.","But these are not normal employees. They're the leaders of the company.","Other leaders keep skin in the game during difficult times -- think of how Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer held on to most of his stock throughout his tenure, even as Microsoft faced expensive antitrust lawsuits and growing competitive threats, or how Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey bought shares in 2017 when many investors had written the company off.","Facebook is facing real problems. Instead of giving answers to those problems, top execs are selling, spinning and staying silent."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Cambridge Analytica was looking for people who were American Facebook users. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz app on Facebook called thisisyourdigitallife.","About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app “scraped” information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends’ profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica.","A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn’t installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.","This weekend, after this was all exposed by The New York Times and The Observer of London, Facebook hastily made a public announcement that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica (well over a year after the election) and vehemently denied that this was a “data breach.” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false.” He contended that Facebook users “knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” He also said that “everyone involved gave their consent.”","Mr. Grewal is right: This wasn’t a breach in the technical sense. It is something even more troubling: an all-too-natural consequence of Facebook’s business model, which involves having people go to the site for social interaction, only to be quietly subjected to an enormous level of surveillance. The results of that surveillance are used to fuel a sophisticated and opaque system for narrowly targeting advertisements and other wares to Facebook’s users.","Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook’s true customers, whom it works hard to please.","Facebook doesn’t just record every click and “like” on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases “external” data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge “offline” data — things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store — with its vast online databases.","Facebook even creates “shadow profiles” of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data. This is an involuntary dossier from which you cannot opt out in the United States.","Despite Facebook’s claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her “consent” — at least not in any meaningful sense of the word. It is true that if you found and read all the fine print on the site, you might have noticed that in 2014, your Facebook friends had the right to turn over all your data through such apps. (Facebook has since turned off this feature.) If you had managed to make your way through a bewildering array of options, you might have even discovered how to turn the feature off.","This wasn’t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.","Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person’s personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook “likes” — and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day?","Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual — especially since it is practically irrevocable.","What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time.","The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company’s operations in the 2016 presidential election.","If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn’t have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn’t free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone’s data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance.","Should we all just leave Facebook? That may sound attractive but it is not a viable solution. In many countries, Facebook and its products simply are the internet. Some employers and landlords demand to see Facebook profiles, and there are increasingly vast swaths of public and civic life — from volunteer groups to political campaigns to marches and protests — that are accessible or organized only via Facebook.","The problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests?","A business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability.","Zeynep Tufekci (@zeynep) is an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, the author of “Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest” and a contributing opinion writer."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Facebook likely storing very personal data and you never knew it was happening | TheBlaze","text":["The archived data also included similar data for SMS text messages, although the actual messages themselves were not archived.","Part of the problem lies in a previous version of Android’s operating system, which gave Facebook access to certain metadata by default. However, if developers used the old API to access data, they could bypass the update.","Google, which owns Android, “depreciated” the old API last October. It appears that’s when user data stopped being archived.","It’s not clear how long the data was being collected and archived.","Why does this affect only Android users?","Because, as the Verge noted, Facebook recently made a push for Android users to use its messaging platform, Messenger, as their default SMS client. Apple iPhone users, on the other hand, use iMessage. More from Ars Technica:","Facebook uses phone-contact data as part of its friend recommendation algorithm. And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android and Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for access to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But even if users didn’t give that permission to Messenger, they may have given it inadvertently for years through Facebook’s mobile apps — because of the way Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past.","How did Facebook respond?","Facebook responded to the problem on Sunday in a “fact check” blog post. They denied that they had been collecting the phone and SMS metadata of Android users.","Instead, the social media giant claimed the feature is “opt-in.”","“Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook,” the company said.","“People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings … and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only,” Facebook explained.","But according to Ars Technica, user experiences directly contradict Facebook’s claims that revoking the permissions deletes the data. Instead, the tech news website says Facebook’s “opt-in” feature was turned on by default and wasn’t a separate option users had to trigger.","Ars Technica reported:","While data collection was technically “opt-in,” in both of these cases the opt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook’s application, not a separate notification of data collection. Facebook never explicitly revealed that the data was being collected, and it was only discovered as part of a review of the data associated with the accounts. The users we talked to only performed such reviews after the recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook data.","Still, Facebook emphasized it never sold users’ data.","“We never sell this data, and this feature does not collect the content of your text messages or calls,” the company wrote.","What can you do to stop Facebook from collecting your data?","According to Facebook, Android users need to turn off the feature in their settings.

Facebook was going to be how he won.\"","In an announcement posted on the president's campaign website, his son, Eric Trump, called Parscale \"an amazing talent\" who was \"pivotal to our success in 2016.\" Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and top adviser, said that Parscale \"was essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data-driven approach to how the 2016 campaign was run.\"","Last fall, Parscale spoke with 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl about his digital strategy in the 2016 election. While the president famously relies on Twitter to get his message out, Parscale spent the majority of the campaign's digital budget on Facebook, creating hundreds of thousands of ads microtargeted for specific voter communities.","\"I understood early that Facebook was how Donald Trump was going to win,\" Parscale told Stahl. \"Twitter is how he talked to the people.

OK, for the people who know me that's not really a secret, but I still need to put that out there because it's true. I would gladly pay for anything with dollars than data, and that includes Android or Chrome or any of Google's other services. Not because I think my data would be handled better if I were to exchange money, but because I'd rather not share it at all. Having said that, I know that I have to if I want to be able to use products or services that are worth a damn.","That's because of the same things that got Facebook into its latest privacy mess. The same data that can be used to allegedly influence voters by lying to them is also used to make life easier through personalization. The difference is not the data itself or how it's being collected; the difference is the company that is doing it and how honest it is. Unfortunately, that's hard to measure, and companies that do snatch up our information are all over the map when it comes to transparency and integrity.","I'd rather pay for Android updates with dollars than data, but inevitably the services wouldn't be nearly as good if I could.","By now I imagine everyone is tired of hearing about Facebook. Well, too bad because I know me and plenty of other people are never going to stop talking about its practices and why it doesn't deserve your trust. I also won't bother telling anyone to delete Facebook since the people that actually care about what Facebook did and what it will do again if given a chance already did the thing. No number of hashtags or witty sayings will make a difference, nor will being that guy who says \"I told you so!\" then remarks on how he deleted Facebook before it was cool. But I'll always have plenty to say when it comes to companies that use our data to make their millions, what we get in return, and what we need to know about all of it.","I want to start by clearing up some misconceptions about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Facebook did not sell your data to anyone, and seeing people who know better claiming it did is disheartening. What Facebook did was worse — it sold access to your data. And because of how Facebook tracks you across its platform and the web itself, it sold access to my data as well even though it doesn't have any of it. That's the most important distinction; Facebook tracks and keeps enough data that if you talk to me and someone else talks to me, it can build a profile on me based on the things we talked about. Then it lets someone else have access to that data without your or my approval.","Facebook isn't the only company that collects huge amounts of data about us each and every day. The elephant in the room here is Google, of course, but every other company that provides a service to you, whether that service is free or paid, also collects data. The amount and type of data can vary; I use Signal for messaging and know it collects some user data, but not nearly as much or as sensitive as the data Google collects. I also use products and services from Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Valve, Ubisoft, and the list goes on and each and every one of them collects user data from me. Some of them are more transparent about what they collect and how than others are, but so far none of them have sunk to the Facebook level of dishonesty about what they have on me and what they plan to do with it.","Did I trade my email address for a free copy of FarCry 5 when it launches in a few days? You bet I did, and now I need to hope Ubisoft is cool and doesn't abuse my trust.","I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that most everyone reading this is familiar with Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant. Each of these smart assistants has a level of personalization that changes what it is capable of, and if you've used them all it's easy to say something like Google Assistant knows more about you and can do more for you than Siri, for example. That's because Google collects and uses more pertinent data than Apple does. Both companies collect the same types of data, both inform you about what they collect and how they will use it, but Google has to retain and aggregate more of it to offer the personalization that makes you want to use its product because that's how Google makes money. It makes you want to use a thing, and by using it you provide an even better profile of yourself that it can anonymize and use to target advertisements. Apple makes money by selling you a physical product. Microsoft is somewhere in the middle.","What's important is to realize that these personalized services are built using the same methods that Cambridge Analytica allegedly used to profile people it thought were low-information voters and influence an election. Collect enough information about a person and it's almost like you know their likes and dislikes well enough to manipulate them. Maybe you want to convince them to vote a certain way, or maybe you want to show them products they will want to buy. At some basic level, there's little or no difference and data collection itself isn't the bad guy. It can be, but it can also be the good guy who reminds you that your anniversary is coming up or that you have a doctor appointment next Tuesday at 1:50.","If Google were to follow Facebook's playbook the results would be far worse than potentially influencing an election. Let's hope it never happens.","The \"bad guy\" can only be the company that uses this data in ways that aren't clear to its users. The really bad guy is the company that not only mistreats its customers but has means for third parties to jump in and molest our data for a fee. Facebook has thrown red flags when it comes to privacy for years by doing things like changing privacy settings when features are added, or playing loose with developer agreements and breaking rules about how they send app updates out. 'Dishonest' is really the only word I can find that describes my opinion of the company as a whole.","In contrast, Google is parked atop a mountain of the very same types of sensitive data from over one billion people. So is Apple. So is Microsoft. The difference is that they aren't doing things with it that expose it to others or something even worse. Each company has had its share of mishaps, and those mishaps correlate against the amount of data they collect; Apple has had privacy issues, Microsoft has had a few more, and Google has had even more. But so far they haven't been found to be doing anything malicious and privacy blunders are the result of bad decisions or bugs in the giant machines.","And that's the distinction that's not being made when we read someone saying we are a product and not a customer when we use free services in exchange for giving up our precious data. That's lazy and people need to stop saying it and start talking about it instead.","Jerry Hildenbrand","Jerry is Mobile Nation's resident nerd and proud of it.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said.","He said that “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign”.","$6.2 million from Trump campaign","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica.","“Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign.","He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organisation rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behaviour,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behaviour while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioural microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behaviour. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learnt that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people.

Here’s What to Know","The fallout from Facebook’s data scandal involving Cambridge Analytica continues this week, as more information came to light confirming that at least 87 million Facebook users were impacted by hidden data harvesting — an update from the “tens of millions” figure that Facebook previously said were touched by its ongoing privacy crisis.","Facebook, which is the largest social media company in the world, admitted today that the number was much higher than previously believed at the bottom of a blog post written by Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer.","“In total, we believe the Facebook information of up to 87 million people — mostly in the US — may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica,” he wrote.","Third party apps will now be restricted from accessing certain kinds of user information they could previously collect from Facebook features like Events, Groups and Pages. Other changes include updates to the ways third-party apps can collect data related to logins for things like “check-ins, likes, photos, posts, videos, events and groups,” the company’s statement reads.","It also says that apps will no longer be allowed to collect personal data such as “religious or political views, relationship status and details, custom friends lists, education and work history, fitness activity, book reading activity, music listening activity, news reading, video watch activity, and games activity.”","The social media juggernaut also announced that it has disabled certain features in “search and account recovery” to prevent people’s public profiles from being scraped by “malicious actors.” It is also completely shutting down its Partner Categories, which is “a product that lets third-party data providers offer their targeting directly on Facebook,” the statement says.","A new feature is also being added to everyone’s newsfeed — a link at the top of the page that will allow users to see what information apps they use have collected about them, and also allow users to remove those apps if they choose. Facebook pledged to alert those users whose personal data was improperly collected by Cambridge Analytica.","While the users affected are mainly in the U.S., the BBC has also reported that about one million of the 87 million users impacted are based in the U.K.","Facebook’s announcement that almost 90 million users were affected comes on the heels of the news that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress on April 11.","The drama began when the $500 billion company admitted earlier in March that data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica, which has close ties to President Trump’s election campaign and right-leaning megadonors, used data that had been collected from millions of users without their consent. Facebook has since suspended Cambridge Analytica’s access to its platform.","Facebook continues to take a beating from commentators and investors alike as its stock keeps plunging — the company’s market cap dropped $50 billion alone during first week that the scandal came to light, becoming its largest ever two-day drop. Meanwhile, lawmakers in the U.S. and the U.K. who demanded Zuckerberg explain his company’s practices may finally get some answers during his testimony next week.","Here’s what to know about Facebook’s latest crisis.","What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a political analysis firm that claims to build psychological profiles of voters to help its clients win elections. The company is accused of buying millions of Americans’ data from a researcher who told Facebook he was collecting it strictly for academic purposes. Facebook allowed Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge who owns a company called Global Science Research, to harvest data from users who downloaded his app. The problem was that Facebook users who agreed to give their information to Kogan’s app also gave up permission to harvest data on all their Facebook friends, as well, according to the Guardian.","The breach occurred when Kogan then sold this data to Cambridge Analytica, which is against Facebook’s rules. Facebook says it has since changed the way it allows researchers to collect data from the platform as a result.","Christopher Wylie, a whistleblower who worked at Cambridge Analytica before quitting in 2014, claimed on NBC’s Today Show Monday morning that the firm was “founded on misappropriated data of at least 50 million Facebook users.”","Wylie added that Cambridge Analytica’s goal was to establish profiling algorithms that would “allow us to explore mental vulnerabilities of people, and then map out ways to inject information into different streams or channels of content online so that people started to see things all over the place that may or may not have been true.”","The data firm initially told British Parliament it did not collect people’s information without their content during a hearing in February, but later admitted in a statement to the New York Times that they did in fact obtain the data, though the company claims to have deleted the information as soon as it found out it violated Facebook’s privacy rules.","Cambridge Analytica issued a number of press releases in the days following the explosive media reports, saying that it “strongly denies the claims” it acted improperly.","“In 2014 we received Facebook data and derivatives of Facebook data from another company, GSR, that we engaged in good faith to legally supply data for research,” the statement reads. “After it subsequently became known that GSR had broken its contract with Cambridge Analytica because it had not adhered to data protection regulation, Cambridge Analytica deleted all the Facebook data and derivatives, in cooperation with Facebook… This Facebook data was not used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump presidential campaign.”","Facebook also issued a statement on its website Monday saying that the claim there was a data breach is “completely false” and Facebook users “gave their consent” when they signed up for certain kinds of apps, like the one Kogan exploited for data collection purposes. The social media juggernaut also maintained that “no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Who is the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower?","Christopher Wylie, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica, spoke out about the firm’s practices on the Today Show Monday morning after previously giving an interview to the New York Times. Wylie, who quit the company in 2014, said he believes it’s important for Americans to know what companies are doing with their personal information, as well as whether Cambridge Analytica’s practices influenced the democratic process.","“This was a company [Cambridge Analytica] that really took fake news to the next level by powering it with algorithms,” he said in an interview on the Today Show Monday morning.","Wylie also claimed that Cambridge Analytica has been in talks with Russian oil companies and employs a psychologist who works on Russia-funded projects. Any ties between Cambridge and Russia could complicate matters for Facebook, which has spent the past several months grappling with accusations that Moscow used it and other social media networks to meddle in the 2016 U.S. elections.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said Wylie left the company to found a rival firm.","“Their source is a former contractor for Cambridge Analytica – not a founder as has been claimed – who left in 2014 and is misrepresenting himself and the company throughout his comments,” the company said.","What is Cambridge Analytica’s connection to Steve Bannon?","Onetime Trump campaign advisor and Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was previously vice president of Cambridge Analytica’s board, according to the New York Times. Wylie told the Guardian that Bannon was his boss at Cambridge Analytica. Bannon has been involved in propping up right-wing political groups for years, having been the executive chairman and co-founder of Breitbart News, a far right-wing digital publication, until he stepped down from the position in January.","Additionally, Republican megadonor and onetime Breitbart News CEO Robert Mercer, who has funded numerous conservative campaigns at every level of government, invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica. His daughter, Rebekah Mercer was also a board member of the political data firm. The Mercers originally supported Ted Cruz’ presidential campaign, but became patrons of the Trump campaign after Cruz bowed out of the 2016 presidential race.","He gave a timeline explaining how the improper data harvesting occurred, and said that in 2014 the company changed its practices to limit the ability of “abusive apps” to collect data from users and their other Facebook friends who did not give consent.","“In 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social…To do this, we enabled people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them….In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends’ data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends’ data.”","Zuckerberg also acknowledged that journalists informed Facebook as early as 2015 that Kogan shared this data with Cambridge Analytica, and said the company subsequently banned Kogan’s apps from the social network because they violated Facebook policies.","“This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that,” he wrote on Facebook.","He also said the company will investigate all apps that had “access to large amount of information” before the 2014 policy changes, and that Facebook plans to further restrict developers’ access to Facebook users’ data moving forward. The company will also make it easier for users to deny permission to third party developers that collect their personal information. As part of this effort, the company plans to move its privacy tool to the top of the News Feed.","Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg shared Zuckerberg’s post on her own Facebook page, saying she “deeply regrets” that the company did not do more to address the problem. Facebook will also start to ban developers who misuse “personally identifiable information” and alert users when Facebook learns their data has been misused, she wrote.","SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT","You May Like","Read More","Sign Up for Our Newsletters","Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know now on politics, health, money and more"],"isopubdate":""}

The threats to personal privacy and democratic governance exposed in this case are not an isolated phenomenon, but rather the tip of an iceberg. Alarming as they are, the revelations of Christopher Wylie, the 28-year-old Canadian who helped found Cambridge Analytica, pale in comparison with those of another young, brave, conscientious whistleblower.","In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed the mass secret surveillance of domestic populations by the National Security Agency (NSA) and its Five Eyes partners, including Canada. These exposés open our eyes to the perils of globe-spanning organizations with insatiable appetites for personal information operating largely unfettered by weak privacy-protection regimes. They lend urgency to the calls of Canada's Privacy Commissioner for additional powers to make data custodians more transparent and accountable in their activities.","Story continues below advertisement","Even long overdue strengthening of domestic privacy protections will be partial at best, however, given that an estimated 90 per cent of Canadians' internet communications pass through the United States. Once across the border, personal information loses Canadian legal and constitutional protections and becomes subject to surveillance by the NSA and other organizations without the safeguards afforded to U.S. citizens.","Exposure to U.S. risks comes in several ways. The internet services most popular among Canadians – including Facebook, Google and Twitter – all store users' data in the United States. But even a significant portion of Canadian domestic internet communication, including Canadians exchanging e-mail with each other or accessing a website located in Canada, will have their personal data routed through the United States. Surprisingly, this \"boomerang routing\" is common when both parties are in the same city, even across the street from each other. And nearly all international communications pass through the United States because Canada lacks adequate access to trans-oceanic fibre-optic cables.","The current heavy reliance of Canadian internet operations on U.S. facilities puts personal and corporate data at risk while impairing the efficiency and quality of Canadian internet services. This one-sided dependence on the United States for a major part of critical national infrastructure also weakens bilateral bargaining power. These challenges point to the central, overarching issue, which is weak Canadian sovereignty in the internet realm.","Any strategy aiming to protect Canadians' privacy must actively pursue national sovereignty in the domain of network infrastructures. To advance the public interest, a country needs to exercise effective control over the communication networks upon which the social and economic life of the country depend. While a new term, the concept of network sovereignty is old. Indeed, public investment in and oversight of national transportation and communication infrastructure has been central to the Canadian nation-building project from the early 19th century. The twin imperatives have been to foster development and to knit disparate communities into a more cohesive whole, especially in the face of forces pulling Canada into the U.S. orbit. Canada's Telecommunications Act reflects this historic tradition, mandating internet sovereignty in its declaration that \"telecommunications performs an essential role in the maintenance of Canada's identity and sovereignty.\" It further seeks \"to contribute to the protection of the privacy of persons.\"","\"Localization\" is the most obvious approach to achieving network sovereignty in the case of the internet. This means keeping data within the region of their creation and use whenever feasible; that is, storing and routing the personal data of Canadians within Canadian jurisdiction. As a promising first step in this direction, Microsoft has recently established data centres in Toronto and Montreal for storing Canadians' personal information as much as possible under Canadian legal protection. Other major service providers, notably Facebook and Google, should be required to do likewise.","Keeping Canadian domestic internet data flows within Canadian jurisdiction involves developing greater technical capacity to route traffic efficiently through domestic facilities. Public internet exchange points (IXPs) represent the most promising first step toward data-routing localization. IXPs enable local networks to reach users on other networks without having to leave the region for local delivery. This improves performance, reduces transit cost and delay, and can often avoid boomerang routing through the United States and the risks this poses. A further step is to expand access to Canada's long-haul internet backbone, especially for linking IXPs.","Finally, whatever success is achieved in strengthening Canadian privacy protections and advancing network sovereignty, there will remain a vital public interest in ensuring safe, free, open global internet communication. Doing so will require developing a robust international internet governance regime that meets human rights standards and strengthens democracy. Helping to forge such an international regime will be integral to achieving national sovereignty and public-interest goals in relation to the internet.","Story continues below advertisement","Story continues below advertisement","This article draws on Canadian Network Sovereignty: A Strategy for Twenty-first-Century National Infrastructure Building, a forthcoming essay in the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI)'s series onData Governance in the Digital Age.","Tickers mentioned in this story","Data UpdateUnchecking box will stop auto data updates","Comments are closed","We have closed comments on this story for legal reasons or for abuse.

This was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time. We’re now taking steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again.” Zuckerberg went on to assure Facebook users that the social-media company would be “limiting the data apps get when you sign in,” and was also “investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this.”","As several on social media have pointed out, Facebook’s choice to list the steps it will take to self-regulate reads as an attempt to pre-empt any kind of official regulation—a threat that has become increasingly likely as Zuckerberg has stumbled into one minefield after another.","It’s unclear, however, whether this strategy will work. Congressional committees in both the House and the Senate have called on Zuckerberg to personally testify before them. “Mr. Zuckerberg needs to come and testify,” Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday. “He created this entity, he in effect created this industry, and he needs to come explain [himself] to the American public.” (Zuckerberg has said he’d be “open” to testifying before Congress if he’s the “right person” to do so.)","Even Apple’s Tim Cooksaid on Saturday that he believes “well-crafted” privacy regulations should be imposed on social-media companies’ data usage, to prevent a repeat of the Cambridge Analytica leak: “The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life—from my own point of view, it shouldn’t exist.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

(credit: Jason Alden/Bloomberg via Getty Images)","In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations regarding the exposure of profile data for millions of users, Facebook is now facing an investigation into its data-collection practices by the Federal Trade Commission. In a statement issued on March 26, FTC Consumer Protection Bureau Acting Director Tom Pahl said that the FTC “takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","The FTC investigation will likely focus on what data Facebook shares with third parties. But third parties aren’t the only entity hoping to win “friends” and influence people on this social platform. Facebook collects a great deal of information about users for use by its internal algorithms. Those algorithms govern who and what users see, whom they get recommended to “friend,” and other aspects of how our Facebook experiences are subtly (or sometimes not-so-subtly) shaped by advertisers and others leveraging the platform.","As Ars reported, Facebook has pushed users to allow access to SMS messages and call logs with its Messenger and Facebook Lite applications under the auspices of providing a service. “Keep up with all your conversations in one place” by using the app as the default SMS application on Android phones, Facebook offers. Previous versions of the Facebook mobile app on Android (in versions of Android prior to 4.1) were able to read SMS and call logs simply by asking for access to contacts, which Facebook has described as standard practice for applications. This allowed Facebook to keep track of the time, length, and contact information for any call made or received by the Android device by uploading it to Facebook’s data centers. Facebook could also access metadata about text and multimedia messages sent via SMS."],"isopubdate":""}

He's also the man who helped found Cambridge Analytica.","\"It was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country, without their consent or awareness.\"","The reports provided many details about the whistleblower who in 2007 or 2008 landed his first political gig with the federal Liberals.","At age 17, he worked in the office of Canada's opposition leader, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stéphane Dion, said one of the reports. When he was 18 years old, the newspaper said he learned all about data while working for officials on former U.S. president Barack Obama's campaign team, and later introduced one director to the Liberals.","A senior source with the Liberal Party said Sunday that Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss staffing details.","However, former Liberal officials from that time said they either hadn't heard of Wylie — or they barely remembered him.","\"I vaguely recall him,\" wrote one former senior official in an email Sunday. \"I think that he was a summer intern.\"","Another former senior Liberal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he asked former colleagues Sunday and some people remembered Wylie. They say he was \"pretty junior\" and worked in the data strategy and communications space.","One former party official, however, said while they didn't know Wylie well, they remembered him as a \"big advocate of microtargeting.\"","Liberal Party insists it doesn't sell information","One of the newspaper reports said Wylie came up with the idea behind Cambridge Analytica at age 24.","The article also said Wylie was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia as a teen and left school at 16 years old without any qualifications. After working for the Liberals and Obama's campaign, the report said he taught himself to code at age 19 and later studied law at the London School of Economics.","The reports also said Cambridge Analytica played a major role in the referendum that led to Britain's vote to leave the European Union.","Another article published May 2017 by The Guardian quoted a source that connected Wylie to a web analytics company in Victoria, B.C., called AggregateIQ. The firm has come under scrutiny in Britain for its possible role in helping the Leave campaign win the Brexit referendum.","Asked about Wylie, Canada's Liberal Party said in a statement Sunday that protecting the information of Canadians it engages with is a \"foremost priority.\"","Christopher Wylie told CBC News that Cambridge Analytica targeted millions of Americans during the election campaign without their knowledge based on psychological profiles and surveys. (Lily Martin/CBC)","The party said it has a clear, stringent policy that protects individuals' private information. It also said its agreements with campaign partners also include strict requirements.","The party insists it doesn't sell information under any circumstances.","A spokeswoman for Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould said Sunday that social media platforms have a responsibility to help ensure citizens and the democratic processes are protected from \"threats like foreign interference, data breaches, hate speech, and misinformation.\"","\"While some social media platforms have begun to take initial steps to address these issues, it's clear that much more needs to be done,\" Jordan Owens wrote in an email.","Owens said the government would work with social media firms to ensure they respect and help preserve the integrity of Canada's democracy.","Facebook said in a weekend blog post that claims the harvesting of user information was a data breach are \"completely false.\"","The statement said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his Facebook app.","\"People knowingly gave their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" said the post by Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice-president and deputy general counsel.","External Links","Popular Now","Comments","To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information. According to Facebook, that download might also include the “unique number” Facebook assigns to you for facial recognition purposes, based on the photos you’ve been tagged in on the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

Its technology was also credited with swinging the Brexit referendum. But then Cambridge Analytica downplayed its role, and the Leave EU gang, who had been so keen to talk up its presence, also decided they weren’t involved, really. But now Cambridge Analytica is back in the news, and for all the wrong reasons.","The company has had its Facebook presence suspended, which may raise a few eyebrows. Why should a social media provider pull the presence of a company that does nothing more than analyse data? Ah well. After telling “We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies. They cannot buy ads or administer its clients' pages”, the man from Facebook spelled it out.","“They certified deleting user data they received from an app developer in 2015 but we have since learned that not all of it may have been removed. This is a clear violation of our policies and terms of service … we are still looking into these issues so will share more as we get deeper”. It’s a data breach. And it’s a serious one.","Facebook’s official statement explains “In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica … Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. Approximately 270k people downloaded the app”.","And what was that information? “In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it”.","So what action was taken when this was discovered? “By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica … he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan … certified to us that they destroyed the data”.","There may be trouble ahead ...","Except CA did not delete all that data. And for anyone still shrugging shoulders and responding “so what?”, both the Brexit referendum and the US Presidential Election came the year after Facebook discovered the violation, and CA said they’d deleted the info.","... and someone will be facing the music very soon","So the not-actually-deleted data was still there during those campaigns. That, folks, is why this discovery matters, why it is a big story, and why you should be concerned. And just how big a story we will find out very soon. How that might occur cannot be told at present, but Carole Cadwalladr of the Observer has mused “Waking up to the news that Facebook has suspended Cambridge Analytica today? TWO YEARS after it discovered massive data breach? Wondering why now? Answers coming soon”.","Ms Cadwalladr’s paper comes out tomorrow. I’ll just leave that one there.","[UPDATE 1400 hours: tomorrow's Observer feature has been made available online already, and in it Carole Cadwalladr reveals that the personal information of more than 50 million individuals was harvested and used improperly in what must be one of the biggest and most embarrassing - for Facebook, at least - data breaches ever.","Most of those whose data was harvested were registered US voters. Confirmation has come from a whistleblower, who has passed what he knows to the National Crime Agency's cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner's office.","What information might have been harvested on voters in the UK is not known. But what can be told is that the Observer article is only the first instalment: there will be more from other media outlets very soon.","Those who sneeringly labelled Ms Cadwalladr, and others involved in bringing this story into the open, as mere tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists were plain flat wrong.

Comments on every topic. A tone of spittle-flecked ranting. Well-informed but paranoid approach to all topics.

In between posts from friends and family, you may notice lots of links offering various quizzes. Innocuous things like this:","SCREENSHOT","Harmless, right? It’s reasonable to assume that worst thing about the glut of these quizzes is that you’ll waste your time on something relatively pointless.","But in reality, these silly little quizzes are much more nefarious. Once you log in to Facebook in order to access a quiz, a little warning pops up:","SCREENSHOT","Most Facebook users have seen this warning and thought nothing of it, clicking through to view the quiz. In 2014, a political data company used a simple personality quiz (with a very similar warning) to gather information on millions of Americans.","This company, Cambridge Analytica, claimed they were only collecting data on the user clicking on the quiz, when in reality they were also accessing the profiles of every “friend” the user had.","From the @Guardian on Trump-linked Cambridge Analytica’s data mining tricks: “…hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.” Don’t do this shit, folks.","Not only did the firm misrepresent whose data they were collecting, they also misrepresented the data as “collected for academic use,” when in fact the data was used for political purposes.","Here’s why Cambridge Analytica was kicked off – they reportedly built an app, paid people to take a personality test and then hoovered up data from 50 million of the tester’s friends, matching it to electoral rolls. Extraordinary. pic.twitter.com/W8IC0qN791","Cambridge Analytica’s data capture was extremely vital in creating the targeted advertising used to elect Donald Trump in 2016. In an interview with the Today Show, Christopher Wylie (co-founder of Cambridge Analytica) laid out the connection between this Facebook data breach and the models built by Cambridge Analytica for use by the Trump campaign. The interviewer asked:","‘You’ve said that Facebook improperly obtained data for up to 50 million Facebook users. And the point of this was to develop personality profiles and then target political advertising to them… Did the Trump campaign in 2016 use that improperly accessed data?’","Wylie left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, before their partnership with the Trump campaign, but had knowledge of the possible collaboration before departing:","‘The company had been in talks with Trump even before he announced his candidacy. What I do know is that this was the foundation of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was founded on misappropriated data of at least 50 million Facebook users.’","He then offers specifics on the timeline of collaboration between the company and Trump:","‘What I do know is that CA was meeting with Corey Lewandowski in 2015 before Trump had even announced, offering the services that I’m talking about right now.","The interviewer, Savannah Guthrie, pressed Wylie on the way the Facebook data was used. He responded:","‘This data was used to create profiling algorithms that would allow us to explore mental vulnerabilities of people and then map out ways to inject information into different streams or channels of content online so that people would see things all over the place that may or may not be true.’","So what’s the difference between this company’s services and the usual modes of political advertising?","‘The fundamental difference between what Cambridge Analytica has done and standard political messaging is that when I show you an ad for a candidate it says “Hi, I’m So-and so, and I approve this message.” It is apparent that they are seeing political advertising. It’s apparent that they are trying to be convinced.","‘But what Cambridge Analytica does is works on creating a web of disinformation online so that people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on of blogs, websites, etcetera, to make them think that certain things are happening that may not be.’","Several times in the interview, Wylie asserts that the psycologists working with Cambridge Analytica were traveling back and forth between their home base of London and Moscow.","Cambridge Analytica was not solely a contractor hired by the Trump campaign to do marketing. For one, both Trump campaign staffers Steve Bannon and Corey Lewandowski were connected to the company:","This is a good time to remind everyone that Steve Bannon was Vice President and Secretary of Cambridge Analytica since June 2014 and \"left\" just before the election. Corey Lewandowski started meeting with them in 2015. Now, let's ask, how did Cory become campaign manager? pic.twitter.com/BBVyBwsmgC","Damningly, former National Security Advisor, transition team member, and campaign advisor Mike Flynn came forward in August of 2017 to admit to contracting with Cambridge Analytica’s parent company.","Incredible just how much #Flynn misrepresented the facts. And NOW we learn he took money from Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL? The same company that pilfered Facebook data to micro-target US voters. And which has connections to Russia. https://t.co/tIYCe9yFsc"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Pressed by the committee chairman at the Commons liaison committee later in the day, the prime minister said “Mr Zuckerberg will decide for himself” whether to give evidence to parliament.","She said the Cambridge Analytica affair “raises very deep concern in terms of what is suggested” and repeatedly said it was for Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and any individuals involved to “cooperate fully” with the information commissioner.","The company’s head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, said in a letter to Collins: “Facebook fully recognises the level of public and parliamentary interest in these issues and support your belief that these issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position to answer your questions. As such, Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available.”","Both men, Stimson wrote, “report directly to Mr Zuckerberg and are among the longest-serving senior representatives in Facebook’s 15-year history. Both of them have extensive expertise in these issues and are well placed to answer the committee’s questions on these complex subjects.”","During Tuesday’s committee hearing, Wylie suggested Facebook may have been aware of the large-scale harvesting of data carried out by Cambridge Analytica’s partner GSR even earlier than had been previously reported.","“I remember, and I think this was in around July 2014, [Aleksandr Kogan, GSR’s founder] was delayed for a couple of days because Facebook had throttled the app so that it couldn’t pull as much data, or there was some problem with pulling the data at the same speed as before.","“He told me he had had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook. So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers, or at least that’s what he told me.”","It took until 2015 for Facebook to take action on the data-harvesting project, after a Guardian article detailing GSR’s data abuse in support of the Ted Cruz campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.","And it was not until last week, after Facebook had again been notified by the Observer about the harvesting, that the company released a statement noting that “the entire company is outraged that we were deceived”.","Wylie also claimed that Palantir, a national security contractor owned by the Facebook board member Peter Thiel, was allowed informal access to the Facebook data harvested by GSR.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir,” Wylie said. “There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data. That was not an official contract between Palantir and CA, but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data. And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.”","Despite the confidentiality agreements he entered into with Cambridge Analytica, Wylie described Facebook’s attempts to kill last week’s story as being the most forceful.","“The most amount of legal pushback that I’ve got actually wasn’t from Cambridge Analytica, it was from Facebook. It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he said.","“They sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t taken action on that. I think, I’m not sure exactly what they’re planning to do. They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me any more.”","Testifying alongside Wylie was Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of personaldata.io, who has been fighting to force the social network to apply European data protection law. Dehaye revealed that Facebook repeatedly tried to argue it was exempt from fulfilling “subject access” requirements, which allow individuals to see the data that companies hold about them, because it would be too expensive to comply.","“They’re invoking exceptions … involving disproportionate effort,” Dehaye said. “They’re saying it’s too much effort to give me access to my data. I find that quite intriguing, because they’re making a technical and a business argument as to why I shouldn’t have access to this data.","“In the technical argument they’re shooting themselves in the foot, because they’re saying they’re so big the cost would be too large to provide me data.”","In effect, Dehaye said, Facebook told him it was too big to regulate. “They’re really arguing that they’re too big to comply with data protection law, the cost is too high, which is mind-boggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make this argument?”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The social media giant, which is already grappling with mounting criticism over the dissemination of fake news and Russian propaganda to influence the 2016 presidential election on its platform, will certainly face more scrutiny.","The backdrop: The reports on Saturday comes after Facebook announced Friday that it has suspended Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) and its affiliate Cambridge Analytica for \"violating our platform policies.\"","The details: The data firm reportedly paid a University of Cambridge professor to acquire the personal information via a Facebook app. The social giant told the Times that the professor, Aleksandr Kogan, claimed to be collecting it for academic reasons. The Times said Facebook downplayed the leak when it sought comment for the story this week.","Cambridge Analytica's chief executive Alexander Nix, and other officials, had denied obtaining or using Facebook data. The company acknowledged in a statement that it obtained Facebook data though it blamed the professor for violating the platform's rules.","The Times reported that Facebook has not fully re-taken control of the data, and reported that an ex-employee claimed to have seen hundreds of unencrypted gigabytes on Cambridge servers. Cambridge Analytica said in its statement that it \"deleted all data received from\" from the company run by the academic.","\"No data from [the company run by Kogan] was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" the company said.","What they're saying: Facebook executives deny the incident represents a data breach. “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook,\" Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement. \"If these reports are true, it's a serious abuse of our rules. All parties involved — including the SCL Group/Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie and Aleksandr Kogan -- certified to us that they destroyed the data in question. \"","Amid reports that the data is not destroyed, Grewal said Facebook is suspending the three parties from Facebook, pending further information.

So, too, do many cycling New Yorkers. But Mr. Bell hates it so much that he has tried to do something about it: Three years ago he sued U.P.S., targeting the delivery company’s trucks for blocking his bike path, a case he lost that is in its second round of appeals.","Now Mr. Bell is trying another tack — the 30-year-old computer scientist who lives in Harlem has created a prototype of a machine-learning algorithm that studies footage from a traffic camera and tracks precisely how often bike lanes are obstructed by delivery trucks, parked cars and waiting cabs, among other scofflaws. It is a piece of data that transportation advocates said is missing in the largely anecdotal discussion of how well the city’s bus and bike lanes do or do not work.","At a time of intense criticism of New York’s poorly performing public transportation, Mr. Bell has expanded his study to also look at the flow of bus lanes in a city where the fleet operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority inches along at an average speed of seven miles per hour, making it the slowest major bus system in the country.","The blocking of bus and bike lanes has become a sore spot among transportation advocates who believe the city’s enforcement efforts are inadequate.","Mr. Bell’s project focused on one city block — St. Nicholas Avenue between 145th and 146th Streets — over the course of 10 days. His preliminary findings were stark: Using traffic-camera footage trained on one bus stop and two bike lanes (one for traveling north, the other for heading south), Mr. Bell found that the bus stop was blocked 57 percent of the time, while the bike lanes were blocked 40 percent of the time.","“Everyone keeps talking about the bus lanes being blocked, and buses being so slow I could just say, ‘Oh they are so blocked, it’s so bad,’ — but that’s not very helpful,” Mr. Bell said in an interview. “I thought to myself, ‘How could you show to everyone that bus stops and bike lanes are routinely blocked?’ ”","As the city has rolled out a total of 101 miles of specially designated bus lanes throughout the city, keeping them clear has emerged as a major challenge — what good is a bus-only pathway if it is blocked by an idling car, mail truck or even a police officer? The same goes for the 435 miles of unprotected bike lanes that are painted green and lace New York’s streetscape.","But no data exists that captures the scope of the problem in a quantifiable way. In its absence, biking and transit advocates have taken matters into their own hands, posting photos of offenders, including government and police vehicles, on social media as a way of countering the problem through public shaming.","The enforcement that does exist through the use of cameras is slim: Just 12 of the city’s 317 bus routes have cameras mounted on objects like streetlights that are similar to red-light cameras. Any plan to add more such cameras must be approved by the State Legislature.","Enforcement along bus lanes and bike paths is primarily the responsibility of the Police Department. Last year, police officers issued over 2,000 moving violations to vehicles traveling in bus lanes, about 24,000 parking tickets for blocking lanes and about 79,000 parking tickets for impeding bike lanes. Data does not exist for moving violations in bike lanes, which the police began tracking this year.","While those numbers seem impressive, advocates believe it barely touches the severity of the problem. “Based on anyone’s observation, bus lanes in New York are chronically blocked,’’ said Paul Steely White, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a bicycling advocacy organization.","Image","Mr. Bell said he was motivated to figure out a way to illustrate a problem that he routinely encounters. “I thought to myself,’' he said, ‘How could you show to everyone that bus stops and bike lanes are routinely blocked?’”CreditChristopher Lee for The New York Times","Andy Byford, the president of New York City Transit, has met with the Police Department to encourage the agency to increase its vigilance. Blocking the bus lane, “is selfish, and it’s unacceptable,” Mr. Byford said in a recent interview aboard a bus that was forced to swerve in and out of a designated bus lane to avoid parked vans and idling taxis.","“I get that people have to deliver things, but the bus lane should be for the buses, period,” Mr. Byford said, adding that the transit agency is developing a plan to improve bus service that may include adding front-facing cameras mounted on buses, a measure that other cities have taken to strengthen enforcement of bus-only lanes.","Increasing the number of bus and bike lanes, but under-enforcing the rules to keep them unimpeded, “is one of these programs that ratchets up New Yorker sincere cynicism about government doing the right thing,” Mr. White said.","To gather actual data on how often blockages occur, Mr. Bell downloaded 10 days of publicly available video from a Department of Transportation camera mounted on a traffic light at the corner of 145th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue. Then he fed over 2,000 images of different types of vehicles, like trucks, buses and cars into his computer, training it to identify what exactly was blocking the way. In the case of bus stops, for example, Mr. Bell adjusted the computer program so that it was able to differentiate between buses that are supposed to be there from vehicles that were sitting there illegally.","His work took about three weeks. After the programming was complete, it took the computer about a day to crunch though the 10 days of footage. Mr. Bell’s program only measured the percentage of time the lanes on his test block were obstructed, but from that he said he was able to extrapolate actual numbers and calculated about 850 vehicles blocking the bike lane and over 1,000 in the bus lane. He has made the source code he developed to monitor the lanes free and publicly available online in the hope that it will be picked up and used to amplify the extent of the issue.","“I want to raise up New York City,” said Mr. Bell, who grew up on the Upper West Side, and attended Horace Mann School and Columbia University. “I never want to live anywhere else, but we have big problems. We have big problems especially when it comes to transportation. I am hoping that just seeing the data will help it be less ignorable.”"],"isopubdate":"2282-10-07"}

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","\"I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,\" said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the \"maximum exposure\" could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more - likely in the tens of millions - because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user's list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend's demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","\"They say 'trust us,' but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement.","Rep. Adam Schiff, Calif., the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","\"I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,\" Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. \"There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms.\"","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union's justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","\"I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,\" Collins said Sunday. \"It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.\"","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","\"We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,\" Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, said in the statement. \"That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information.\"","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a \"breach\" of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook's request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor's role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook's privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica's app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ecree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, \"We've heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.\" That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend's data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday, \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, \"bespeaks the same recklessness with its users' data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.\"","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","\"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,\" Rich said. \"They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.\"","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users' sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users' friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users' explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers' consent before \"enacting changes that override their privacy practices,\" the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","\"This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission's failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,\" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can't do the job.\"","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla., also criticized Facebook on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"","\"Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they're above the rules that apply to everybody else,\" Rubio said."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

By clicking the consent button, you agree to allow the site to use, collect and/or store cookies.","[Facebook] Using the Facebook Pixel to Unlock the Full Potential of Facebook Ads","As we dive deeper into the many Facebook tools that exist to help you get the most out of your advertising campaigns, we have to take some time to talk about the Facebook Pixel. Facebook Pixel is an analytics tool that you install within your website code in order to track visitors that have been targeted by your Facebook Ads.","The Pixel provides a mine of information by tracking conversions, as well as helping you to optimize Ads effectively and create custom target audiences. This ultimately enables you to use Facebook Ads in the most effective way possible. The main benefits of installing Facebook Pixel are that it provides a direct insight into exactly how your Ad is working for you, who it is targeting, and finally what type of activities your Ad triggers on your website.","Installing the Pixel is quite simple: you create it on the Facebook Business platform using the step-by-step guide, and then add the code to your website as instructed. Whether you update your own website, have a webmaster, or use a popular website platform, Facebook will walk you through how and where to add the Pixel code. Once it has been installed you can also add a Plugin to your browser to troubleshoot and test the Pixel. You can access your Pixel’s analytics through your Ad Manager page on Facebook.","You can refine your Pixel to track all types of data including demographics and customer trends. The idea is that with every Ad campaign you launch, you will be able to invest in a mine of data that will significantly aid you in driving conversions.","More concretely, your Facebook Pixel will help you optimize your Ads by improving the following:","How you track conversions: your Pixel will allow you to see what people do once they arrive on your website after clicking on an Ad. You can monitor all types of trends and preferences, even down to the type of device a customer uses. For example, if most of your customers are on a mobile device, you may want to create mobile-only Ads.","How to retarget content: you can use your Pixel data as a way to retarget your Ads towards those who have already visited your site before. This can help finalize previously abandoned conversions, and reignite interest in your business.","How to create custom audiences: your Pixel will help you create the correct custom audiences for your brand by tracking who your Ad attracts as well as how they engage with your website. The more targeted your approach the better your return on investment will be.","When you create your Facebook Pixel, you can specify the tracking abilities by using some or all of the nine standard events provided by Facebook. Each event represents one of the different actions that a user may take while browsing your website: if they add content to their cart, whether they purchase or not, if they sign up for something, and so on. It is also possible to create custom conversions based on certain specific actions, products, or URLs that you are looking to target.","You can create custom audiences by collecting existing customer data and setting your Ads to target these customers. This way you not only have a high possibility of attracting more conversions, you will also be able to widen your sphere of influence by targeting similar audiences. Facebook allows you to create lookalike custom audiences based on existing customer demographics. A great hack for creating the best lookalike audience is to use your existing email list and load the emails into your customer file in your Ad Manager page and have Facebook generate a lookalike audience. You can then fifine-tunehis audience by adding specific values that will attract as many people as possible (these values should be relevant to the content that you publish and sell).","If you installed the Pixel in 2015 or before, Facebook now has a much more effective Pixel that combines both conversion tracking and custom audience creation. You can start the conversion by creating a new Pixel code and adding it to your website. Once the new code is installed you will need to migrate your Ads over to the Facebook Pixel through your Ad Manager page. Facebook recommends migrating slowly using the Pixel to start collecting data over time, as migrating everything over at once could be cost prohibitive. Once the migration is complete you can remove the old tracking pixel code. Remember to troubleshoot the Pixel using your browser plugin before you delete the old code!","In order for your campaign to be really effective from the get-go, we recommend installing your Facebook Pixel before you have even launched your first Ad. The really great thing about the Facebook Pixel is that is an all-in-one tracking, optimization, and targeting tool, allowing you to really make the most out of your Facebook advertising campaigns.","You May Also Like:","Retirement Planning for Authors If you take a look around the traditional workplace these days, you see more and more people working up until the point where they just can’t physically complete their job anymore — whether it be due to physical illness, simple old age, or obsolescence.

Both devices are said to use a new voice assistant. A January report from Cheddar said that the video chat device would be named \"Portal\" and that it could be priced at $499. Work on the devices is said to be led by Facebook's Building 8 team, a group within the social media giant that focuses on consumer hardware.","Further Reading","Bloomberg says Facebook planned to unveil its new smart home products at its annual F8 developer conference in May, with a full product release coming in the fall. But the Cambridge Analytica controversy and the subsequent public outrage over Facebook's handling of user data appear to have put the big reveal on the back burner. (Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that did work for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was revealed to have retained copies of private data for some 50 million Facebook users.) The report says Facebook is now taking a closer look at the products to ensure they make the \"right trade-offs regarding user data.\"","Various reports this week said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to testify before Congress in the coming weeks over the company's privacy practices.","Despite the concerns over Facebook's customer data usage practices, many of which existed well before the Cambridge Analytica uproar, the report says Facebook still plans to release the speakers sometime this year.

Facebook Still Has It.","Thumbnails from videos a user never posted and believed she had deleted, but that Facebook saved anyway.","Have you downloaded your Facebook data archive yet? Facebook makes it easy to obtain a ZIP file of all the data it has on you: your status updates, your friend list, your messages … and, as I and several people I spoke with were surprised to discover, every video you ever filmed on the platform — including videos you never published.","Cambridge Analytica’s effect on the election is still disputed, but if there’s one thing everyone can agree is true in the wake of the scandal over its data-harvesting, it’s that we’ve paid far too little attention to the scale and scope of the data that Facebook has collected on us over our years of platform use. It’s true that, in most cases, we’ve “consented” to this kind of data-gathering by clicking “okay” on a dense terms-of-service contract, and neglecting to opt out. But given how often the details are ignored, it’s disconcerting to discover exactly what data has been gathered.","Last week, Facebook users around the world discovered that Facebook’s Android app had, in some cases, Hoovered up extensive call data without their awareness. “When this feature is enabled, uploading your contacts also allows us to use information like when a call or text was made or received. This feature does not collect the content of your calls or text messages,” Facebook said, noting that users had to initially opt in to have their communication tracked. But it seems unlikely that many of the people who “opted in” were aware that they’d done so, or what exactly it meant.","And call logs aren’t the only data Facebook’s been holding to user surprise. Earlier this week, like many people around the world, my sister Bailey downloaded her Facebook data archives. Along with the contact lists and relationship statuses was something unexpected: several different videos of her attempting to play a scale on a wooden flute in her childhood bedroom.","Each video, she discovered, was a different “take” — recorded on Facebook, but then, she assumed, discarded before she posted the final version to a friend’s wall. (In the archive, you can infer which video was posted on a wall versus the ones that weren’t based on the comments. Videos that were never published are commentless.) In one of the clips, you can hear Kircher say, exasperatedly, that it is her 13th take. At the end of the clip, which isn’t to her liking, she groans and reaches forward, apparently to delete the video and try again.","Bailey Kircher never posted this video on Facebook, but still found a copy of it in her Facebook archive.","How did this happen? In the pre–Facebook Live era, leaving videos on your friends’ walls was something of a crude FaceTime. You’d post a video, they’d respond with a video, and so forth. Importantly, Facebook had a feature that let users film videos via webcam on Facebook itself — that is, without ever leaving the Facebook site to use a video recorder. Once you were done filming, Facebook would show you a preview of your clip. If you decided to do another take, you could click to discard that video and try it again. Except, the video wasn’t actually deleted. Instead, Facebook apparently saved your unused clip.","Another co-worker, Brittany Stephanis, found over 100 videos in her archive and says that she only ever publicly posted about a third of them. The earliest date back to Christmas Day in 2008 when Stephanis, then 13, started recording videos to wish her friends a happy holiday. Stephanis says that her archive contains videos she clearly never planned to shared with anyone. “There are videos of me just checking my teeth,” she explained. My sister also had videos — rehearsing for school musicals and cheerleading — where she was using Facebook’s desktop camera to review herself and then erase, or so she thought, the video forever.","I thought this was a funny quirk of my sister’s. And then I looked at my own data archive. There, at the bottom of the list of videos I’d put on the platform, I found clips that appear to have never been posted to Facebook but were saved anyway.","From what I can tell, most people haven’t noticed this yet. (Or, possibly, they have and are unperturbed.) One reason might be that the videos are saved in the FLV format, short for Flash Video. Most default video players can’t read them, but you can watch them in VLC. You can’t preview a .flv file in a file browser, which could make it a little trickier to figure out what videos Facebook has of yours. To find yours, download your data archive — instructions here — and open the file. Select the index, which will open your archive in your web browser. From there, click the video section to see what’s what. (You might need to download the free app VLC player, which can play Flash videos.)","Facebook saving data you didn’t share isn’t an entirely new concern. Back in 2013, then–Facebook intern and Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon Sauvik Das and Adam Kramer, a Facebook data scientist, put together a study on what they deemed “self-censorship” on the platform. Self-censorship, according to their work, was anything a user typed in the status box but ultimately didn’t post.Data that Facebook can track. Facebook’s current data policy says that the company can “collect the content and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share, and message or communicate with others.” “Create” is the operative word in there. By that logic, Facebook technically could save any video a user filmed but did not publish because you created it on the platform. Still, that requires the kind of close read of the fine print that most humans, at least not before Facebook’s ongoing Cambridge Analytica privacy fiasco, likely aren’t taking the time to do.","An industry expert recently told me about another “open secret” — that when Instagram first introduced video, the company would begin uploading a user’s video while they wrote a caption. That way, when the user pressed “post,” the video would already be good to go, and the user wouldn’t have to wait while the video uploaded in real time. Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger explained this in a presentation on the “Secrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design” in 2011. It doesn’t seem unreasonable that a similar system might have been used at Facebook to create a faster, cleaner user experience. Except, unlike Instagram which says it threw out the data if a user cancelled the post, it appears Facebook was keeping the videos.","I reached out to Facebook for comment today, and the company asked me to connect them with Kircher so she could consent to the company investigating why these outtakes were in her data archives. The representative told me the company thinks they’ve “gotten to the bottom of it,” but that Facebook was still figuring out what it could share. Later, a Facebook representative provided a statement saying that the company is still looking into the matter: “We’ve heard that when accessing their information from our Download Your Information tool, some people are seeing their old videos that do not appear on their profile or Activity Log. We are investigating.”","The videos that Stephanis and Kircher found in their archives are pretty harmless, at least in terms of content. But it’s easy to imagine a user filming something that wasn’t quite so juvenile and being horrified to discover that Facebook has a copy. Apropos of, well, everything, now seems like a good time to mention that Mark Zuckerberg keeps a piece of tape over his webcam. Seems like he might be onto something.","Update, March 28, 6:16 p.m.: This piece has been edited to include a statement from Facebook.","If you’ve also found questionable things in your Facebook data archive, I’d love to hear about it.

So my own view is it was much more than 50M.”","We’ve reached out to Facebook about Wylie’s claim — but at the time of writing the company had not provided a response.","“There were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,” Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says users’ data was obtained by CA. “It first started as a very small pilot — firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral register… We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallife deployed via Facebook’s platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014.","“That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.”","The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie.","“This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.”","Facebook has previously confirmed 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it.","Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing.","Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reported that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform.","In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak.","It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes. EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that.","“There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.”","Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, Facebook settled with the FTC over charges it had deceived users by “telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public”.","And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal.","Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.","When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data.","The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data”. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it has also tweeted re: the GSR data.","(Following the session, CA has also now put out a longer response statement, refuting multiple parts of Wylie’s testimony and claiming he has “misrepresented himself and the company”. In this it also claims: “Cambridge Analytica does not hold any GSR data or any data derived from GSR data. We have never shared the GSR data with Aggregate IQ [another alleged affiliate company], Palantir or any other entity. Cambridge Analytica did not use any GSR data in the work that we did for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.”)","Asked by the committee about Nix’s earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”.","“That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data.","Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered.","Kogan also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”.","Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it sought to predict via patterns in the data.","He said:","For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC. And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like.","“That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.”","Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later.","“The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data”","Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms.","Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.”","The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions.","“That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Wylie added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.”","Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.”","The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns.","Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used.","“Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.”","In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: “The source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property.”","Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA.","“It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore.","“But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].”","The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”.","During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform.","“He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted?","“It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.”","We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either.","Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge. They certainly didn’t with me — until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no I’ve actually given over everything to the authorities.”","“I suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016… they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,” he said. “So I don’t think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach that’s going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data,” he added. “It was everywhere.”","FREE BONUS SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD!** Includes Giveaway Rights **","Brought To You By Profit Agency","Free Downloads","Click The Image To Download","Products & Reviews:","There are many elements associated with online trading and whilst it is not for everyone, it's a great deal more simple than many financial advisors would have you think, particularly if you have access to the right, trustworthy information from acknowledged expert sources.

A successful car salesman will do some research before targeting these teenagers, and might find out that many teenagers can’t afford to buy a car. So the savvy salesman will figure out that he needs to target their parents.","This is where the buyer persona is helpful. Creating a buyer persona for your business will help identify the ideal type of customer so you can produce effective content to sell your products, instead of blindly creating blog posts and videos hoping someone will buy from you.","A buyer persona is a detailed profile of your ideal customer, which includes specific details about the customer who’s most likely to buy your product.","Main Elements of a Buyer Persona","Creating a buyer persona is similar to creating a Facebook profile. When you create a buyer persona profile, you include every little detail about your best buyer: their location, age, gender, employment, the company they work for, marital status, interests, their shopping habits, and more.","Every buyer persona should include these four sections:","Personal Background Info: includes details such as job, family, age, income, and gender","What They Want: includes their goals, kinds of challenges they’re facing, and what you can do to provide solutions","Why They Buy Your Product: lists reasons this person would buy your product, which specific problem it solves, and what holds them back from buying","Best Way to Reach: describes the most convenient way to reach this customer and how you would explain your solution","You’re probably wondering how you can find such specific details to create a buyer persona. Well, Facebook has already done that job for you.","When creating a profile on Facebook, people share all of these bits of information with the entire world. Through its advertising platform, Facebook gives all types of businesses access to this user information, which you can use to effectively target your audiences with ad campaigns.","Before you begin, make sure that you’re using Facebook Audience Insights. Facebook Page Insights will only offer limited details related to a specific page. You need to go beyond that.","To access Audience Insights, log into your Facebook account and go to your Ads Manager, open the Explore panel on the left-hand side, and find the Audience Insights link on the drop-down menu.","From here, you can create a custom audience and view all kinds of detailed information related to your audience. You can even segment the data using many different filters; for example, to find parents with children ages 13 to 18 years.

Your email list consists of people who have already shown interest in your products, so it’s more effective for finding your ideal customer traits.","You can download your email list as a CSV file and upload it to Facebook. Then Facebook scans these emails to find the profiles of your leads to create a custom audience. Facebook recommends that you use an email list or a list segment of at least 1,000 people to create a more accurate custom audience.","Go to your Ads Manager and then go to the Audiences page. From the Create Audience menu, select Custom Audience.","Then select the Customer File option to upload your CSV file.","Follow the instructions and complete the process.","Note: It can take up to 72 hours before Audience Insights data is available for your custom audience.","#2: Analyze and Make Note of Audience Characteristics","Now that you have a custom audience made from your existing leads and customers, you can start analyzing your audience to learn more about them.","Go back to the Audience Insights page in Ads Manager.

Make note of the interests and habits of your ideal customer.","Next, switch between tabs to learn the location, the income of the household, and what types of devices they use to browse the web.","More importantly, you can find out what kinds of products they’re most interested in buying.","#3: Create Your Buyer Persona","Once you identify the key data related to your customer, you can start creating a profile to organize all of the information in one place.","Depending on the industry and the type of business you have, you’ll need to create a unique buyer persona to profile the necessary details of your customer for ease of use.","You can create your buyer persona from scratch or you can use a buyer persona template to get an idea of how to create one.

The probe comes after the social network admitted it suspended a firm that worked on behalf of the Trump campaign to use personal information gathered on Facebook to target potential Trump supporters.","Privacy activists and some members of Congress have called for the agency to fully investigate whether the handling of Facebook user data violated a 2011 consent decree with the FTC. The consent decree was the result of a two-year-long investigation by the agency into Facebook's privacy practices.","The current investigation stems from the purchase of personal data by Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm, from a researcher who gathered it by using a Facebook app. The app asked users to take a personality test and then gathered data not only about them but about their friends.","\"This latest scandal will be a test case of whether [the FTC] is willing to put the public before the data gathering industry,\" says Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy rights group. Chester and other advocates charge that the FTC hasn't been keeping a close enough eye on consumer privacy.","But Chris Hoofnagle, who directs the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology at University of California Berkeley, says it isn't clear that Facebook violated the consent decree. According to Hoofnagle, the decree says that Facebook is not liable when users consent to giving their friends' information to Facebook.","However, Hoofnagle thinks what is likely is that once the FTC starts investigating the social network it will find that it has engaged in other illegal practices. Hoofnagle says Facebook attracts developers by making it easy to get personal information. He believes that makes it very tempting for Facebook to overlook breaches of privacy so that they can keep attracting developers.","In a statement, the FTC says it takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Facebook says it will cooperate with the FTC and says it would \"appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.\"","Facebook was also hit with another lawsuit. Cook County, Ill., is suing the company and Cambridge Analytica. Cook County's State Attorney Kimberly M. Fox says both companies violated Illinois' fraud law.","In a statement Fox said, \"Cambridge Analytica deliberately mislead Facebook users by mining — without user's knowledge — information about every Facebook 'friend' of people who took an online 'personality quiz.'\"","The suit also alleges that Facebook engaged in deceptive practices because it represented to the public that strict limitations and protocols on data gathering were in place. Yet, the suit says, Facebook knowingly allowed app developers, including Cambridge Analytica, to accumulate and mine data in excess of these policies.","The Cook County lawsuit is one of several that have been filed since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to private information belonging to tens of millions of Facebook users. Among the lawsuits is one being brought by a Facebook user as a class action case for violation of user privacy. Another case is being brought by a shareholder because of the drop in stock price after the data harvesting was revealed."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

As TechCrunch explained when the data partnership first launched:","“Through new partnerships with top online and offline purchase data providers Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai, Facebook is now allowing advertisers to target hashed lists of existing and potential customers, and categories like role-playing gamers or soda drinkers.”","Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that the change is permanent, not a temporary precaution. In order to leverage the deep pool of data Facebook collects on users, the company mixes information that it obtains from users themselves (Pages a user liked, for instance) with information from advertisers (membership status in a loyalty program, for example) and with data obtained from third party providers.","While Facebook feels comfortable with the integrity of its data sourcing within the first two categories, it feels less settled about dipping into these aggregate pools of third party data. The decision was issued in light of the company’s recent privacy concerns over third-party data mishandling.","Facebook Product Marketing Director Graham Mudd elaborated on the decision in a statement:","“We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories. This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.”","Facebook clarified that it will still work with companies like Experian and Acxiom in order to measure ad performance and provide metrics, although it will also be conducting a review of those ongoing relationships. Facebook may also move toward sharing data in a shared server environment in order to offer further assurances of user privacy.

But to Baillie Gifford — a 110-year-old Scottish investment firm that manages $255 billion — the biggest error is not being in the game at all.","\"For us, a mistake is foregone upside,\" Tom Slater, the firm's head of the US equities, said in an interview with Business Insider. \"Businesses you've missed out on that you looked at that ended up growing, but you didn't own them. That's how you really destroy value for clients.\"","It's this fear of missing the next big thing that informs much of what Baillie Gifford does on the investment front. The firm is not content to wait around for a company's stock price to surge before buying on the open market.","Instead, it's engaged in a relentless pursuit of fledgling companies that possess enormous growth potential — many of which aren't yet public.","There are also companies that are either recently public, like Chinese electric-car maker Nio. Or firms that are on the precipice of an initial public offering, like Eventbrite.","But that's not to overshadow Baillie Gifford's investments in some of the stock market's foremost juggernauts. Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix, and Alibaba are all present in the SMIT.","For us, a mistake is foregone upside.","And then there's Tesla, the holding for which Baillie Gifford is perhaps best known, since it owns a bigger chunk than any institution in the world.","All of these investments have combined to generate an annualized average return of roughly 21% for the SMIT over the past 10 years. That's almost two times the 12% annual return for the FTSE World TR Index, according to Bloomberg data.","Over the past six years — a period that better encompasses the firm's foray into private companies — the SMIT has enjoyed a whopping 26% annual return, again nearly doubling the benchmark.","Whether it's the index-leading performance of the firm's mega-cap tech cohort, the immediate post-IPO returns it's gotten from companies like Nio, or the ever-climbing valuations of Silicon Valley's favorite unicorns, one thing is certain: Baillie Gifford is doing something right.","An important strategic realization","Before we get into how Baillie Gifford has gotten so heavily involved during the early stages of companies, it's valuable to understand why the firm shifted their strategy in the first place.","It all started in the period following the tech bubble. After the market went bust, the century-old firm didn't turn its back on the sector, as many did. Instead, it recognized that some of the industry's growth characteristics were actually valid, and began hunting for cheap opportunities.","\"If we got anything right during that period, it was breaking down some of the barriers that I think the industry in general had sort of imposed on itself,\" Slater, who also co-manages the SMIT and serves as a decision-maker for the firm's long-term global growth strategy, said.","\"What we did quite well was snip the strings that were holding us into that straightjacket,\" he added.","That led to an investment in Amazon in 2004. At a time when the company was still viewed by most as an unprofitable online retailer, Baillie Gifford saw the big-picture potential that's been so crucial to the company's recent success.","Yet while Amazon has performed admirably in the period since — having surged 4,300% since the start of 2005 — Baillie Gifford wasn't yet satisfied. It asked itself why it didn't get into Amazon way back in 1996.","It performed similar soul-searching around its Google investment. The firm had made a pretty penny buying shares in 2008, but what if it had bought on the IPO, back in 2004? By not doing so, they'd missed out on the stock already tripling.","Baillie Gifford decided it needed to get into these companies even earlier. So it set out to do so.","Getting familiar with the venture pipeline","Armed with their new early-stage initiative, Slater and his colleagues set out to make it happen.","\"We realized that we needed to get to know the later stages of the venture pipeline better,\" said Slater. \"We put more effort into building relationships with some of the more interesting venture capitalists, and got to know their portfolio companies.\"","That included Slater — an Edinburgh resident — moving his family to San Francisco for several months on three separate occasions, according to a Bloomberg report. His intention was to network and gain a better understanding of how things work in Silicon Valley.","We realized that we needed to get to know the later stages of the venture pipeline better.","And it appears to have worked, largely because, as Slater notes, companies don't necessarily want to engage in the whole Wall Street song and dance.","\"There's a real open door there, in that these companies don’t want to play Wall Street's game of having their stock pumped out to their best hedge fund clients,\" he said. \"They want to transition their shareholder base over time.\"","Slater also found a receptive audience in the form of venture capitalists, who make seed investments in companies they hope will blossom into something much larger. Since these firms put so much effort into identifying and nurturing young companies, they're similarly hesitant to cede stakes to Wall Street parties that may not share their vision.","\"They want to find partners that can be long-term owners,\" said Slater. \"We built up relationships in that area.\"","Many companies want to stay private longer","Of course, no early-stage investment idea is worth anything unless the company is on board with institutions owning chunks of shares.","But to hear Slater tell it, many upstarts — particularly in the tech space — are keen to circumvent Wall Street traditions like IPOs. Or, at the very least, they're looking to stay private longer.","Slater points out that large-platform companies are so loaded with capital that they don't even really need external financing.","\"Breakthrough businesses enjoy huge scale without getting financial investors,\" he said. \"Therefore, they don’t have financiers running their boardrooms, putting pressure on them to go public.\"","Staying private also saves long-term-focused entrepreneurs from having to constantly answer to an investor base that's obsessed with the near term.","Slater provides the example of Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, who he says has built his company into a juggernaut by thinking carefully about the future. But when Benioff is on quarterly earnings calls, many of the questions are backward-looking and near-sighted. (Note: Baillie Gifford owns a stake in Salesforce.)","\"Entrepreneurs don’t want to spend their time talking about that type of stuff,\" Slater said.","Meanwhile, Baillie Gifford has won companies over by focusing on the big picture. And now, given the firm's track record as a long-term growth partner — one that won't turn its back on a company at the first sign of trouble — the firm has found startups to be responsive to investment inquiries.","This has been a crucial development in Baillie Gifford's stated goal of finding opportunities in their nascent stage, then buying and holding on indefinitely.","Because any number of the companies in Baillie Gifford's portfolio could wind up being the next Amazon. And this time around, they don't want to make the \"mistake\" of waiting too long.","SEE ALSO: There's a 'trap door below the market' — the world's biggest stock bear warns of a recent shift that signals the next big crash is near","Join the conversation about this story »","NOW WATCH: An aerospace company reintroduced its precision helicopter with two crossing motors","The European division of Starbucks paid 2.8% UK tax last year (SBUX)","The European division of Starbucks paid an effective tax rate of 2.8% in the year ending October 2017, after fund transfers between other parts of the business were accounted for, its accounts show.","The company which has faced criticism in the UK for tax avoidance paid just $5.9 million in tax, from UK profits of $213 million, the Financial Times reported.","Company profits in the UK before tax more than halved last year to £4.5 million ($5.9 million), which Starbucks said was because of “challenging” conditions and reduced consumer confidence.","The European division of Starbucks paid an effective tax rate of 2.8% in the year ending October 2017, after taking into account payment transfers from other parts of the business, the Financial Times reported.","The coffee brand which has faced criticism in the past for the amount of tax it pays revealed that its largest European operation paid just $5.9 million in tax, from UK profits of $213 million.","The profit in the operation was increased by a $150 million dividend from another group entity on which Starbucks had already paid tax.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

It can also mine data from Facebook and sift GPS location information from Foursquare, a mobile phone app used by more than 25 million people to alert friends of their whereabouts. The Foursquare data can be used to display, in graph form, the top 10 places visited by tracked individuals and the times at which they visited them.","The video shows that Nick, who posts his location regularly on Foursquare, visits a gym frequently at 6am early each week.

It’s possible that an investigation could lead to enforcement action and fines for Facebook. A representative for FTC told BuzzFeed News the agency had no additional comment on the investigation.","This isn’t the first time Facebook has been dinged by the FTC over user privacy. In 2011, Facebook and the FTC reached a settlement over charges that it deceived its users in a variety of ways, including: sharing posts that were marked “Friends Only” with third-party apps, storing data after users deleted their accounts, and sharing user data with advertisers after promising it wouldn’t. As part of the settlement, Facebook had to agree to several measures of transparency about user privacy, including \"giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtaining their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings,\" preventing anyone from accessing data from deleted accounts, and getting a third-party privacy checkup every two years.","The user data taken by a researcher through a quiz app that was later sold to Cambridge Analytica happened in 2014, years after the FTC settlement. \"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,\" according to a statement in Monday's FTC release.","Here is the full statement by Tom Pahl, acting director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection:","The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers.

Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.

It’s an indictment focused on a specific set of charges targeting a specific group of people — 13 in total. It doesn’t include, for example, any discussion of how Russia might have hacked the Democratic National Committee or the Hillary Clinton campaign. It doesn’t include evidence that senior Trump campaign officials colluded with Russia deliberately to affect the outcome of the race.

It shows a concerted years-long effort by a group dedicated to undermining the American political system.

Point in fact, here is a press release from this morning, with reaction to the current Facebook/ Cambridge Analytica mess from Illinois, the Land of Lincoln (speaking of leaders…)","Cook County State’s Attorney Kimberly M. Foxx today announced that her office has filed a consumer fraud lawsuit against Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”) and SCL Group Limited and Cambridge Analytica LLC (“Cambridge Analytica”) over Cambridge Analytica’s improper harvesting of Facebook user data and Facebook’s failure to adequately protect that data. This resulted in the exploitation of personal data of 50 million Facebook users with the express purpose of influencing the 2016 presidential election.","State’s Attorney Foxx, on behalf of the People of the State of Illinois, filed the complaint in the Chancery Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County. The complaint raises claims under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.","“Cambridge Analytic deliberately misled Facebook users so it could build psychological profiles of the user and their friends, and Facebook did not stop it,” said State’s Attorney Foxx. “This blatant deception violated Illinois law and more importantly violated the privacy of Illinois residents. Cambridge Analytica and Facebook must be held accountable for their actions.”","The suit alleges Cambridge Analytica used fraudulent and deceptive practices to gain information about 50 million Facebook users by mining – without users’ knowledge – information about every Facebook “friend” of people who took an online “personality quiz.” This improperly obtained data was used to create “psychographic profiles” on millions of American voters, with the purpose of influencing the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.","The suit further alleges that Facebook engaged in deceptive practices by maintaining formal polices and representing to the public that strict limitations and protocols on data gathering were in place, while knowingly allowing app developers, including Cambridge Analytica, to accumulate and mine data vastly in excess of those policies.","Upon learning of Cambridge Analytica’s actions, Facebook failed to take adequate corrective action or disclose the violation of its privacy policies to consumers. Its response was limited to a single private request to Cambridge Analytica to delete the data. Facebook took no further action, nor did they notify the “friends” whose data was accessed, until the public revelation of the breach in the media, at which point it finally and for the first time suspended Cambridge Analytica’s Facebook account.","The lawsuit seeks civil penalties and fines under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.","The People are seeking representation by the outside law firm Edelson PC in this litigation.

I guess that’s all they have left,” he said.","Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the “Wild West.”","“Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","With Republicans controlling the Senate’s majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail.","The New York Times and London’s Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted despite Facebook’s demands beginning in 2015.","Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015.

{"originalurl":"https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/facebook-cambridge-analytica-and-trump-what-you-need-to-know/","title":"Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal: From Trump to data mining - CNET","text":["Last month, The New York Times and the UK's Guardian and Observer newspapers broke news the social networking giant was duped by researchers, who reportedly gained access to the data of millions of Facebook users and then may have misused it for political ads during the 2016 US presidential election. Facebook said it was investigating the reports, which involved data consultancy Cambridge Analytica.","Over the past three-plus weeks, the situation has snowballed. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was in Washington this week to testify before Congress. Meanwhile, the number of accounts affected has risen to 87 million from initial reports of 50 million. Separately, Facebook said it was purging pages linked to a Russian troll farm that's known for creating fake online identities and posting on both sides of politically divisive issues.","Cambridge Analytica reportedly acquired the data in a way that violated the social network's policies. It then reportedly tapped the information to build psychographic profiles of users and their friends, which were used for targeted political ads in the UK's Brexit referendum campaign, as well as by Trump's team during the 2016 US election.","Facebook says it told Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, but reports suggest the info wasn't destroyed. Cambridge Analytica says it complies with the social network's rules, only receives data \"obtained legally and fairly,\" and did wipe out the data Facebook is worried about.","Here's what you need to know.","Now playing:Watch this:\nDid Facebook lose control of your information?","3:28","What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a UK-based data analytics firm, whose parent company is Strategic Communication Laboratories. Cambridge Analytica helps political campaigns reach potential voters online. The firm combines data from multiple sources, including online information and polling, to build \"profiles\" of voters. It then uses computer programs to predict voter behavior, which could be influenced through specialized advertisements aimed at the voters.","\"We have lots of history of things,\" Nix said in the videos, \"I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done.\"","Nix has since been suspended from his job as CEO. His comments \"do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,\" the company said in a statement.","What did Cambridge Analytica do?","Facebook said in a statement on March 16 that Cambridge Analytica received user data from Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge. Kogan reportedly created an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" that ostensibly offered personality predictions to users while calling itself a research tool for psychologists.","The app asked users to log in using their Facebook accounts. As part of the login process, it asked for access to users' Facebook profiles, locations, what they liked on the service, and importantly, their friends' data as well.","Facebook's data appears to have been improperly used for political purposes during the UK's Brexit vote and the 2016 US presidential election.","Getty Images","The problem, Facebook says, is that Kogan then sent this user data to Cambridge Analytica without user permission, something that's against the social network's rules.","\"Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement.","Kogan didn't respond to requests for comment. The New York Times said he cited nondisclosure agreements and declined to provide details about what happened, saying his personality prediction program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\"","Cambridge Analytica also worked with other 2016 presidential election campaigns, according to its website and various media reports. Those included the campaigns of Sen. Ted Cruz and candidate Ben Carson, who went on to join Trump's cabinet as secretary of housing and urban development.","Why did Facebook ban Cambridge Analytica from its service?","Facebook said Cambridge Analytica \"certified\" three years ago it had deleted the information, as did Kogan. But since then, Facebook said, it's received reports that not all the user data was deleted. The New York Times reported at the outset of this controversy that at least some of it remains.","Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that it deleted all the data and is in contact with Facebook about the issue.","\"I'm actually really confused by Facebook,\" Wylie said. \"They make me out to be this suspect or some kind of nefarious person.\"","Was Facebook hacked?","The New York Times characterized the original problem as a data \"breach\" and said it's \"one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history.\" That's in part because the roughly 270,000 users who gave Kogan access to their information allowed him to collect data on their friends as well. In total, more than 87 million Facebook users are said to have been affected.","Facebook, however, says that while Kogan mishandled its data, all the information Kogan got was accessed legally and within its rules. The problem is that Kogan was supposed to hold on to the information himself, not hand it over to Cambridge Analytica or anyone else. Because the information was accessed through normal means, Facebook disputes the characterization of the incident as a breach.","\"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" the company said.","Wait, so Facebook allows apps to access my data?","When you log in to an app using your Facebook account, the developer typically asks for access to information the social network has. Sometimes it's just your name and email address. Other times, it's your location and your friends' data too.","All this is pretty much what any app developer that works with Facebook was allowed to do until 2015, when Facebook prevented app developers from accessing friends' data. Everything else, though, is still fair game.","Facebook says its rules specify that developers can't share the information they receive with other firms. That's where the problem with Kogan and Cambridge Analytica comes up.","The company has an app review process it puts developers through. Once they're cleared, things are A-OK.","Facebook, by the way, is hoping to stop the next Cambridge Analytica. It's offered a bounty to anyone who finds apps that misuse Facebook data. The company has also revamped its tools to help you identify which apps have access to your data, as well as those to strengthen security of your profile. Facebook also made it easier to download data it has on you.","Could this lead to more regulation?","Zuckerberg himself said it might.","\"I'm actually not sure we shouldn't be regulated,\" he said in an interview with CNN on March 21. \"The question is, what is the right regulation?\"","He answered that question on April 6, saying he supports the Honest Ads Act, a proposed law that would require tech companies to disclose how political ads are targeted and how much they cost.","Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are looking for answers from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.","James Martin/CNET","Regardless of whether that bill becomes a law, there's one thing we know for sure: The honeymoon between the tech industry and government is over. After decades of (mostly) treating tech companies as favored children, legislators and government regulators are increasingly taking a tougher stance against them.","\"This latest fiasco could reignite the debate within the Beltway and EU around a tighter regulatory environment Facebook and its social platform brethren could face going forward,\" Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights, wrote in a note to investors right after the controversy erupted. \"This represents another critical period for Facebook to hand hold and assure its users and regulators around tighter content standards and platform security in light of this latest PR nightmare.\"","\"Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook,\" the agency said in a statement on March 26. \"Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.\"","The consent decree required that Facebook must get users to agree to and must notify them about the social network sharing their data. Facebook earlier told The Washington Post it rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\"","In Europe, where regulators have traditionally taken a tough stance on social media and privacy, the president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, tweeted that EU lawmakers \"will investigate fully, calling digital platforms to account.\" In the UK, Damian Collins, the chair of Parliament's committee overseeing digital matters, said Zuckerberg needs to stand up and answer questions directly.","What happened in Zuckerberg's appearance before Congress?","A little over three weeks after the Cambridge Analytica news broke, Zuckerberg went to Washington, where over two days he endured 10 hours of questioning by congressional committees. Echoing earlier statements, he apologized to lawmakers for Facebook's recent missteps and voiced support for some regulation of the tech industry.","In his first day of testimony, he did score some points. Zuckerberg addressed a room full of Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committee members who struggled to understand what Facebook does, how the social platform works, and how to regulate it. He escaped largely unscathed, having settled into his role as both an explainer of technology and a receiver of the occasional finger-wag.","But on day two, things got a little rougher. His appearance before the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee was defined by pointed questions from lawmakers who appeared to have done their homework.","Some, like New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, hammered Zuckerberg on default privacy settings. California Rep. Anna Eshoo asked Zuckerberg if his own data was swept up in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (He said that it was.) And Florida Rep. Kathy Castor and New Mexico Rep. Ben Lujan raised concerns about how much Facebook follows people as they browse the web -- and whether people without accounts on the social media network still get tracked via \"shadow profiles.\" Zuckerberg said that he wasn't familiar with that term and that Facebook collects data on nonusers for security purposes.","\"Your business is built on trust, and you're losing trust,\" Lujan said.","But apparently Facebook hasn't lost Wall Street's confidence. The company's shares rose approximately 5 percent over the two days of testimony.","Was this similar to what the Obama campaign did on Facebook?","Sort of. The Obama campaign did collect a similar level of data from its app, which includes both your information and your friend's information.","But as Politifact notes, users were willingly giving up that information and knew it was going to a political campaign. The Obama campaign used your friend's data to figure out who may or may not be willing to vote for him, and sent messages to users to persuade their friends.","That's different from the Cambridge Analytica situation, since most users taking the digital life quiz had no idea that the data would be used for political purposes.","What's Facebook doing about this?","After five long days, Zuckerberg broke his silence on March 21 with a nearly 1,000-word post on his Facebook page. (C'mon, did you really expect it to show up on Twitter?) The post was his first since since March 2, when he shared a photo of his family celebrating the Jewish holiday of Purim.","Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes with users' information. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data,\" he wrote. \"And if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.\"","He's since sat down for several media interviews, and on April 4, held an hour-long conference call with journalists. \"Life is learning from mistakes,\" Zuckerberg said. \"At the end of the day, this is my responsibility. I started this place, I run it, I'm responsible.\"","The company, he said, is now facing two central questions: \"Can we get our systems under control and second, can we make sure that our systems aren't used to undermine democracy,\" Zuckerberg said.","\"It's not enough to give people a voice, we have to make sure that people are not using that voice to spread disinformation,\" he added.","We have a responsibility to protect your data. And if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg","He's promised to investigate apps that had access to \"large amounts of information\" before the company made changes to how much information third-party apps could access in 2018. Facebook will conduct a full audit of apps that exhibit suspicious behavior and bar developers who don't agree to audits.","Facebook's public missteps have brought up other concerns about Facebook too. One example is a memo leaked to BuzzFeed penned by Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth, a top Facebook executive. The 2016 memo advocates growth above everything else, regardless of whether people use Facebook to bully and harass one another.","\"The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good,\" he wrote at the time. He's since said he was trying to stir debate, and didn't agree with what he'd written.","The company is also planning to further restrict political advertising, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's COO, said in an interview with Bloomberg. \"If you were using hate-based language in ads for elections, we're drawing those lines much tighter and applying them uniformly,\" she said.","Last, Facebook will begin displaying a gauge at the top of your News Feed that lets you know which apps you've used and let you revoke their permissions.","We're also starting to see some action that could hit Facebook in the wallet. Within days of the scandal erupting, Firefox maker Mozilla said it would no longer advertise on Facebook because of data privacy concerns, and it launched a petition to ask the social network to improve its privacy settings. Meanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has taken a different kind of stand. Prompted by an inquiry from a Twitter user, he quickly deleted both companies' Facebook pages. So did Playboy, for what it's worth.","Ultimately, reform is what's needed, said former Cambridge Analytica executive Brittany Kaiser. \"For many years, I never questioned it,\" Kaiser said. \"That's the way that the political system works. That's the way that advertising works. That's the way that every single industry that exists in the entire basis of digital communications works. I do really understand the industry, and I have the ability to be a voice for change.\"","What can I do?","There isn't much. You may've been swept up in this without even knowing it. You don't have to have downloaded Kogan's app to have had your information accessed, since the statements and articles say the app slurped up information about users' friends.","Cambridge Analytica also doesn't appear to offer a way for you to request your information be removed from its systems. The company didn't respond to a request for comment.","As for Facebook, you can always try to lodge a complaint with Zuckerberg."],"isopubdate":"2018-04-19"}

If you have an Android device, you might be particularly interested in the number of times your device incorrectly thought you said “OK Google”, and duly uploaded an audio recording of everything that was being said.","Governments can do more to stop companies from easily harvesting our personal data. Picture: Pexels","Many people who have downloaded their Facebook data have been unpleasantly surprised to find that it included phone call and text metadata they didn’t know Facebook was collecting.","In the wake of the furore over Facebook’s data sharing and its exploitation by data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, the Australian Prime Minister’s special advisor on cyber security, Alistair MacGibbon, has deftly called out the real issue. “These companies that hold up privacy, and the sanctity of the individual, to us as governments – western, liberal, democratic governments – are the same ones that are then allowing data at the back end to go off out of their control.”","Clearly, if we’re relying on Facebook to uphold our privacy and the sanctity of the individual against our democratically elected government then we’re in deep strife. What should be done? We argue that the best solution is more user control and less data collection.","Why liberal democracies are vulnerable","Detailed knowledge about a person can be exploited for political purposes. One of the allegations against Cambridge Analytica (which it denies) is that it used Facebook data to promote Donald Trump’s US presidential campaign. Targeted advertising is, after all, exactly what Facebook actually sells.","There are two important implications for elections. The first is the opportunity for using data to micro-target inconsistent messages, so that different parts of the electorate vote for the same person, expecting completely different policies. This was always possible, but it’s worse online, and harder to detect.","But it’s very unclear how well it works, or what the data is exactly. The best we know is from some data on US voters accidentally left on an unprotected server by the Republican National Committee in 2017. It contained detailed information on over 198 million (i.e. almost all) US voters, including demographic data and political inclinations.","Note, however, manipulation like this may not always work – Cambridge Analytica tried but failed in Nigeria.","Governments that tolerate a lot less political freedom also use this data to keep tabs on their own citizens. The Chinese Communist Party monitors its citizens as part of its social credit system. Apple was justly criticised for its recent decision to store decryption keys for iCloud storage in China. This would allow Chinese officials who could access those keys to decrypt Apple users’ cloud storage, though their end-to-end encrypted messaging.","what you can do","There are of course steps that we can all take to better safeguard our data. It may be a little late to delete Facebook, but you could at least stop giving Facebook new information about yourself – run an ad blocker, browse in private browsing mode, and turn off third-party cookies.","You can buy a cover (or just use some tape) for every device camera you take into the bedroom or bathroom, and get them for your kids too. And if you’ve found a good microphone cover, email us!","Be wary of always-on recording devices providing services like digital assistants. If you buy an always-on recording device for your home, it will be… always-on, recording, in your home.","Use end-to-end encrypted communications, like Signal, Wickr, WhatsApp, iMessage and FaceTime. If it’s properly implemented, this means that the decryption key is held only by the person you’re talking to - even the company that sells the software can’t read it. Try to find an end-to-end encrypted cloud storage provider, so that you are the only person with the decryption key to your cloud storage.","But all this data is useful for catching terrorists and paedophiles isn’t it? Perhaps, but according to Apple’s transparency report Australia is third in terms of number of requests for access to devices, behind Germany and the US, which both have much larger populations.","Some targeted surveillance is, of course, a necessary part of keeping everyone safe – the question is how much, and to what extent companies should be obliged to gather extra data just in case. A recent report from the US Department of Justice suggests that the FBI may have not exhausted all its options for accessing the iPhone data of San Bernadino terrorist Syed Farook, but that some in the FBI wanted it to seem hard, so as to pursue an “agenda of obtaining a favorable court ruling against Apple.”","What governments could do","But what should liberal democratic governments do? Even Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is “not sure we shouldn’t be regulated.” The best government response to this controversy would be to work to decrease data acquisition and sharing.","It could mandate easy, ubiquitous opt-outs. When the “OK Google” button comes up on your phone, you should get an obvious and easy option that says “disable this feature and never upload my audio.”","Zuckerberg says “there are things like ad transparency regulation that I would love to see.” So would we.","There’s nothing wrong with government asking companies for data that they have, given an appropriate warrant. But it’s in the best interests of Australia’s security to disincentivise massive data gathering and encourage end-to-end encrypted communications and secure, user-controlled devices. Then companies like Facebook, Google and Cambridge Analytica and their (real) customers will have less data about Australians to share and exploit.","Privacy Statement","The University of Melbourne (University) collects, uses, handles and discloses personal information in accordance with the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 (Vic) (Act) and other applicable legislation.","This Privacy Statement relates only to the collection of personal information in relation to the Pursuit Website.

{"originalurl":"https://thebea.st/2G8X1mX?source=facebook&via=desktop","title":"Stormy Daniels’ Legal Strategy Strongly Suggests She Has Photos of Donald Trump","text":["Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast","Daniels is arguing that the October 26, 2016, agreement she signed accepting money in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Donald Trump is null and void because it was not signed by Trump himself.","On its surface, this is a poor strategy. While cloaked in pseudonyms, the agreement itself says that it is between three parties: “David Dennison,” i.e. Trump; “Peggy Peterson,” i.e. Stormy Daniels / Stephanie Clifford; and “Essential Consultants” (EC), a consulting company formed by Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, apparently expressly for the purpose of signing this agreement and paying Daniels $130,000 in hush money.","Weirdly, the agreement actually says it is between “EC, LLC and/or David Dennison, on the one part” and Daniels on the other. That “and/or” is quite unusual in the recitation of parties to a contract. Either the parties are signatories, or they’re not.","The only plausible interpretation of this unusual “and/or” suggests that either EC or Trump is sufficient for the agreement to be binding. The non-signature of Trump/Dennison shouldn’t matter.","Moreover, Daniels took the money and, at first, complied with the agreement. As first-year law students learn in school, there’s an offer, there’s acceptance, and there’s consideration – there’s a contract. In fact, courts generally go out of their way to enforce imperfect contracts, even absent these extenuating circumstances. Avenatti’s argument is a reach.","It also seems weirdly unnecessary because we already know about the contract and the alleged affair.","I’ve reviewed dozens, if not hundreds, of non-disclosure agreements in my life. Pretty much all of them become voided once the confidential information becomes widely known. That’s true even of agreements like this one, which is unusually constructed, outrageously slanted toward one party (guess which one) and intended to keep Daniels silent throughout all eternity and the entire universe no matter what.","In this case, when the Wall Street Journal revealed the details of the contract on January 12, 2018, that information stopped being confidential.","“I’ve reviewed dozens, if not hundreds, of non-disclosure agreements in my life. Pretty much all of them become voided once the confidential information becomes widely known.”","So why not just say that? Why not cite the WSJ report, say the information is no longer confidential, and that’s that? Why seek a declaratory judgment voiding the agreement based on a flimsy theory that Avenatti must know is risky at best?","The answer may be in the agreement itself, because it has some unusual provisions in it.","First, it’s chiefly concerned with “certain still images and/or text messages.” Yes, later in the agreement, the “confidential information” at issue is expansively defined, to include absolutely anything, tangible or intangible, that Daniels might know about Trump, including, of course, whether she spanked him with a magazine or not.","But far more ink is spilled discussing what Daniels is supposed to do with those texts and images: give copies to Cohen and destroy the originals.","Now the strategy starts to make sense. This dispute isn’t about the affair: it’s about those pictures or texts. As viewers of Daniels’ 60 Minutes interview surely noticed, the only question Daniels refused to answer was about whether she’s got more evidence of the affair. Avenatti suggested the answer is yes: he tweeted a photo of a DVD inside a safe.","If Daniels has retained copies of pictures or texts, then she is in clear violation of the central parts of the confidentiality agreement. Not only does the agreement explicitly forbid her from keeping copies of images or texts, it actually defines them as Trump’s – oh, sorry, David Dennison’s – personal, copyrighted property.","Incidentally, that, too, is quite unusual. Normally, that kind of provision appears in a consultancy or employment agreement. Here, however, it’s been grafted into a confidentiality agreement. If that DVD has pictures of Trump, it is literally Trump’s copyrighted property.","Unless, of course, the agreement is null and void.","Now the pieces come together. Avenatti wants to void the agreement because that way, Daniels can keep that DVD, or, if you want to be cynical about it, auction it off to the highest bidder.","That DVD could be the stained blue dress of this whole scandal: proof positive that the affair took place, that the coverup took place, and that Cohen and Trump are liars.","Then again, it might just be a blank DVD in a safe.","Now you can see why Avenatti is pursuing this weird and unlikely strategy to say that the agreement was never valid in the first place: that’s the only way for that DVD to matter.","Daniels’s statements so far are most likely not violations of the confidentiality agreement, because the information in them is no longer confidential. But whatever’s on that DVD – and all the devastating power incriminating texts or images would have – still is confidential."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

And when Kogan passed on their data to Cambridge Analytica, he violated platform policies against sharing information with a third party.","Facebook says it learned about what happened in 2015 and removed the app, then demanded Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and SCL destroy the data. Facebook says it was assured by each entity the data was gone.","Now Facebook says it recently learned those assurances may have been false.","\"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" Facebook Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement Friday. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.\"","Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing.","In its own statement, it concedes it contracted with and received data from Global Science Research, a company led by Kogan, but says that when it learned that the user information was not obtained in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted all of it.","Cambridge Analytica says it is committed to receiving information in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act \"and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","To what extent the Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica were intertwined remains murky.","Billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer, who donated to the Trump campaign, backs Cambridge Analytica, having invested millions of dollars in the company. And Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon sat on its board, even naming the company, according The New York Times.","According to the newspaper, \"the firm was effectively a shell\" based in the U.K. and run by foreigners whose contracts with American campaigns — including that of presidential hopeful Ted Cruz — possibly violated Federal Election Commission rules. (The Times interviewed Wylie, who has since left the company and runs another firm.)","The Trump campaign says it briefly used Cambridge Analytica for TV ads and paid some of its data employees, according to The Associated Press.","But congressional investigators have questioned CEO Alexander Nix about the company's role in the campaign.","Nix said last fall that the firm reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the runup to the election to request emails connected to the Hillary Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks said no. It was around the same time that Cambridge began working for the Trump campaign, reports The Wall Street Journal.","The Journal also reports that the firm has become ensnared in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.","And yet as the firm sought to build \"psychographic profiles\" to help discern whom Internet users are and how political messaging might be tailored to them, it turned to Kogan, the Cambridge University psychology professor. The Times says Kogan created the app using a technique developed at the school's Psychometrics Centre, which is designed to map personality traits based Facebook likes. Kogan then put the app on Facebook under the false pretense of using it for academic purposes.","All told, the Times says Kogan handed over more than 50 million profiles to Cambridge Analytica, including information from app users' friends — who had never consented to forgoing their data. Around 30 million of those profiles contained enough information to build psychographic profiles, the newspaper says.","The firm said in its statement, \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Facebook says it will take legal action if it finds something unlawful occurred."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The move comes as regulators and consumers start to pay closer attention to data privacy and security in light of recent revelations about the abuse of user data on big tech platforms.","Why it matters: Obscure data practices have been used for years in the ad tech industry to monetize as much user data as possible. Efforts by industry groups and regulators to rein in those practices could have a significant impact on the way advertisers spend their marketing budgets online.","A recent eMarketer poll suggests that the percentage of ad spend that will go to Facebook and Google this year will decline.","Facebook and Google will capture 56.8% of the U.S. digital ad market this year, compared with 58.5% last year.","Meanwhile, several big brands, like Subway and Procter and Gamble, say they are pulling back ad dollars from some of the bigger tech platforms, in a move of defiance.","The shifts could signal that marketers are ready to move dollars from open platforms that rely mostly on user-generated content to companies with tighter content scrutiny, like Apple, Amazon and Snapchat.","The big picture: Marketers' efforts are happening in conjunction with moves by regulators to focus on data privacy and security.","The FTC confirmed Monday that it has an open non-public investigation into the privacy practices of Facebook.","While analysts don't think the body will fine Facebook out of business, it does put pressure on Facebook and its competitors to be transparent about any other data privacy abuses from the past and to comply with Europe's sweeping privacy regulations that take effect in May.","On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee became the third panel on Capitol Hill to ask Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in front of Congress, following in the footsteps of calls from the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Commitee last week. Lawmakers are calling on the CEO's of Google and Twitter to testify before Congress on April 10, as well as Mark Zuckerberg.","Meanwhile, regulators in Europe, which have historically taken the lead on these issues, have suggested that the EU was considering breaking up Google. \"We are not there yet but it is important to keep an awakened eye,\" EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told The Daily Telegraph Monday.","Investor and consumer confidence is plunging in wake of the scandals.","Facebook stock hit its lowest point since July2017 yesterday in light of the investigation announcement. Scandals surrounding data privacy have dragged the stocks of other social media companies, like Google, Snapchat and Twitter, down with it.","Facebook's favorability has dropped in the last five months, falling twice as far as the other tech giants, according to an exclusive poll for Axios by SurveyMonkey. Favorability towards Google, Twitter, Amazon and Apple have also decreased.","Only about four out of 10 Americans (41%) trust Facebook to comply with U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday.","Calls for action have not occurred overnight.","In Washington, trade associations like Digital Content Next have been sounding the alarm on these issues for years. DCN's President Jason Kint began writing op-eds about the issues of Facebook's data collection going beyond consumer expectations as far back as 2014.","Some trade bodies are concerned that efforts to regulate digital marketing in response to recent crises may undermine existing industry efforts.","\"What is critical is that whatever regulation or other steps that are taken be done very judiciously and carefully to not undermine legitimate efforts in the advertising sector that have fostered the robust growth and health of the Internet and mobile media,\" says Dan Jaffe, EVP of Policy for the Association of National Advertisers.","Editor's note: Mozilla was removed from the current list of big brands, like Subway and Procter and Gamble, who say they're pulling back ad dollars."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone – including the Trump campaign – who might potentially use this data from Facebook’s platform."],"isopubdate":""}
