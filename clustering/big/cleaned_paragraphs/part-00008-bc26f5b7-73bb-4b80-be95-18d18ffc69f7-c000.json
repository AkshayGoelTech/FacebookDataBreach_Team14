The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","\"For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,\" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. \"I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.\"","The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized \"the right to be forgotten,\" allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","\"The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,\" said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking \"I Agree.\" The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to \"bracket off\" European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.","\"Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,\" she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. \"We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,\" it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","\"Cambridge Analytica's story sounds like a spy novel,\" he said. \"It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,\" he said. \"We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Read the latest, here.","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s legal team was poised for a shake-up on Monday, according to two people briefed on the matter, as he openly discussed firing one of his lawyers, another considered resigning and a third — who pushed theories on television that Mr. Trump was framed by the F.B.I. — joined the roster.","Mr. Trump has weighed aloud in recent days to close associates whether to dismiss his lawyer Ty Cobb, who had pushed most strongly a strategy of cooperating fully with the special counsel investigation. The president reassured Mr. Cobb that he had no plans to fire him, according to a person who spoke with the president late Monday, in part to prevent a narrative that his team was in disarray after The New York Times began making inquiries.","Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer, John Dowd, has contemplated leaving his post because he has concluded that he has no control over the behavior of the president, the two people briefed on the matter said. Ignoring his lawyers’ advice, Mr. Trump has reverted to a more aggressive strategy of publicly assailing the inquiry that he initially adopted in the weeks immediately after the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed. Now the president has begun attacking Mr. Mueller himself.","The shift in tone appears to be a product of the president’s concern that the investigation into possible ties between his associates and Russia’s election interference is bearing down on him more directly. And the legal team’s collapse comes as his lawyers are confronting one of their most critical tasks: advising the president on whether to agree to sit for an interview with the special counsel’s office.","Mr. Dowd said he had no plans to leave the team. “I’m sitting here working on the president’s case right now,” he said in a telephone interview on Monday night. Mr. Cobb has told people that the president has recently implored him to stay.","In another sign of the president’s more aggressive posture, on Monday he hired Joseph E. diGenova, a longtime Washington lawyer who has appeared regularly on Fox News in recent months to claim that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department had manufactured evidence against Mr. Trump to aid Hillary Clinton.","“There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”","Little evidence has emerged to support that theory.","Mr. Trump is also discussing adding other lawyers to the team, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.","The tumult marked the greatest instability on the team since Mr. Trump pushed aside his personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, last summer, and was passed over by many of Washington’s top lawyers before he settled on his current crop of attorneys.","“It’s never a good idea to see legal teams change dramatically and for competent lawyers to be replaced by others,” said Roger Cossack, a longtime legal analyst. “It shows that there is chaos and that whoever the client is — in this case the president — is unhappy and is searching for the magic bullet. And it’s never a great strategy to search for the magic bullet. The president clearly wants it to end and wants to put an end to it.”","Mr. Cobb, Mr. Dowd and another lawyer, Jay Sekulow, took over last summer from Mr. Kasowitz, a feisty New Yorker who had represented Mr. Trump in high-profile lawsuits and urged an aggressive posture toward Mr. Mueller, who was appointed last May.","Mr. Trump insisted to his lawyers that he did nothing wrong and they pushed for cooperation with the special counsel, arguing it was his best way to have his name cleared. Working inside the White House, Mr. Cobb oversaw the production of thousands of pages of documents and emails that were turned over to Mr. Mueller’s office and said that the president should not assert executive privilege over the records to keep from slowing the process. The lawyers told the president they hoped to get Mr. Mueller to acknowledge by the end of the year that Mr. Trump was not a target of the investigation.","Mr. Mueller’s investigation is continuing.","As it goes forward, Mr. Trump has questioned his lawyers’ approach and clashed with them about whether to be interviewed by Mr. Mueller. The president believes he is his best spokesman and can explain to Mr. Mueller that he did nothing wrong. The lawyers see little upside.","Image","John Dowd, the president’s lead lawyer, said he had no plans to leave the legal team.CreditBrendan Mcdermid/Reuters","Mr. Dowd and Mr. Sekulow became concerned about their standing with the president in the past two weeks after they learned Mr. Trump had met with another veteran lawyer, Emmet Flood, who represented President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings, about joining the team.","Both publicly and privately, Mr. Trump tried to reassure his lawyers that they had not fallen out of favor with him. “I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter, assailing a New York Times article about his discussions with Mr. Flood. “They are doing a great job.”","Mr. Dowd, in turn, called on the Justice Department over the weekend to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at first that he was speaking for the president, but later backtracked. But according to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging.","Mr. Dowd’s statement set off a stream of negative coverage of Mr. Trump on cable television, to which he is closely attuned. His lawyers were criticized for being undisciplined, and Mr. Dowd’s remarks prompted concern that the president was going to order that Mr. Mueller be fired. Mr. Cobb tried to douse that speculation on Sunday, saying that the president was not considering dismissing the special counsel.","The president’s newest lawyer, Mr. diGenova, has worked in Washington legal circles for decades, including as a United States attorney for the District of Columbia appointed by President Ronald Reagan. He has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about Bill Clinton, then a presidential candidate.","Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. She has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince also attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.","Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about Mrs. Clinton.","Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role be narrowed. In 1999, Congress let the portions of the law allowing for an independent counsel expire.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump May Reshuffle Legal Team to Take On Mueller More Aggressively.

Read the latest, here.","WASHINGTON — The 2020 census will ask respondents whether they are United States citizens, the Commerce Department announced Monday night, agreeing to a Trump administration request with highly charged political and social implications that many officials feared would result in a substantial undercount.","In a statement released Monday, the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had “determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire is necessary to provide complete and accurate census block level data,” allowing the department to accurately measure the portion of the population eligible to vote.","But his decision immediately invited a legal challenge: Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, plans to sue the Trump administration over the decision, a spokeswoman for Mr. Becerra said late Monday.","Image","A census form from 2010, which did not ask about citizenship status.CreditPaul J. Richards/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images","Critics of the change and experts in the Census Bureau itself have said that, amid a fiery immigration debate, the inclusion of a citizenship question could prompt immigrants who are in the country illegally not to respond. That would result in a severe undercount of the population — and, in turn, faulty data for government agencies and outside groups that rely on the census. The effects would also bleed into the redistricting of the House and state legislatures in the next decade.","The Justice Department had requested the change in December, arguing that asking participants about their citizenship status in the decennial census would help enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which aims to prevent voting rights violations.","“The Justice Department is committed to free and fair elections for all Americans, and has sought reinstatement of the citizenship question on the census to fulfill that commitment,” a Justice Department spokesman, Devin M. O’Malley, told The New York Times in February.","“I find that the need for accurate citizenship data and the limited burden that the reinstatement of the citizenship question would impose outweigh fears about a potentially lower response rate,” he wrote.","The decennial census generally included a citizenship inquiry for more than 100 years through 1950, according to the Commerce Department. And other, smaller population surveys, such as the Current Population Survey and the American Community Survey, continue to ask respondents about it.","But critics dismissed administration officials’ reassurances.","“The census numbers provide the backbone for planning how our communities can grow and thrive in the coming decade,” said Mr. Becerra. “What the Trump administration is requesting is not just alarming, it is an unconstitutional attempt to discourage an accurate census count.”","Others argued that an undercount in regions with high immigrant populations would lead not only to unreliable data but also to unfair redistricting, to the benefit of Republicans.","“Adding this question will result in a bad census — deeply flawed population data that will skew public and private sector decisions to ensure equal representation, allocate government resources and anticipate economic growth opportunities — for the next 10 years,” Vanita Gupta, the chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and a deputy attorney general in the Obama administration, said in a statement Monday night. “The stakes are too high to allow this. We urge Congress to overturn this error in judgment.”","The announcement of the citizenship question comes at a troublesome time for the Census Bureau: Its top two positions have interim occupants, and it has been forced to skip two of its three trial runs for the 2020 census because of funding shortfalls. If response rates for the census are low, critics worry that the bureau may be unable to adjust the data or deploy enough census takers to low-response communities.","The bureau is required to submit a final list of the 2020 census questions to Congress by the end of March.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Despite Concerns, Census Will Ask Respondents if They Are U.S. Citizens.

That's because they are, relatively, civilized people, much like many black Americans.\"","The post later says the \"militarization\" of police is necessary and again uses the N-word. The post also uses the N-word in describing black-on-black murders.","In January, KFile unearthed shocking comments Higbie made on his radio show about black Americans, Muslims, women, LGBT people, veterans suffering from PTSD and immigrants.","After the story published, Higbie resigned from his post as chief of external affairs at the Corporation for National and Community Service and apologized, saying on Twitter, \"I'm sorry. I'm not sorry that my words were published, I am sorry that I said them in 2013,\" he wrote. \"Those words do not reflect who I am or what I stand for, I regret saying them. Last night I informed the WH that I was resigning so as not to distract from POTUS' many success.\"","Higbie also shared content on Facebook that mirrored the racist sentiment he shared on the radio.","In October 2014, he shared a news article about an African man who raped his wife, and then circumcised her. Alongside the article, Higbie suggested that the Ebola virus was \"nature's way of controlling this population.\"","In another post in 2014, Higbie shared a link with an image of a black woman that said, \"See Obama Voter Can't Afford Water But Has Money For Manicures, Weaves and Tattos [sic]\". The link led to a video of a woman criticizing a store for charging for water, but the image was an unrelated Associated Press photo of a woman in Detroit who had her water shut off.","In September 2015, he shared an image of two black women standing on the American flag along with a caption that said, \"Cancel the welfare checks of anyone who disrespects the US flag.\"","Jason Miller, a former senior communications adviser for the Trump campaign, told CNN Friday night that he was upset by the language Higbie reportedly used.","\"I'm both disturbed and very concerned that someone who said these comments, these hateful type comments, was then hired by the C4,\" he said on CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\" \"This is not how the President talks, this is not how anyone near the President talks and this is exactly the story that the left wants to go and paint of the President and his supporters.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

But Cambridge Analytica shouldn’t act as a diversion from the real bad guy in this story: Facebook. It is mystifying that as his company regulates the flow of information to billions of human beings, encouraging certain purchasing habits and opinions, and monitoring people’s interactions, Mark Zuckerberg is invited to give lectures at Harvard without being treated with due scepticism.","We have now reached the point where an unaccountable private corporation is holding detailed data on over a quarter of the world’s population. Zuckerberg and his company have been avoiding responsibility for some time. Governments everywhere need to get serious in how they deal with Facebook.","After trolls were sent to jail for sending threatening messages to the activist Caroline Criado-Perez and MP Stella Creasy, a debate ensued over whether the likes of Facebook and Twitter should be classified as platforms or publishers. Facebook is treated as if it is simply a conduit for information, meaning it is not liable for the content its users share – in the same way that BT can’t be sued when people make threatening phone calls.","In 2014 Iain MacKenzie, a spokesperson for Facebook, said, “Every piece of content on Facebook has an associated ‘report’ option that escalates it to your user operations team for review. Additionally, individuals can block anyone who is harassing them, ensuring they will be unable to interact further. Facebook tackles malicious behaviour through a combination of social mechanisms and technological solutions appropriate for a mass-scale online opportunity.”","But the company is evasive about the number of moderators it employs, how they work, and how decisions are made. It has started taking a firmer line on far-right content – recently removing Britain First pages from the site – but it is still resisting many legislative attempts to regulate its content. What content users then see is decided by an algorithm that can change without any consultation, including with the government or the businesses that rely on Facebook for revenue – meaning that some can be quickly wiped off the map. In February 2018 the website Digiday reported on LittleThings, a four-year-old site that shut down overnight after Facebook decided to prioritise user posts over publisher content. A hundred jobs were lost.","Facebook wasn’t the only contributor to LittleThings’ demise, but those working at the website said there was nowhere else to go after the algorithm change. And this isn’t the only example: in 2013 an algorithm change halved the traffic of viral content website Upworthy – something from which the website has never recovered.","The impact of Facebook’s dominance means that publications are constantly scrambling to keep up with the platform’s changing strategy. The editor-in-chief of Wired, Nick Thompson, recently told the Digiday podcast that there was a fear “Facebook has a dial somewhere that can be turned to cut off media that gets too uppity”.","Much has been made of the fact that Facebook creates “filter bubbles”. It has been criticised for prioritising content that users will like – meaning there is less diversity in the news stories people read – and for failing to crack down on propaganda. In fact, Italy’s new far-right star Matteo Salvini explicitly thanked Facebook for contributing to the country’s recent election results.","All this from a company that in 2016 paid just £5.1m in corporation tax on its UK operations, despite profit and revenues nearly quadrupling on the back of increased advertising sales. In December 2017, Facebook announced it would start booking advertising revenue in countries where it was earned, instead of rerouting it via Ireland, although – as this newspaper reported – the move is “unlikely to result in it paying much more tax”. This is despite Zuckerberg calling for governments to start paying a universal basic income for every citizen as a response to automation, driven in part by Silicon Valley.","Even if we want to avoid the site and keep our data protected, it’s not as easy as one might think. According to Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook, the company uses techniques found in propaganda and casino gambling to foster psychological addiction in its users – such as constant notifications and variable rewards. By keeping us hooked, Facebook is able to hold a huge amount of data on us. What is surprising, and worrying, is the derived data Facebook has – the profiles it can build of its users based on seemingly innocuous information. The author of the book Networks of Control, Wolfie Christl, noted that a patent published by Facebook works out people’s commute times by using location data from mobile apps. It then uses this and other data to segregate users into social classes.","Facebook’s massive data cache goes hand in hand with its acquisition of competitors. Nick Srnicek, author of Platform Capitalism, says, “Facebook is acting like a classic monopoly: it’s buying up competitors like Instagram, it’s blatantly copying rivals like Snapchat, and it even has its own app, Onavo, that acts to warn them of potential threats. All of this is combined with an unchecked sweeping up of our data that’s being used to build an impervious moat around its business.”","If ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence. So perhaps it’s time to start treating Facebook as the giant multinational corporation it is – especially because people with Facebook profiles aren’t the company’s customers: they are the product it sells to advertisers."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

{"originalurl":"https://sites.google.com/view/turnofftrumpturnondemocracy","title":"Turn Off Trump.  Turn On Democracy.","text":["As you probably know, Donald Trump is the most unpopular President in the history of the U.S. His approval rate has dropped below 37%. 49% of the people in this country disapprove of him. This disapproval of Trump is growing fast and his support is shrinking.","Of course, part of the problem for Donald is the fact that the people of this country did not actually choose him to be their President. The popular vote went for Hillary Clinton, but the Electoral College gave the presidency to Trump. But, that is only where the problem begins. Trump has made his situation worse by neglecting, disappointing, or offending a different segment of our society each day he has been in office.","The United States is not the only country in the world where the people are given leaders they did not choose and told they must accept them. In the 2013 Iranian election, for example, the people voted for a liberal who promised change, but the Guardian Counsel gave them a conservative (an Islamic Fundamentalist). The people of Iran protested each night by lighting candles on their rooftops and making noise. It was a beautiful sight and a wonderful sound. In the end, they were not able to change their government, but they at least made sure that everyone in the world knew that the people of Iran did not approve of their government. Because the opposition was persistent, the government of Iran has recently started to make some reforms. It looks hopeful. The people of Iran inspire me.","In 2016, the people of South Korea became aware that their President was a corrupt puppet of a shadow organization. I had the good fortune to be there during the protests that ousted this President. The Korean people took to the streets with candles (or LED lights) every Saturday night. At first, the protests were small, but they grew bigger every Saturday. Eventually, they were so large that they filled the streets like rivers of light. At one point, the riot police charged with keeping the demonstrators away from the presidential palace started taking off their gear and joining the demonstrators. The demonstrations succeeded, the unpopular president was removed, and it was an inspiration to me.","Last year was the biggest year for protests in the history of the United States. Protesters outnumbered supporters for the Trump Inauguration in D.C. In some places, rioting broke out. The day after the Inauguration, the U.S. saw its largest protest ever, the Women's March in D.C. Americans also joined large demonstrations in every major city on that day. Later last year, we saw entire NFL teams taking a knee to protest during games. It didn't need to be about Trump, but he would not have it any other way. Over the past year, this disapproval of Donald Trump and what he stands for has not diminished; it has grown, and that has largely been due to his help. He has continued to regularly shock, anger, threaten, and alienate a growing number of people, including his own supporters. Every day, more people decide they want Trump out.","People like myself hope that future elections or FBI investigations will get rid of Trump, but we should not be naive. The past few elections have shown us how incredibly vulnerable our system is to manipulation. We also know that the FBI is part of the Executive Branch and can be purged by President Trump as long as Congress allows. We know that the Federal courts are being stacked with people chosen, not for their qualifications, but for their loyalty to Trump. The future of our democracy is in our hands.","Marches, boycotts, strikes, and other such protest actions might seem fruitless and even silly at times, but we need this type of action, if not to support the resistance within our government, then to at least boost our own morale and maintain our resolve. But, over the past year our actions have been weaker than they could have been due to our lack of creativity, unity, and inclusivity. Many of us joined in the Women's March on January 21st, 2017. Fewer of us joined the General Strikes later on. Even fewer of us joined the countless minor rallies and protests that continued to take place throughout the year for various specific issues. If not for Trump's own tendency to create opposition to his regime and then inflame it, the resistance might have mostly withered away a long time ago.","For this reason, I am begging all the common people like myself who disapprove of Trump to participate in a more unified and general collective action simply to popular disapproval of Donald Trump. People within the government and media need more support for their efforts to investigate his misdeeds. Activists and opposition parties need more support for their efforts to resist his policies and oust him from power.","I am also begging the numerous groups that disapprove of Trump based on one specific issue or another to support one another's actions better. When one group protests, the other groups must officially encourage their members to show up. When one group organizes a general strike, all the organizations must make this collective action their own to help it be more effective. There need to be unified collective actions promoted by every group under the general umbrella of disapproval. Anyone who disapproves of Donald Trump for whatever reason should be encouraged to, and be able to, participate in the collective actions.","Moreover, the various groups that disapprove of Donald Trump need to organize collective actions that are more inclusive of all Americans. People should be able to participate without taking a day off work. People should be able to join the action without driving hundreds of miles and spending thousands of dollars. People should be able to contribute meaningfully without having to make monetary donations. The collective actions have to be creative, fun, and energizing, yet remain simple, persistent, and inclusive in order to grow larger each time they occur.","I have an idea for one such action. If you like my idea, then please share it with as many people as possible and encourage any individual or group who disapproves of Donald Trump to join in. The idea is that people show disapproval of Donald Trump simply by turning everything off and making everything dark and quiet for ten minutes, then turning everything back on and making as much noise and light as possible. This action can be taken once a month at set times and dates. I'm trying to spread this idea for the next one of these actions to take place on Thursday, March 15th, the Ides of March. I will turn off the power to my house at exactly 9:00 PM EST. I will use the satellite time on my phone to get the exact time. Then, at exactly 9:10 PM EST, I will turn the power back on, honk my car horns, and shine bright lights up to the sky. I have actually purchased some bright spotlights to use at 9:10. If my neighbors ask me what I am doing, I will tell them. If I am driving, I will park somewhere safe for ten minutes with my lights off, then honk my horn long and loud and start driving again with my lights on. If I am outside somewhere, I will turn off or cover whatever lights are near me for ten minutes, then take out a flashlight and shine it up to the sky at 9:10.","The first time any of us do this, we might feel a little lonely or even embarrassed. This collective action might be small at first with very few people participating. That's how it feels at the start of a movement. That's how people felt in South Korea and Iran when they first started resisting and hadn't built up numbers yet. But, if we are persistent and encourage others who disapprove of Donald Trump for whatever reason to join us, then this collective action could grow much larger each time.","Certain regions or segments of our country solidly disapprove of Trump. Imagine if they all joined this one collective action. In certain neighborhoods and college campuses across the U.S. the overwhelming majority of people disapprove of Donald Trump. Trump's disapproval rating among African Americans is now 75%. Imagine if 75% of the people in a densely populated African American neighborhood turned off their lights at 9 PM, then turned them back on again exactly ten minutes later. There are many U.S. cities were Trump's disapproval rating is very high. In D.C. only 3% of the residents approve of Donald Trump. Imagine if they all turned off their lights at 9 PM and then turned them back on at 9:10. There are entire states and U.S. territories were the vast majority disapprove of Trump. Imagine if the people of Puerto Rico, California, or New York joined this collective action. Imagine if all of the labor unions, student organizations, and immigrant or religious minorities that disapprove of Trump joined this action.","If every person who disapproves of Donald Trump participated in this action... that's 49% of all Americans... about 150 million people... then the entire nation when viewed from space would dim for about ten minutes then light up. It would be the first protest visible from space and the largest collective action in the history if the world.","If you want to see this happen, then you must make it happen. Share this idea with as many people as you can.","This site is dedicated to spreading and idea about a new way people can show they disapprove of Donald Trump. I am a regular, working-class individual without affiliation to or funding from any other political group.I am not seeking any political position. In fact, I'd prefer that this idea got around without people even knowing who first promoted it.","Made with the new Google Sites, an effortless way to create beautiful sites."],"isopubdate":""}

New reporting on Cambridge Analytica has spurred massive public outcry from users and politicians, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling it a \"breach of trust.\"","These two cases, which were filed on March 20, could be just the first among what could be a coming wave of similar lawsuits.","One suit, filed by Lauren Price, of Maryland, says that she was served political ads during the 2016 presidential campaign and believes that she is part of the 50 million affected users.

But according to President-elect Donald Trump's digital director Brad Parscale, the social media giant was massively influential—not because it was tipping the scales with fake news, but because it helped generate the bulk of the campaign's $250 million in online fundraising.","\"Our biggest incubator that allowed us to generate that money was Facebook,\" says Parscale, who has been working for the campaign since before Trump officially announced his candidacy a year and a half ago. Over the course of the election cycle, Trump's campaign funneled $90 million to Parscale's San Antonio-based firm, most of which went toward digital advertising. And Parscale says more of that ad money went to Facebook than to any other platform.","'Facebook and Twitter were the reason we won this thing.'","Brad Parscale","\"Facebook and Twitter were the reason we won this thing,\" he says. \"Twitter for Mr. Trump. And Facebook for fundraising.\"","In the wake of Trump's stunning upset last week, media analysts have worked feverishly to figure out how social media may have altered the outcome of this election. They—and we—have pointed to online echo chambers and the proliferation of fake news as the building blocks of Trump's victory. But the answer may be much simpler. Of course Facebook was hugely influential in the presidential election, in large part because Trump's campaign embraced Facebook as a key advertising channel in a way that no presidential campaign has before—not even Clinton's.","\"I think the Trump campaign did that extremely well,\" says Andrew Bleeker, president of Bully Pulpit Interactive, which helped lead Hillary Clinton's digital marketing efforts. \"They spent a higher percentage of their spending on digital than we did.\"","Changing Minds Where It Mattered","Throughout the last year-and-a-half, stories about the imbalance between Clinton's ad spending compared to Trump's proliferated. They noted how Clinton spent more than $200 million on television ads in the final months of the election while Trump spent less than half that. Because Trump wasn’t spending as much on television all along, it seemed like his team wasn't investing in changing anyone’s minds. But they were: they were just doing it online.","\"The big takeaway was using digital in a digital-first way,\" says Matt Lira, a Republican digital strategist and senior advisor to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. \"It was the main course. It wasn't leftovers.\"","Facebook proved to be a powerful way for Trump's team to hone the campaign's message with the kind of enormous sample sizes you can't get with traditional polling. \"They have an advantage of a platform that has users that are conditioned to click and engage and give you feedback,\" says Gary Coby, director of advertising at the Republican National Committee, who worked on Trump's campaign. \"Their platform’s built to inform you about what people like and dislike.\"","Coby's team took full advantage of the ability to perform massive tests with its ads. On any given day, Coby says, the campaign was running 40,000 to 50,000 variants of its ads, testing how they performed in different formats, with subtitles and without, and static versus video, among other small differences. On the day of the third presidential debate in October, the team ran 175,000 variations. Coby calls this approach \"A/B testing on steroids.\" The more variations the team was able to produce, Coby says, the higher the likelihood that its ads would actually be served to Facebook users.","\"Every ad network and platform wants to serve the ad that's going to get the most engagement,\" Coby says. \"The more you're testing, the more opportunity you have to find the best setup.\"","The Digital Bully Pulpit","Clinton also had a robust digital strategy, investing $30 million in digital ads in the homestretch. Her campaign produced thousands of rapid-response videos and set up a customer service team to help people with their voting questions. But, says Bleeker, \"the Trump campaign took to an extreme what we were trying to do on the Hillary campaign.\"","The President-elect has shown he can turn a news cycle in 140 characters or less.","Social media was Trump's primary communication channel. It wasn't a platform for broadcasting pre-planned messages but for interacting with supporters and starting new conversations—however controversial those conversations often were. Bleeker says one of the biggest lessons he's learned from this election cycle is that social media is increasingly going to be part of any candidate's so-called \"earned media strategy\"—that is, the coverage a candidate gets for free in the press. The President-elect has shown he can turn a news cycle in 140 characters or less; in a recent 60 Minutes interview, he said he plans to continue using Twitter as president.","\"He’s going to tell his side of the story from the digital bully pulpit,\" Lira says.","Whether fake news did or didn't affect the election's outcome, Facebook as a platform did. The winning candidate was not just willing, but eager to break with traditional models of campaigning. His team invested in new ways of using the digital tools and platforms that have come to dominate the media landscape.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

You see, right before iOS 6 and its Facebook contact sync feature came out, Facebook forcibly hid the real email addresses everyone shared with their friends. It only left the @facebook.com addresses it assigned everyone visible, so that’s what got synced by iOS 6.","At the time in June 2012 I called this “poppycock” and implored Facebook to undo the visibility change it made without permission. Allowing users to choose to share their @facebook.com address that routed to their Facebook Messages Inbox would have been fine. If Facebook wanted to compete to be your email address, though, it should have done it on a level playing field.","And it bombed. No one used the @facebook.com email addresses. Facebook thought it should be where you read personal emails. It created an integrated communication system designed to combine instant chat, asynchronous messages, and email. Turns out that last part was just too different to be corralled.","So today the company began digging a grave for @facebook.com email addresses. In a statement to TechCrunch, the company said: “We’re making this change because most people haven’t been using their Facebook email address, and we can focus on improving our mobile messaging experience for everyone.” Anyone who did use them will get messages sent to their Facebook addresses forwarded to their primary email account instead of their Facebook Messages inbox.","People will be able to dig into their settings and disable this forwarding. But if you don’t, anyone will be able to get your Facebook username by finding your profile’s URL and sticking it in front of @facebook.com to be able to hit your real email address with a message. Facebook confirms it won’t forward blatant spam, but pings from strangers that would have been hidden in the “Other Inbox” of your Facebook Messages will get shot to your real email like that person knows you. Ugh.","Yet we still won’t be able to escape the death-stench of Facebook’s defunct attempt to conquer email. Facebook tells me it won’t be changing any visibility settings in your profile or re-syncing with iOS contacts. That means your real personal email address is probably still hidden from the friends you once explicitly said could see it. And your iOS contact book will be full of synced Facebook profiles and @facebook.com addresses that people might disavow, instead of their real email addresses.","Hopefully this whole crap carnival will discourage Facebook from making more prohibited changes to our profiles…or those of users of its acquisitions like WhatsApp. Facebook was just trying to make it so our personal emails weren’t drowned out by bills, receipts, and marketing spam. But it crossed the line, abused its power, and our contact books bear the scar."],"isopubdate":"2014-02-24"}

Back when I joined Facebook in 2006, it still showed status updates like “Biz is ....” My first status update was apparently to tell people I was just “at home” followed by a smiley two hours later.","When you download your data, you get a copy of every photo and video you've uploaded to Facebook. If you open the photos webpage, you can see all the meta data Facebook stores with each one. It keeps track of when you took the photo, where you took the photo, and your IP address when you uploaded it.","(Business Insider)","Facebook even has my “Facial Recognition Data” on file. The three thresholds mean nothing to me, but apparently Facebook has 237 examples of what I look like on file.","I can already easily tell who all my friends are on Facebook, but the company also keeps track of the friends I've removed over the last 10 years. Unfortunately, I can't tell who removed me from their friends list. The other odd designation? Facebook keeps track of what it calls your “friend peer group” — mine is classified (accurately) as \"Starting Adult Life\".","The next stage for Facebook?","And in case you need a look back on your social calendar, Facebook keeps a record of all the events you've attended. Not a bad idea if you need to look up an old address or date (or be reminded of your high-school prom).","It also has a copy of all of your Facebook messages — although it's much easier to access those through your normal Facebook account than through the data download.","Under ads, Facebook tracks what it thinks you're interested in AND the ads you've clicked on. It only holds ad info on what you've clicked on for a short time, so it's not your total history. As for its ad topics, I have no idea how it came up with half of these interests (Monarchy of the United Kingdom?? Crust Geology??), nor does the data tell me.","Remember Pokes?

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.","GRAVE VIOLATION","\"If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook's policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,\" Facebook said.","Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","On Tuesday people were seen carrying multiple plastic storage containers into and out of the building that houses Cambridge Analytica's London office, among other companies.

Your data and that of your friends could have been harvested and sold to political groups. A new investigation reveals 50 million Facebook profiles were harvested by the data analytics team who worked with Trump and Brexit - and then used to target political campaigns and predict their voting behaviour. A whistleblower from data analysis company Cambridge Analytica says the company used personal information taken without authorisation in 2014 to help build a system predicting voters' preferences. Christopher Wylie, who previously worked with a Cambridge University academic to get the data, told the Observer: “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.” The data was harvested from both users and their friends who used \"thisisyourdigitallife\", a quiz app which claimed to be a psychology tool.","Green Party Hands Question Time to NationalThe Green Party have handed over most of their primary questions to the opposition during question time in parliament. The deal gives the National party an additional 42 questions this year. Greens co-leader James Shaw says the deal with National was to limit the number of \"patsy\" questions from their own MPs and support parties, and allow the opposition to hold the government to account. The National party was putting emphasis on environmental policy and the Greens were happy to co-operate on those issues, he said. National party leader Simon Bridges says he appreciates the move but it should not be looked into as a partnership with the Green party.","Struggle to Increase Number of Early Childhood TeachersSector leaders have told the government that they will have trouble meeting its goals of increasing the number of qualified early childhood teachers in New Zealand. The Labour government's election policy was to increase the number of qualified staff in early childhood centres from 50 percent to 80 percent. However, many early childhood centres across New Zealand are struggling to meet the current 50 percent requirement. Chief Executive of Te Rito Maioha Early Childhood New Zealand says teachers need better pay, as childhood teachers are paid much lower than primary and secondary teachers with the same qualifications.","National Party Signs Unsuspecting Petitioners Up to Mailing ListThe National Party has had to apologise after signing up potentially thousands of people to their mailing list.

Auckland Council Investment stated ‘commercial interests’ of the ports as a reason for the report to be withheld. The report was finally released three days before the Christmas break. Auckland Mayor Phil Goff criticised the report’s approach and disagrees with the findings, believing that the cost and losses from moving the car trade would outweigh the benefit of $1 billion dollars.","INTERNATIONAL","Turkish Forces Seize Syrian City, Taking Down Kurdish StatueTurkish backed armed forces have taken over the Syrian Kurdish city of Afrin, taking down a statue of a Kurdish figure and raising new flags in the city centre.

The firms’ employees, who often overlap, had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil, the Russian oil giant.","Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey. SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature, and SCL also said there were no meetings in London.","The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican clients in the United States — and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters’ behavior.","Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014. It is not clear what — or which client — prompted the line of questioning, which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr. Putin’s popularity to Russian expansionism.","On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times, SCL said it did business in Russia. In both documents, the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients, with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm’s elections division. In a statement, SCL said an employee had done “commercial work” about 25 years ago “for a private company in Russia.”","Image","President Vladimir V.

While Mr. Nix’s firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference, Democrats on the committee want a fuller review. “It is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica,” they said in a report this month.","Asked about the Russian oil company, a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm’s commercial division “discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty-card customers at gas stations.” The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired.","Arash Repac, chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol, offered a different explanation for the talks. He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.","“We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting,” he wrote in response to a question from The Times. “Even though our campaign went ahead, we decided not to cooperate with SCL. No contracts were signed.”","But Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company’s voter-profiling technology, said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters.","“I remember being super confused,” said Mr. Wylie, who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings.","“I kept asking Alexander, ‘Can you explain to me what they want?’” he said, referring to Mr. Nix. “I don’t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.”","“We’re sending them stuff about political targeting — they then come and ask more about political targeting,” Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil “just didn’t seem to be interested” in how the techniques could be used commercially.","Mr. Wylie, a former contractor, left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company. He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business. SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company.","A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr. Wylie’s account, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement.","Though Lukoil is not state-owned, it depends on Kremlin support, and its chief executive, Vagit Alekperov, has met with Mr. Putin on a number of occasions.

Instead, it helped create one.","The company knew ahead of time that on Saturday, the New York Times and The Guardian’s Observer would issue bombshell reports that the data firm that helped Donald Trump win the presidency had accessed and retained information on 50 million Facebook users without their permission.","Facebook did two things to protect itself: it sent letters to the media firms laying out its legal case for why this data leak didn’t constitute a “breach.” And then it scooped the reports using their information, with a Friday blog post on why it was suspending the ad firm, Cambridge Analytica, from its site.","Both moves backfired.","On Friday, Facebook said it “received reports” that Cambridge Analytica hadn’t deleted the user data, and that it needed to suspend the firm. The statement gave the impression that Facebook had looked into the matter. In fact, the company’s decisions were stemming from information in the news reports set to publish the next day, and it had not independently verified those reports, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. By trying to look proactive, Facebook ended up adding weight to the news.","On Saturday, any good will the company earned by talking about the problem first was quickly undone when reporters revealed Facebook’s behind-the-scenes legal maneuvering. “Yesterday Facebook threatened to sue us. Today we publish this,” Carole Cadwalladr, the Observer reporter, wrote as she linked her story to Twitter, in a post shared almost 15,000 times. The Guardian said it had nothing to add to her statement. The Times confirmed that it too received a letter, but said it didn’t consider the correspondence a legal threat.","Front-running the stories along with the letters to newsrooms are but two of several ways Facebook failed to contain fallout from the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Silence on the part of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg didn’t help. Nor did a report late Monday in the New York Times that Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos is leaving after clashing with other executives, including Sandberg, over how Facebook handled Russian disinformation campaigns. Facebook said Stamos is still at the company, but didn’t outright deny that he plans to leave.","“Most of its executives haven’t done a real interview in ages, let alone answer deep questions,” Zeynep Tufecki, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who specializes in social networks and democracy, wrote in a post on Twitter.","In a sign of investor dismay, Facebook shares tumbled 6.8 percent on Monday, the biggest decline since March 2014. As the stock fell and criticism from lawmakers poured in from the U.S. and Britain, the company worked to make it clear that it didn’t actually have enough information, on its own, to react to Saturday’s news reports in a stronger way.","Facebook put out another blog post, saying that Cambridge Analytica and the researcher who provided them the data, Aleksandr Kogan, had agreed to a digital forensics audit to prove they deleted it. Facebook said the one person who didn’t agree to the audit was Christopher Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica contractor who spoke to the newspapers about the data leak. With the post, Facebook aimed to stir more skepticism around Wylie’s information, according to a person familiar with the matter.","That didn’t resolve things quickly either. The auditors were already on site at Cambridge Analytica’s London office Monday when they had to pause their work. The U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation.","The Cambridge Analytica saga is the latest in a series of bungled Facebook responses, often reactionary and sometimes unintentionally stirring public outrage instead of resolving concerns. The company’s interaction with the public tends to start with a carefully crafted blog post, and then evolve into a much more improvised Twitter-based conversation with lower-level executives who defend the social network and explain its decisions. It doesn’t always go well.","Earlier this year, when the U.S. government indicted 13 Russians who used Facebook to manipulate voters, a Facebook advertising executive took to Twitter to clarify that overall, the Russian ads were primarily used to divide Americans, not influence the election. His comments went viral after President Donald Trump used them to back up attacks on the “fake news media.”","In 2017, Facebook made its disclosures on Russia’s activities in a slow drip, each time illustrating a bigger problem. An April white paper on “information operations,” for example, didn’t name the country. The company that October said 10 million users saw Russia’s ads. Later that month, Facebook said 126 million people saw Russia’s posts in general. The company upped the number to 150 million during Congressional interrogation, when a senator asked if Facebook could include Instagram, the photo-sharing app it owns, in the count.","Stamos, who has favored more forthright disclosure, was frequently outvoted, according to the New York Times. He’s planning to leave the company in August, the newspaper reported. On Twitter, he later said he’s still fully engaged with his work at Facebook, without answering questions about his plans. But that would make him the most high-profile exit since Facebook’s election-related troubles began.","Meanwhile, higher ranking executives remain quiet. Zuckerberg and Sandberg, who in past years would post frequently about the issues of the day, have shied away from reacting to the most controversial news. Lawmakers have now called out Zuckerberg by name in both the U.S. and the U.K.","Zuckerberg and Sandberg plan to remain quiet on the Cambridge Analytica situation until the company completes its internal review of what happened, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Facebook can continue to deliver their service to you and send you advertising. The difference is that it will be much harder for Facebook to use your activity collected off Facebook to send you ads and other targeted messages [emphasis added].\"","Mozilla introduced the container concept to mainstream Firefox users in September when it rolled out \"Firefox Multi-Account Containers,\" a company-made add-on. In a way somewhat similar to how Firefox - and other browsers - isolate one tab from others to block app- or system-wide exploits, these containers insulate cookies generated by one site from those produced by other websites. (Normally, all cookies are stored in one memory location by the browser; Mozilla's extension sets up multiple \"cookie jars,\" or storage locations, and thus prevents one site from recognizing and reading cookies recorded by other URLs.)","\"If used carefully, Containers can prevent tracking. If a site is only opened in one Container, cookies set on that container cannot follow the user to other sites visited in non-container tabs or other containers,\" Mozilla stated in a backgrounder about the technology.","Facebook Container is, at root, a customized version of the earlier add-on, as Mozilla explained in another, albeit unsigned, blog post Tuesday.","\"When you install this extension, it will delete your Facebook cookies and log you out of Facebook,\" the company noted. \"The next time you visit Facebook it will open in a new blue-colored browser tab (aka 'container tab').

The ads, which ran between June 2015 and May 2017, were linked to some 470 fake accounts and pages the company said it had shut down.","Facebook officials said the fake accounts were created by a Russian company called the Internet Research Agency, which is known for using “troll” accounts to post on social media and comment on news websites.","The disclosure adds to the evidence of the broad scope of the Russian influence campaign, which American intelligence agencies concluded was designed to damage Hillary Clinton and boost Donald J. Trump during the election. Multiple investigations of the Russian meddling, and the possibility that the Trump campaign somehow colluded with Russia, have cast a shadow over the first eight months of Mr. Trump’s presidency.","Facebook staff members on Wednesday briefed the Senate and House intelligence committees, which are investigating the Russian intervention in the American election. Mr. Stamos indicated that Facebook is also cooperating with investigators for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, writing that “we have shared our findings with U.S. authorities investigating these issues, and we will continue to work with them as necessary.”","Mr. Stamos wrote that while some of the ads specifically mentioned the two candidates, most focused instead on issues that were polarizing the electorate: “divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum — touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.”","Facebook did not make public any of the ads, nor did it say how many people saw them. But Mr. Trump regularly offered outspoken comments on those issues during the campaign, denouncing “political correctness” and rallying his supporters on the right.","Image","Robert Mueller, the special counsel, is leading one of a number of investigations into Russia’s role in last year’s presidential election.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times","In its review of election-related advertising, Facebook said it had also found an additional 2,200 ads, costing $50,000, that had less certain indications of a Russian connection. Some of those ads, for instance, were purchased by Facebook accounts with internet protocol addresses that appeared to be in the United States but with the language set to Russian.","In a January report, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency concluded that the Russian government, on direct orders from President Vladimir V. Putin, was responsible for hacking Democratic targets and leaking thousands of emails and other documents in an attempt to hurt Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and mar her reputation.","The report also found that hundreds of Russian “trolls,” or paid social media users, had posted anti-Clinton messages. But it did not name Facebook or address the question of advertising.","The January intelligence report said the “likely financier” of the Internet Research Agency was “a close Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence.” The company, profiled by The New York Times Magazine in 2015, is in St. Petersburg and uses its small army of trolls to put out messages supportive of Russian government policy.","The revelations can only add to the political skirmishing in Washington over Russia’s role in the election. Mr. Trump has often dismissed the Russian hacking story as “fake news” and bristled at any implication that Mr. Putin had helped him win. To date, while news reports have uncovered many meetings and contacts between Trump associates and Russians, there has been no evidence proving collusion in the hacking or other Russian activities.","Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a telephone interview that the Facebook disclosure “certainly quantifies the Russian use of at least one social media platform with a level of granularity that we did not have before.” He said the committee has been in touch with Facebook for some time, adding, “I don’t think this is the last word on the matter by Facebook or in terms of our investigation on the social media issue.”","Mr. Schiff said he has more questions for Facebook, including when the company first become aware of the problem, what warning signs it found, how sophisticated the Russian operation was and what steps Facebook was taking to guard against such activity in the future.","“Clearly Facebook doesn’t want to become the arbiter of what’s true and what’s not true,” Mr. Schiff said. “But they do have a civil responsibility to do the best they can to inform their users of when they’re being manipulated by a foreign actor.”","The suspicion that Russia had a hand in placing Facebook ads was first mentioned in a Time magazine article in May, but Wednesday’s announcement was the company’s first acknowledgment of the problem.","Facebook, which offers a sophisticated level of targeting to advertisers, has been in the center of a storm over the role that it played in propagating false news reports and other misleading information during the campaign. The company acknowledged in April that fake accounts were a problem and said it accepted the intelligence agencies’ findings on the matter, but it avoided naming Russia.","Mr. Stamos’s post on Wednesday was more forthright, saying that the fake Facebook accounts connected to the ads “likely operated out of Russia.”","After initially denying that fake news on the service had any influence on the election, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has gradually come around to the notion that the company must do more. Facebook has implemented a series of steps to combat fake content, including recruiting outside reviewers to check out and flag dubious articles.","But the new measures do not directly affect Facebook ads. Advertisers pay to have particular Facebook posts displayed high in the news feeds of whatever group of people is targeted.","The audience for an ad can be chosen using broad factors, such as middle-aged American men, or very specific ones, such as mothers who live in Minneapolis and like churches and the Minnesota Twins.","That ability to target is valuable to political campaigns, and the company actively reaches out to candidates around the world to teach them how to use Facebook to get their messages out, including through paid advertising.","One question underlying the investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia is whether Russia-sponsored operators would have needed any guidance from American political experts. Facebook said that some of the ads linked to Russian accounts had targeted particular geographic areas, which may raise questions about whether anyone had helped direct such targeting.","Under federal law, foreign governments, companies and citizens are prohibited from spending money to influence American elections. Facebook’s disclosure could add an additional element to the possible crimes under investigation by Mr. Mueller.","Correction:","A picture initially paired with this article was posted in error. The three unidentified people shown looking at their cell phones were not connected to the issue of ads on Facebook purchased through fake Russian accounts.","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Fake Russian Facebook Accounts Planted $100,000 in Political Ads.

This has been acknowledged by the Privacy Commissioner himself – who is pushing for powers to impose much larger fines.","The bill makes some important changes – for example:","strengthening protections around cross-border data flows and clarifying the application of the law to overseas providers;","All these things are going to be important for New Zealand organisations needing to comply with GDPR, and for New Zealand to maintain its “adequate country” status – allowing data to be transferred here by organisations in the EU without the need for special measures.","It’s also fair to say the proposed new regime is – rightly or wrongly – less prescriptive and detailed than GDPR and other international equivalents.","So, what should you be doing?","If your business captures and uses data, and particularly if you rely on the data as part of your business model, it’s important to understand these developments. The concept of “privacy by design” – an approach to projects that promotes data privacy and compliance from the start – is enshrined in the GDPR and will be the minimum standard expected not just by regulators, but by customers. To succeed in this environment means:","assessing the way you (and other organisations you rely on) currently capture and use data","building data privacy into the design of your products and services","looking at your legal terms – with both your customers and your providers – to ensure they comply with law while appropriately protecting your interests (and those of your customers)","reviewing the new Privacy Bill and participating in the parliamentary process to ensure your interests are taken into account.","In addition to all that, does your business need to go further? We are approaching an era where individuals will demand control over their own data, and if they don’t like how you’re treating it, will stop engaging with your business. In this environment, our view is that any approach to collection and use of data should be built in a way that recognises the value of the data, respects the individual who is the source of it, and gives them the control they are looking for over their own data. This is the essence of privacy by design.","There are some complex and intricate balances to be struck to ensure you maximise the opportunities and minimise the threats presented by use of data.","Those who are engaging now are in the best position to succeed.","{","Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has strongly opposed the legislation, listed several consequences of the bill, which it called “far-reaching” and “privacy-upending”:","Enable foreign police to collect and wiretap people’s communications from U.S. companies, without obtaining a U.S. warrant.","Allow foreign nations to demand personal data stored in the United States, without prior review by a judge.","Allow the U.S. president to enter “executive agreements” that empower police in foreign nations that have weaker privacy laws than the United States to seize data in the United States while ignoring U.S. privacy laws.","Allow foreign police to collect someone’s data without notifying them about it.","Empower U.S. police to grab any data, regardless if it’s a U.S. person’s or not, no matter where it is stored.","The bill is an update to the current MLAT (Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty), the current framework for sharing internet user data between countries, which both legislators and tech companies have criticized as inefficient.","Some tech companies, like Microsoft, have endorsed the new CLOUD policy. Brad Smith, the company’s president and chief legal officer, called it “a strong statute and a good compromise,” that “gives tech companies like Microsoft the ability to stand up for the privacy rights of our customers around the world.”","They echoed the sentiment of lawmakers like Orrin Hatch (R-UT). In February, he said of the bill:","“The CLOUD Act bridges the divide that sometimes exists between law enforcement and the tech sector by giving law enforcement the tools it needs to access data throughout the world while at the same time creating a commonsense framework to encourage international cooperation to resolve conflicts of law.”","But one of the biggest complaints from privacy advocates, however, it that the new legislation places too much unmitigated power in the hands of governments with abysmal human rights records while also giving too much discretion to the U.S. government’s executive branch. Noting that the executive branch will decide which countries are human rights compliant and that those countries will then be able to engage in data collection and wiretaps without any further restrictions or oversight, the ACLU warned:","“Flip through Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch’s recent annual reports, and you can find a dizzying array of countries that have ratified major human rights treaties and reflect those obligations in their domestic laws but, in fact, have arrested, tortured and killed people in retaliation for their activism or due to their identity.”","The organization pointed out that no human rights organizations have endorsed the CLOUD Act, adding that “in the case of countries certified by the executive branch, the CLOUD Act would not require the U.S. government to scrutinize data requests by the foreign governments — indeed, the bill would not even require notifying the U.S. government or a user regarding a request.”","Further, the ACLU says, if a foreign government’s human rights record deteriorates, there is no mechanism to revoke its access to data. Considering the U.S.’ existing record on supporting regimes that severely restrict basic rights like freedom of expression, the expanded access the CLOUD Act provides is undoubtedly worrisome.","Also predictable is the government’s stale justification for expanding its power. As the CLOUD Act claims, it is purportedly to “protect public safety and combat serious crime, including terrorism” — even if it further empowers governments that support and commit said terrorism.","In an age where the government already engages in mass surveillance and is eager to disable the people’s efforts to protect their privacy through encryption technology, it is unsurprising, albeit dangerous, that Congress continues to encroach on what little is left of safeguards against unwarranted intrusions."],"isopubdate":""}

What does the kind of pet you have say about your personality? Which US city is your perfect fit?","Quizzes like these are all over Facebook and other social networks. For kids, online personality tests are as compelling as the Hogwarts Sorting Hat: They define you at the precise moment when the most important thing is knowing who you are. And, whether you're a Slytherin or just shy, personality quizzes sort us into social groups where we feel safe knowing that there are others just like us.","But, as the Cambridge Analytica acquisition of millions of Facebook users' data reveals, online personality quizzes can be used as a tool of the dark arts of politics. While it's far from being a comprehensive solution, knowing how to avoid the risks of these super popular tests can help you and your kids tighten up your online privacy.","Imagine if all the data used by the Sorting Hat – every photo you loved, every opinion you agreed with, every famous person's quote you didn't like – could be bought, sold, and even stolen. If someone got their hands on that information, they'd know a lot about you. And they'd know a lot about your friends, too.","Online personality quizzes work their magic in much the same way. If you've ever downloaded a personality quiz through Facebook, you may be one of the thousands of people who unwittingly supplied information about yourself and your friends for use in highly targeted psychological profiles exploited in the 2016 presidential campaign.","And it's not only the quiz information these third-party apps collect. They plug into a social media host and collect information that's located in your Facebook profile, including your political and religious views. The friends you're connected with on social media may be sharing your information when they take quizzes, too, supplying the quiz creators with more profiles and more data points to sort into groups. The groups are valuable to anyone who wants to target ads to specific categories of people whose likes and dislikes match up. Whether it's a brand of shoes or campaign messages, a receptive audience can make it go viral.","Frankly, most of us don't spend much time thinking about online privacy until a breach occurs. Sure, we tell our kids not to tell online strangers where they live, but beyond basic safety precautions, we're pretty hands off. Targeted ads? Who cares. Endless email alerts? Whatever. But now we know one of the key methods bad actors use to get us to give them what they want: personality quizzes. They may be a small thing to give up, but they could also be the tip of the iceberg. And it's always a good idea to be mindful of new online marketing methods and refresh your privacy settings. Here are five ways to make your family's use of social media a little safer.","Be careful with quizzes. To be super safe, just say no to online personality tests or any seemingly innocent game that asks questions. All those clicks and taps give the company information on you. While not all online tests misuse your data, you usually have to go into the quiz's terms of service to find out which information they collect and how they use it.","Take a look at the information you're sharing. When you click on a quiz or any other plug-in or applet in your feed, you should see which information it's requesting from your profile, including who your friends are. Some apps let you edit this information on the spot. But even if you opt out of sharing certain information, you may still be giving up more than you intend.","Use privacy settings and review them frequently. All social media offers privacy settings – some more than others. The companies usually keep them off by default, so you have to go in and enable the ones you want. This is a good time to sit down with your kids and go over their privacy settings. Facebook, for example, offers many levels of privacy for each piece of information it stores. The safest setting to use is \"Only Me,\" which means you're the only one who can view it and Facebook is not allowed to share it. Also, check your app settings on Facebook to see what you've agreed to share with each app.","Use two-factor authentication. Most social media offers two-factor authentication, which allows you to authorise only certain devices to access an account. It increases your security because it prevents people from logging into your account even if they have your password.","Do a little housekeeping by deleting old accounts and updating your passwords. Hackers can get to you by going through your defunct social media profiles. To find old accounts, Google your name; you might be surprised at what you find. And if you can find it, anyone else can, too. Also, update your passwords. — Common Sense Media/Tribune News Service"],"isopubdate":""}
{"originalurl":"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/magazine/the-obama-campaigns-digital-masterminds-cash-in.html","title":"The Obama Campaign’s Digital Masterminds Cash In - The New York Times","text":["The Obama Campaign’s Digital Masterminds Cash In","Earlier this year, senior members of President Barack Obama’s campaign team took a trip to Las Vegas. Nevada holds a special place in Obama-wonk lore as the place where his monthslong strategy of defeating Hillary Clinton by slowly and surely amassing delegates emerged. But the operatives were not there in March for any political reason. They were there to make money — specifically to land what they hoped would be the first corporate client for their new advertising business, Analytics Media Group (A.M.G.). Its bland name obscures its relatively grand promise: to deliver to commercial advertisers some of the Obama campaign’s secret, technologically advanced formulas for reaching voters.","The potential client was Caesars. The casino chain was looking for ways to induce semiregular visitors to show up more routinely at its other casinos around the country and to keep regulars from defecting to new competitors. A.M.G. was making the pitch that keeping gamblers loyal to Caesars was not all that different from keeping onetime Obama voters from straying to Mitt Romney. It was all a matter of figuring out how to get their message in front of the right customers at the right time. It was not lost on the Obama strategists that the “change” they were talking about was not the kind “you can believe in” but rather the kind you can put in a slot machine. “I kind of felt like the Devil’s advocate,” Chauncey McLean, 31, the Democratic Party’s director of media tracking during the campaign and now A.M.G.’s chief operating officer, wryly told me.","A.M.G. was founded in late December by a splinter group of longtime Obama advisers: Larry Grisolano, who oversaw how the campaign spent its advertising dollars; Grisolano’s direct-mail partners Terry Walsh and Pete Giangreco; Jeff Link, a seasoned Iowa veteran who was an outside adviser in 2012; and Erik Smith, an advertising consultant for the 2012 campaign, whose work running one of the biggest 2004 pro-Kerry outside groups gave him an inside track with party donors from the corporate world.","McLean was their first hire. During the campaign he proved himself to be particularly deft at translating between the old hands of the political world, who talk about “message” and “narrative,” and the quants in their 20s, who speak of “code” and “algorithms.”","McLean was so moved by Obama’s 2004 convention speech — the one that called for an end to a red-state America and a blue-state America — that when Obama decided to run in 2008, he took a leave from law school and joined the campaign. He had just spent the last 18 months of the 2012 presidential race bouncing between a couch in Washington and a small, shared apartment in Chicago where a colleague slept in the dining room. So he was experiencing considerable culture shock in the high life of Vegas.","Arriving at Caesars Palace after a first-class flight (only the second of his life), he was shown to his room. “I open the door and there’s just this huge, like, double, wall-to-wall window with a view of the strip and a huge king bed,” he said. Over room service, he met with his deputy, Chris Frommann, now 26, and made some last-minute revisions to their proposal. McLean took an iPhone picture of his kung pao chicken and sent it to his wife back in Brooklyn, “to show her that I’d made it,” he joked.","The next morning McLean, Frommann, Grisolano, Smith and a couple of others were escorted through a maze of doors that led them to the casino’s marble-and-glass executive offices, where their meeting went well enough that they scheduled another, to discuss a deal. Later that night they celebrated with a red-meat-and-red-wine dinner at Old Homestead, Caesars’ upscale steakhouse.","Recalling that Vegas trip while sitting at a MacBook Pro-dotted coffee shop in Brooklyn in March, McLean treated his shift from selling Obama to selling Caesars as a small discomfort that was necessary if he wanted to keep working on the technological advancements he and his colleagues developed on the campaign. In a nonpresidential year, no political effort would have the money to finance what he described as the “huge R.& D. project” that the Obama campaign effectively became. The resources for that kind of project could now be found only in corporate America. If companies with big budgets wanted members of Obama’s team to do for them whatever it was that they did for the president, McLean couldn’t see why they shouldn’t answer the call.","Political marketing has usually lagged behind commercial marketing. Companies that spend billions of dollars a year developing ways to make many more billions of dollars a year tend to have little to learn from presidential campaigns, which are generally start-ups aimed at a one-day sale. But the (re)selling of the president, 2012, was an entirely different matter. The campaign recruited the best young minds in the booming fields of analytics and behavioral science and placed them in a room they called “the cave” for up to 16 hours a day over the course of roughly 16 months. After the election, when the technology wizards finally came out, they had not only helped produce a victory that defied a couple of historical predictors; they also developed a host of highly effective marketing techniques that were either entirely new or had never been tried on such a grand scale.","Grisolano and McLean and the others were part of a singular breakthrough in the field of television-ad buying, where about 50 percent of the campaign’s budget was spent, or more than $400 million. Previous campaigns would make decisions about how to direct their television-advertising budgets largely based on hunches and deductions about what channels the voters they wanted to reach were watching. Their choices were informed by the broad viewership ratings of Nielsen and other survey data, which typically led to buying relatively expensive ads during evening-news and prime-time viewing hours. The 2012 campaign took advantage of advanced set-top-box monitoring technology to figure out what shows the voters they wanted to reach were watching and when, resulting in a smarter and cheaper — if potentially more invasive — way to beam commercials into their homes. The system gave Obama a significant advantage over Mitt Romney, according to Democrats and many Republicans (at least those who were not on Romney’s media team). Now A.M.G.’s founders say the company is at the forefront of a move to turn upside down the way the $60-billion-a-year television-ad market has functioned since its start. And they hope to get very rich in the process.","That is essentially the pitch Grisolano began making just before Christmas to the tech whizzes he needed to hire to rebuild the system they used during the campaign. He also offered profit sharing and salaries often commensurate with those being offered by Facebook or Google, who were also recruiting from the Obama campaign.","“You’re sort of involved in this cutting edge of something and see this whole thing on the horizon changing,” Grisolano recounted telling them. “I think that’s exciting.”","McLean, for one, was primed to hear his message. When the election was won last fall, he asked Jim Messina, Obama’s innovative campaign manager — and ardent tech advocate — what he should do with his life. As McLean tells it, and Messina affirms, Messina said, “I’d either go out into the country and run a campaign or I’d go make a load of money.”","A couple of weeks before Election Day, over drinks at the Pump Room in Chicago’s Gold Coast, a safe distance away from the re-election headquarters and its press minders, Grisolano and Erik Smith first let on that there was far more happening in the Chicago campaign office than any of us covering it truly understood. Grisolano told me that the campaign literally knew every single wavering voter in the country that it needed to persuade to vote for Obama, by name, address, race, sex and income. What’s more, he hinted, the campaign had figured out how to get its television advertisements in front of them with a previously inconceivable level of knowledge and accuracy.","Grisolano, a gruff and stocky Iowan, spent years in the shadow of his mentor, Obama’s founding strategist, David Axelrod, happily so, but he now seemed eager for his own recognition. There was also no mistaking that he believed he had figured something out that would be worth a lot of money after the election. He wouldn’t say more, at least not then. But after the election, in February, he began to describe his new business venture to me in detail.","To understand how it works, you must first understand the vast technological engine that powered the campaign but remained largely out of view of the public and the press. Messina, the campaign manager, often boasted about how the Obama 2012 effort would be “the most data-driven campaign ever.” But what that truly meant — the extent to which the campaign used the newest tech tools to look into people’s lives and the sheer amount of personal data its vast servers were crunching — remained largely shrouded. The secrecy around the operation was partly because the president’s strategists wanted to maintain their competitive edge. But it was also no doubt because they worried that practices like “data mining” and “analytics” could make voters uncomfortable.","Using data wasn’t new for the Obama strategists. The 2008 campaign developed the most sophisticated system to date to identify tens of millions of voters and place them into useful categories: those most likely to vote Republican, who would be ignored; those supporting Obama — and how likely they were to vote. That system — based on a complicated scoring method that relied on the processing of reams of data — was first devised by an outside consultant, Ken Strasma. But it was partly managed inside the campaign by an economics forecaster, Dan Wagner, who, at 24, helped perfect it for the campaign’s use. Wagner, who was recruited by A.M.G. but decided to start his own venture instead, seems to exist in two realms. One is digital, where he operates like a Dungeons and Dragons dungeon master, trying to shape the rules to the reality he is creating (“I was a Level 14 wizard or something,” he jokes of the fantasy role-playing game). The other is corporeal, where he is self-deprecating about things like his romantic life. (“Hey, I do ‘Big Data,’ ” he says.) His work on the 2008 campaign has been portrayed in a book, “The Victory Lab,” by Sasha Issenberg. “Here’s where I am in the ‘Victory Lab’ — blah, blah, blah,” he said dryly while turning to his chapter in the copy I was carrying when we met for breakfast at the Ace Hotel in Manhattan one day in May.","Wagner dismisses the notion of “romantic war rooms” operating on political gut instinct as outdated and misguided. His is a hard-data system that rejects anything that is not definitively quantifiable. In the Bush era, strategists boasted about how they could predict voter behavior based upon car and sport preferences, a well-publicized bit of political magic that captured the imaginations of politicians and journalists alike. Wagner’s approach, part of a broader move in politics, cut all of that out; why engage in such divination when you have the time and money to just call voters and ask them about their leanings directly? “We’re trying to predict political preference; we’re not trying to predict whether you buy a car,” Wagner says dismissively.","Photo","Left to right: Gaurav Shirole, Chris Frommann, Chauncey McLean, Will St. Clair.Credit\nAndrew Hetherington for The New York Times","The campaign couldn’t call the more than 150 million registered voters, obviously. But they could call enough of them in swing states (up to 11,000 a night) to figure out how they — and other people who lived near them, looked like them and earned like them — were likely to vote with an increasing degree of accuracy. In 2008, Wagner and his small team combined information from those calls with any other data they could find — census data, state voter lists and the like — and fed it into algorithms that produced support scores. One ranked how likely swing-state voters were to support Obama on a scale of 0 to 100, and another ranked how likely they were to show up at voting booths. Those scores helped the campaign direct resources toward the right voters, and Obama beat John McCain by 7 percentage points.","But even before the president took office, as the economy was in meltdown, his strategists, looking ahead four years, assumed that his re-election would not be easy. Wagner was assigned to the Democratic National Committee headquarters, where he set out to develop a far more sophisticated version of his analytics system, using bigger computer servers, better data on the nation’s voting-age population and more precise algorithms.","If there was any doubt about the system, it was dispelled after the 2010 special election in Massachusetts for the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by Edward M. Kennedy’s death. For much of the campaign, pollsters for the Democratic candidate, Martha Coakley, showed her ahead. Wagner and his group had their own numbers indicating that Coakley’s support was soft and dropping. His warnings went up the chain to the president, but some strategists dismissed him as if he were a “ ‘dumb kid,’ ” Wagner told me.","After Coakley lost and Wagner’s methods were validated, the Democratic Party poured money into Wagner’s department, which grew from 2 people to 15. Later that year, Wagner’s team developed the prototype for what Messina says he considers “an evolutionary jump”: a newly robust and reliable “persuasion score” that identified how easily individual undecided voters could be persuaded to vote for or against the Democrat in a race, based on how likely they were to show shifts in their preferences in telephone interviews conducted over time.","When Messina started up the Obama re-election campaign in 2011, he gave Wagner the go-ahead to nearly quadruple his team, which was moved to the cavernous office space at the Prudential Center in Chicago. This immediately made his analytics department one of the biggest of its kind in the country.","Obama supported the idea, aides said. But he warned in one early meeting against getting too deep into the data and “slicing the salami too thin,” as his communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, put it to me.","Soon after the office opened, Wagner’s group moved into a separate, windowless room, the cave. Messina said he wanted them to lose all sense of time and to focus. Wagner also cited the secret nature of the work. I once unknowingly wandered near the cave, looking for a bathroom, and a young press aide chased me down and escorted me away. (Because it was also near the kitchen, at the time I thought the aide was concerned I might try to force a metaphor out of an exposed piece of rotting fruit.)","“Anybody who had a computer and a basement as a kid saw the cave as a real opportunity,” Wagner told me. It was packed with about 40 desks, a number that was determined through a contest Wagner held among his staff to figure out how to “best utilize the floor plan.” The result came from “the best combination of square footage per person, subject to constraints: You couldn’t move your arms more than six inches without hitting somebody,” he said. On the back of the door his team would affix pieces of paper with snippets of conversation they heard from people who walked by: “Those people are weird, don’t go in there” or “That’s the secret sauce.” Across one wall there was a large printout of the surface of Mars, a mocking reference to a column in The Wall Street Journal in which Peggy Noonan described a job posting of Wagner’s as “politics as done by Martians.”","In fact, through his postings, Wagner assembled a team that included a biophysicist, who worked at the Stem Cell Initiative at Harvard and three professional poker players. The cave dwellers would take breaks at the Ping-Pong table out in the main offices with their peers; Gaurav Shirole, a 23-year-old data analyst and graduate of the business school at the University of California, Berkeley, who also joined A.M.G., became so good that when the president visited the campaign office during the summer, the staff volunteered Shirole to compete against Obama. (Shirole won, but got in trouble with his mother when she saw the photo of him playing in flip-flops and a T-shirt.)","Yet in truth, their task was daunting. Shortly after Messina opened the Chicago offices, Joel Benenson, the president’s national pollster, conducted a “benchmark” poll that had some sobering results. Roughly a fifth of Obama’s 2008 vote had shifted into the undecided column. “We knew we weren’t going to get all of them,” Benenson said. But the campaign needed to get back many millions of them. And it fell to Wagner’s team to figure out exactly who they were, to a man and to a woman, and then rank them according to a 0 to 10 persuasion score.","As the denizens of the cave were setting out to do that, the digital-analytics team, led by Rayid Ghani, a 35-year-old research scientist from Accenture Labs, developed an idea: Why not try sifting through self-described supporters’ Facebook pages in search of friends who might be on the campaign’s list of the most persuadable voters? Then the campaign could ask the self-identified supporters to bring their undecided friends along. The technique, as they saw it, could also get supporters to urge friends to register to vote, to vote early or to volunteer and donate.","Identifying persuadable friends became a significant undertaking. “We ended up building it from scratch because nothing like that existed,” Ghani told me. The computer code alone was thousands of lines, said Will St. Clair, 25, who helped write it and who also now works with McLean at A.M.G.","The campaign didn’t go into much detail, at the time, about exactly how it used Facebook. But St. Clair put it in fairly stark terms when I talked to him at A.M.G.’s temporary offices in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in April. They started with a list that grew to a million people who had signed into the campaign Web site through Facebook. When people opted to do so, they were met with a prompt asking to grant the campaign permission to scan their Facebook friends lists, their photos and other personal information. In another prompt, the campaign asked for access to the users’ Facebook news feeds, which 25 percent declined, St. Clair said.","Once permission was granted, the campaign had access to millions of names and faces they could match against their lists of persuadable voters, potential donors, unregistered voters and so on. “It would take us 5 to 10 seconds to get a friends list and match it against the voter list,” St. Clair said. They found matches about 50 percent of the time, he said. But the campaign’s ultimate goal was to deputize the closest Obama-supporting friends of voters who were wavering in their affections for the president. “We would grab the top 50 you were most active with and then crawl their wall” to figure out who were most likely to be their real-life friends, not just casual Facebook acquaintances. St. Clair, a former high-school marching-band member who now wears a leather Diesel jacket, explained: “We asked to see photos but really we were looking for who were tagged in photos with you, which was a really great way to dredge up old college friends — and ex-girlfriends,” he said.","The campaign’s exhaustive use of Facebook triggered the site’s internal safeguards. “It was more like we blew through an alarm that their engineers hadn’t planned for or knew about,” said St. Clair, who had been working at a small firm in Chicago and joined the campaign at the suggestion of a friend. “They’d sigh and say, ‘You can do this as long as you stop doing it on Nov. 7.’ ” (Facebook officials say warning bells go off when the site sees large amounts of unusual activity, but in each case the company was satisfied the campaign was not violating its privacy and data standards.)","By March 2012, Wagner’s team had a workable list of what it deemed to be the most persuadable voters — in total, roughly 15 million of them in the swing states. Messina ordered the campaign to direct a majority of its efforts toward winning them back, one by one if necessary. They could reach many through their Facebook friends and others through more conventional means like e-mail and knocking on doors. But how could the Obama campaign be as targeted and tech-savvy on TV?","The Internet, and specifically social media, may have fundamentally changed politics, but there is still nothing with the power to enrage or inspire like a well-produced television ad (see “47 percent, Romney”). This is in part because of the evocative nature of video, which can be transmitted over the Internet as well. But it’s also because that imagery is typically put in front of people when they are at their most receptive, zoning out on the couch, relaxing, their defenses down.","TV advertising has also historically been the most expensive and least efficient way to reach voters. Commercial TV time is still valued and sold in pretty much the same way as it was when people gathered every night to watch Walter Cronkite. Most advertising is based on audience ratings kept by Nielsen Media Research, which derives its information from a national survey of 22,000 households and smaller surveys in local markets, selected to perfectly represent the American television-viewing population, Nielsen says. Through “people meters” that monitor what specific members of these households are watching in real time and, in some cases, written diaries of its participating families, Nielsen does a reasonably good job of telling advertisers which demographic groups are watching which shows. Nielsen’s ratings categories are still dominated by the broad audience segment known as “adults 18 to 49,” but they can also include smaller groups like “women 18-plus” and “Hispanics.” If Revlon wants to sell its newest shade of lipstick, for example, it knows it can reach lots of women through a show like “Grey’s Anatomy.” If Miller Lite wants to get its shiny blue cans in front of young men in their beer-drinking prime, it knows it can do so through spots on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”","Political campaigns have typically shown most of their ads during news programs, where they can reach older viewers who are engaged in the topics of the day and, it stands to reason, are most likely to vote. If a pollster identified other broad groups that a candidate wanted to reach, like women or young men, then the campaign could venture out into other shows. Traditionally, “these are the tools that you have,” Grisolano told me one day at his office in Chicago, the L train screeching along the rails outside. “You have programming that overdelivers or underdelivers in broad, sweeping groups.”","The better that campaigns — and all major marketers — have become at identifying precisely whom they want to talk to, the more inefficient the old model can seem. For instance, a campaign may need to win over those 5 percent of independent, female, likely voters who are still undecided, but there is no separate ratings category for them, no precise way to know which shows they are watching. It’s very likely a campaign can speak to some of them through commercials on “Grey’s Anatomy,” but by buying time there, the campaign is spending a lot of money on an audience that is mostly made up of people the candidate actually does not need to speak to.","The 2012 Obama campaign knew it had to be especially efficient in buying television time because it expected to be outspent by the combined forces of the Romney campaign and super PACs, including the American Crossroads organization, co-founded by Karl Rove.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","“If we had to withstand being outspent — and nobody wanted to withstand it — but if we had to, we could tolerate being outspent with the people who have basically already made up their mind for us or the people who made up their mind against us,” Grisolano said. “But we were going to make sure that we put the full power of our buy with the people who were swing voters, who were on the edge. So, my task became, how do you create the tools you need to make that a reality?”","Grisolano was going to have one thing at his disposal that no presidential adviser had before him: Wagner’s list of roughly 15 million persuadable voters. But he had no way of knowing if he would be able to reach them with any real precision on TV. He turned to Amy Gershkoff, a young political scientist he met a couple of years before who was making a name for herself grappling with just these sorts of challenges. Gershkoff was 30 years old, had a Ph.D. from Princeton and had developed software that was making political ad buying more efficient. Gershkoff was digging more deeply into the Nielsen data and matching it against information in party-voter lists to get a better read on what shows key voting blocs — not generic television audiences — were watching. She was finding that a campaign could reach many of them in greater concentrations and for less money on cable channels like Lifetime than on more expensive shows with bigger audiences like “The Office.”","Grisolano recommended that Messina speak with her, and Messina hired her to be director of media planning, reporting directly to him. Messina wanted Gershkoff to build a master program that would allow him, as the campaign manager, to decide how to spend the campaign’s advertising budget across all mediums — not just television, but the Internet, radio, print ads and the mail — at optimum cost using real-time polling data to measure how the ads were moving or not moving opinion. (A version of this project would be built by McLean, whom Gershkoff brought with her, and Frommann, his deputy.)","But it soon became clear that such a system could eliminate the role of Obama’s longtime television-ad-buying firm, GMMB, run by the senior Obama strategist Jim Margolis, which stood to potentially lose millions in buying commissions. Colleagues described Margolis as furious. He called it “dumbfounded.” Grisolano and Axelrod backed him up in his argument that any savings on commissions would be wiped out in the chaos of recreating a system that already existed (and forgoing the expertise and relationships that Margolis’s 30-person buying team had in the television world).","Messina relented, but said that GMMB would take guidance from Gershkoff’s department. As Gershkoff put it to me gingerly when we spoke in May: “Fundamentally I was brought in to create tools that would help Jim spend nine digits’ worth of the campaign’s budget. Any time you’re moving that kind of money around, people can be resistant to the idea.”","There were other turf battles. Gershkoff was given her own analytics department to analyze media, but Wagner believed all analytics should be handled uniformly through his department, several former campaign officials said. (He wouldn’t discuss it with me when I asked about it.) The two had differences in other areas as well. Gershkoff insisted that her staff members wear business attire; Wagner, who often wore flip-flops, had only one requirement of his staff in the cave: “You have to wear clothes.”","But Gershkoff had come upon a cache of data that all the strategists would come to appreciate. She had contracted with a relatively new firm called Rentrak that was competing with Nielsen and was buying up real-time, raw viewing data directly from cable and satellite companies that had nearly 20 million set-top boxes in eight million homes. When Gershkoff told Grisolano, he was thrilled. Rentrak’s huge new trove of data, he surmised, could help him find out with relative certainty what shows were being delivered to the homes of the roughly 15 million persuadable voters Wagner’s department had identified.","The concept for the “optimizer,” as it was known in the campaign, was born: a system that could determine with more precision than ever what swing voters were watching in the greatest concentrations and how to get commercials in front of them in the cheapest advertising time slots possible. But making that idea a reality was going to be very difficult. “My first idea was, O.K., I’ve got a list of people who I know are targets here,” Grisolano said. “I’ve got a list of viewers and what they watch over here. Just match them up and spit out what TV shows my targets are watching.” He acknowledged that “what I didn’t necessarily fully grasp in my enthusiastic naïveté was that the size and magnitude of these data sets are apparently extraordinary, and the engineering feat of doing what I wanted to do was a lot more complicated than I envisioned it.”","That task would not ultimately be overseen by Gershkoff. By the end of 2011, she left the campaign, her tenure cut short by a family emergency, she said. When she re-emerged that spring, it was as the director of global analytics at the public relations and advertising firm Burson-Marsteller.","Responsibility for building the optimizer was handed off to Wagner. “We took over in January and then had to build it from scratch, completely from scratch,” he said. Fortunately, there happened to be a rare expert in set-top-box data, named Carol Davidsen, working in the cave. Davidsen looks younger than her 37 years — “no kids,” she says — and she speaks in a rapid, elliptical manner, as if her thoughts are running too fast for her sentences to keep pace. Before joining the campaign, she had a successful career as a forward-thinking data engineer. But she had become fed up with corporate life by the time she received an unsolicited e-mail from Wagner’s analytics department, which recruited employees by searching the 2008 online-donor list for those who listed themselves as programmers. “I’m a huge supporter of Barack Obama,” she said a few weeks ago at Think Coffee in Greenwich Village. “But I also was kind of at a time in my life where I needed to be part of a perfect team, and I knew that was possible in a world where people weren’t worried about getting a raise or people weren’t worried about getting a promotion.”","Her previous employer, Navic Networks, was a very early pioneer in the field of set-top-box data collection. And she was one of the early programmers to figure out how to make a television, designed as a one-way path for sending programming into American homes, relay information back about what exactly a viewer was watching.","Davidsen determined that Rentrak could roughly do what Grisolano wanted it to do: produce data that could be checked against Wagner’s list of most-persuadable voters to find matches. Rentrak had access to the set-top boxes in the homes of thousands of the targeted voters in every competitive market of every swing state. (For instance, Rentrak had 100,000 people in its Denver sample, some 20,000 of whom were on the Obama list; Nielsen had a total of 600 people in Denver.)","But there was the potentially politically explosive matter of privacy. Unlike Facebook, where users were at least giving the campaign explicit permission to collect personal data even if they had not read the fine print, television watchers were making no such agreement. To address this, the campaign and Rentrak hired a third party to “anonymize” the data so that they would only know that the information was coming from a set-top box of somebody on the persuadable list; identifying information would be stripped away.","The optimizer software would then comb advertising price and viewership data to figure out the top-rated time slots among those on the Obama persuadable list — which could vary from market to market — and then rank them based on which produced the highest concentration of the Obama swing voters at the best rates. The results were striking. The campaign determined that two of the top shows to buy were 1 a.m. repeats of “The Insider” and afternoon episodes of “Judge Joe Brown” — shows that were far cheaper than the evening news or anything being shown on the networks in prime time. “When you’re talking about ‘The Insider,’ that might be shift workers in a state like Ohio, folks who are working class and aren’t getting home until midnight,” said Daniel Jester, the head GMMB buyer, who was aggressively locking in low rates early. “The person watching ‘Judge Joe Brown’ in the afternoon also may be the same viewer watching ‘The Insider’ at 1 a.m.”","The Romney campaign was not pursuing these same voters the same way. If they had been, Davidsen told me, the market would have become competitive, prices would have spiked and the system would have lost some of its advantage. As far as the Obama team was concerned, the optimizer helped it do what most strategists deemed impossible in a campaign between two well-financed opponents — talk to undecided voters through television advertisements on shows on which the opposition was not running a countermessage.","By Election Day, the Obama campaign had done far more to utilize cable and to run ads at odd times of day — who watches “Area 51” on Syfy at 2:30 a.m.? — than Romney had. In all, Obama ran nearly twice as many cable ads as Romney did, 588,006, on more than twice as many channels, 100, according to analysis by NCC Media, which helped both campaigns place spots.","It is not that the Romney campaign was unaware such technology could be developed. Rentrak, a nonpartisan vendor, reached out to offer its services in the spring of 2012 but found no takers. The former Bush strategist Sara Fagen worked with the Romney consulting firm TargetPoint to develop a competing optimizing service, but, she said, the media team “chose not to use it.” (She is now working with some TargetPoint colleagues to develop one for a new company they are forming, Deep Root Analytics.)","Stuart Stevens, Romney’s chief strategist, said the campaign used plenty of data to inform its television buying. But as far as he was concerned, Fagen was one of many offering some new service. The Romney campaign, he said, had a different mission than Obama’s. “We still were trying to inform likely voters who Mitt Romney was,” he said, “and until you get those voters, you’re insane to go off and say, ‘We’re going to try to win this with left-handed Lithuanians.’ ”","In the end, an analysis by the Republican ad-buying firm National Media found that Obama paid roughly 35 percent less per broadcast commercial than Romney did. Kantar Media CMAG, an ad-monitoring firm, showed that Obama and his supporting super PAC got nearly 40,000 more spots on the air than Romney and his super PACs did despite spending roughly $90 million less.","The day after Obama won 51 percent of the vote, he visited his Chicago staff, including those on the analytics team. Davidsen said Obama hugged her and signed a favorite piece of cave paraphernalia, a replica of a narwhal tusk. “An honor,” she said.","When the campaign ended, Obama’s team of tech experts did not exactly knock down the door of the White House personnel office looking to put their newfound tools into the service of the new presidential agenda. They were heading East and West — to Silicon Valley, Wall Street and, in the case of A.M.G., Las Vegas — in search of venture capital and clients.","There is, of course, a tradition of political operatives leaving presidential campaigns to cash in on the corporate side. This has often been to join the public-policy campaigns of a given industry or company between political bouts, or perhaps to help with some brand and image management.","But there is just as much of a tradition in Democratic politics, especially among the young, to keep the fight alive after a campaign’s end. The young staff members of the McGovern campaign left that particularly demoralizing endeavor to re-engage with their causes and their party; the Web-pioneering Deaniacs went on to feed the ranks of MoveOn and the 2008 Obama campaign.","The Obama political movement had tended to hold itself apart from the corporate world, its members galvanized by what they saw as an opportunity to change the country. But after Election Day in November, huge political success met financial opportunity. The people in their 20s and 30s from the Obama tech team had seen others just like them get incredibly rich on innovations (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) that were as transformational as anything they could hope to achieve in government. Now they started to think about what innovations they could bring to the market.","A.M.G. may be the most baldly commercial of the new crop of companies coming out of the cave, but they are all trying to translate what they learned there into future success. A few weeks ago, Wagner announced he was starting a new firm called Civis Analytics with an investment from Eric Schmidt, the Google executive chairman, who was a technology adviser during the campaign. As Wagner described it to me, he would use analytics to help nonprofit and for-profit companies reach out to segments of the population they were struggling to connect with. One of his first clients is the College Board, which runs the national SAT test. Civis will identify “kids who are low-income, high-achieving but not meeting their college potential.” The “commercial applicability is wide,” he said, so the company will not be averse to working with big, for-profit companies of all kinds.","Carol Davidsen was also recruited by A.M.G., but she decided to take the lessons of the Obama campaign in a different direction. If anything, her approach is almost anticorporate, even though she said she was not against getting rich if she could. Her company, called Cir.cl, which she founded with a campaign programmer, Joshua Thayer, endeavors to find people with complementary interests who may have reason to do business with each other, like parents with baby equipment to dispose of and parents-to-be in the market for that equipment. She calls it “recommerce.”","“I have a lot of friends with kids,” she said one recent Friday at her new office, a bouncy-ball and Mac-strewn onetime closet space in an industrial building in Downtown Brooklyn. “There’s this little plastic play house. Does every single one of those need to go into a garbage dump? Why did we give up on doing business with each other? Why is it always to big corporations? It doesn’t have to be.” Explaining her choice to me, she said, “I don’t want to spend my time optimizing for Coke.”","When I talked to Chauncey McLean in Brooklyn in April, he walked me through how the campaign’s technological achievements could translate into services provided to private businesses, like Caesars. The casino had gobs of data on its customers. “We have a giant list of people, and we need to make a model of likely customers,” he said. A.M.G. would break them down along a range of Caesars Scores, à la Wagner’s persuadable scores. Then A.M.G. could work through it and direct advertising toward those whose visits had fallen off: find what they watch via Rentrak in the greatest concentrations and then ply them with TV advertising.","Over several meetings with McLean and his young A.M.G. staff members, I asked them to talk about the switch in mission from getting Obama elected to helping Fortune 500 companies sell stuff. Will St. Clair, who helped write the campaign’s Facebook program, said he saw himself as a programmer first and foremost and only joined A.M.G. after deciding that he didn’t want “to play the Internet start-up billionaire game, which is a lot less fun than it looks on paper.” Gaurav Shirole said he was considering a job in the Treasury Department when McLean approached him. “I’m a Silicon Valley kid, so the start-up bug has been there forever.”","Frommann acknowledged having ventured into politics with a certain idealism. “We’ve all watched ‘The West Wing,’ like, four times, and we want to do our small part to change the world,” he said. Politics, he said, was emotionally satisfying. Corporate clients meant new data sets, “stuff I haven’t worked with before, intellectually that’s interesting to me.”","Still, it was hard not to detect some deeper disappointment about what was possible in politics. Frommann told me that in 2010, shortly after college, he joined the Social Security Administration. Within a year, he had helped develop a new system that, he said, would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year. Just as his idea was gaining traction, his entire unit was disbanded, the ostensible result of budget cuts but also, he surmised, bureaucratic infighting. Sometimes, he said, it seems as if political life can be as much like “The West Wing” as it is like “House of Cards,” the Netflix show about a conniving member of Congress living in a kill-or-be-killed Washington.","McLean says Grisolano wooed him by awarding him with the title of chief operating officer and wide latitude to hire whomever he needed. He was also drawn to Grisolano’s sales pitch that the optimizer approach could prove a disruptive force in a $60 billion commercial-advertising industry. It spoke to the same desire to be part of something big that led him to join the first Obama campaign. “This is going to be a huge deal, right?” he said “It’s a multibillion-dollar industry, and we’re going to change the way that it works.”","He said his work at A.M.G. would also help provide the Democratic Party with even better tools three years from now, when he and his colleagues say they want to be involved in 2016. “We’re going to bring it home,” McLean said.","But for now, he does not seem to miss Washington. “I respect everybody who’s working for the president — right? They’re incredible kids — incredible people — but you have a limited movement, because you’re hamstrung; the House is the House,” he said. “When you go where the money is and you go where people get reached, you have a transformational effect. Money creates change.”","Jim Rutenberg is a national political correspondent for The New York Times."],"isopubdate":"2013-06-20"}

During that discussion, you encouraged me to pass along names of people who might be good additions to a technology operation.\nThere are 3 main jobs that I think you should personally concern yourself with:\nChief Digital Officer\nChief Technology Officer\nHead of Analytics\nI could put together a list of candidates for you for each of these three jobs but here's the thing --- I think your campaign's approach to building a digital/tech & analytics operations should break with how it is normally done.\nNormally in campaigns, a small number of candidates with close ties to people in leadership (candidate, campaign manager, chairman, pollster) are vetted and a tech team is quickly built. There is some judgment brought to the evaluation, but the hires are normally rooted in relationships and recent performance.\nI think that process would not serve you well. I think that you need to cast a wider net and I think that you need something that is very unusual in political campaigns for top hires: a formal HR process.\nThere are a lot of kick-ass tech/digital/analytics operatives out there, but most of them have become part of a new consultant class that has emerged since the 2008 campaign made millionaires out of lots of guys in their 20s.\nDon't get me wrong, these are good people; and many of them should be hired and/or get contracts for the technology they have spent years building and applying in actual campaigns. Many of these are also my friends --- I have lots of beer drinking buddies among them.\nMy worry is that the real A listers from this community will want to stay at their firms and make a lot of money off of a campaign that is going to spend north of a billion dollars when what you really need are people who are going to work 15 hours a day, 7 days a week sitting inside the campaign HQ who have all the technology skills but are primarily motivated to work in a Hillary Clinton for President campaign out of a sense of mission. These may be highly skilled people from Silicon Valley who would love to be a part your campaign but who lack the relationships to find their place inside a campaign without a more formal hiring process. These folks, in turn, should manage the consultants/vendors rather than the consultants/vendors managing the people inside the campaign.\nIn order to get people who combine both the great technology skills and the sense of mission, I'd suggest you put the kind of HR process in place that looks much more like what you'd find at McKinsey than at a campaign. The campaign manager, chairman and pollster should all be involved, but I would also bring in an HR professional to manage the process and then leverage the ties you have to people in the technology world (beyond me this includes people like Eric Schmidt, Sheryl Sandberg, Katie Stanton and Katie Dowd) who both know you and your needs but who also know how to vet technology and have relationships that go far beyond what are now the normal suspects from the \"tech in campaigns world\". Again, lots of those are great people, but in addition to the important roles they will play we need to find HILLARY PEOPLE.\nI am also always happy to put together small meetings for you with people who are a mixture of Silicon Valley and the previous Obama campaigns (from digital/tech/analytics) if you want to benefit from other perspectives. They are all eager to meet you.\nApologies for the long email, but I wanted to give you my uncensored perspective. If what I propose does not work given choices you have already made, no worries, I will send in suggestions of potential hires. You will end up with great people either way.\nMy best,\nAlec"],"isopubdate":""}

Spokeswomen say the data is not sold or shared with users' friends or outside apps. They say the data is used \"to improve people's experience across Facebook\" by helping to connect with others.","The company also says in a website posting that it does not collect the content of text messages or calls. A spokeswoman told the Associated Press that Facebook uses the information to rank contacts in Messenger so they are easier to find, and to suggest people to call.","Users get the option to allow data collection when they sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite, the Facebook posting said. \"If you chose to turn this feature on, we will begin to continuously log this information,\" the posting said.","The data collection can be turned off in a user's settings, and all previously collected call and text history shared on the app will be deleted, Facebook said.","The feature was first introduced on Facebook Messenger in 2015 and added later on Facebook Lite.","Messages were left Sunday seeking comment about security from Google officials, who make the Android operating system.","Reports of the data collection came as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took out ads in multiple U.S. and British Sunday newspapers to apologize for the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The ads say the social media platform doesn't deserve to hold personal information if it can't protect it.","According to the ads, a quiz app built by a Cambridge University researcher leaked Facebook data of millions of people four years ago. Zuckerberg said this was a \"breach of trust\" and that Facebook is taking steps to make sure it doesn't happen again.","Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm, got data inappropriately. The social media platform's stock value has dropped over $70 billion since the revelations were first published.","Among the newspapers with the ads were The New York Times and The Washington Post in the U.S., and The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph in the United Kingdom.","The ads said Facebook is limiting the data apps received when users sign in. It's also investigating every app that had access to large amounts of data. \"We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,\" the ads stated.","Cambridge Analytica got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million.","The Trump campaign paid the firm $6 million during the 2016 election, although it has since distanced itself from Cambridge.","Online Public Information File","Viewers with disabilities can get assistance accessing this station's FCC Public Inspection File by contacting the station with the information listed below.

Free labor is Facebook's lifeblood","Cambridge Analytica may have been the straw that broke the camel's back for Facebook users.","Image: bob al-greene/mashable","By Casey Williams2018-03-26 16:47:32 UTC","Chances are, you work for Facebook.","You probably don't have an office or an ID card. And you almost certainly don't get paid. But if you're one of the 239 million Americans who use the platform each month, your work is as valuable as a coder's. Maybe more. Your clicks, likes, and posts keep content circulating, users scrolling, and data streaming into algorithms used to serve you ads. Leave, and the platform crumbles.","You do two jobs for Facebook. You generate data and produce content. Facebook is essentially an advertising company, and every bit of information you disclose is data advertisers can use to influence how and what you buy. Sometimes it's fairly benign (maybe you do want that Blue Apron subscription). Other times it's not. Data is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to shape your behavior, and as Cambridge Analytica shows, it can be dangerous.","Your job is to drive people to the platform and keep them there","You also create most of what's on Facebook. You write posts, share photos, and capture live video of speeches, protests, and police shootings. The time and effort you sink into crafting a poetic confession, an impassioned rant, a thoughtful reflection on the day's news — think of it as work you do for Facebook. You're working to keep the site humming and vibrant, and you're creating reasons for others to keep scrolling. Your job is to drive people to the platform and keep them there.","And you spend a lot of time doing it. In 2016, users spent an average of 50 minutes a day using Facebook products, including Instagram and Messenger. That number has declined recently, but let's say you spend, say, 35 minutes a day on the site. That's 26 eight-hour days a year — \"more than any other leisure activity surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the exception of watching television programs and movies,\" according to the New York Times. \"It's more time than people spend reading (19 minutes); participating in sports or exercise (17 minutes); or social events (four minutes).\"","Time Well Spent?","Leisure is labor on Facebook. People use the app voluntarily, and yet, as more and more social activities relocate to the internet, it's increasingly work people feel they have to do to live meaningful, connected lives. Facebook is a News Feed, photo album, personal archive, community forum, and more. Think, for a second, about deleting Facebook. What will happen to your photos? Where will you get your news? Will anyone remember your birthday?","Like all social media companies, Facebook makes money from the basic labors of life: our need to maintain friendships and family ties, keep up with news, form and share beliefs about the world. \"What appears, at first glance, to be a free activity of communication,\" researchers at the University Lüneburg and University of Essex wrote in a recent paper, \"is in fact a form of 'free labor.'\"","It's valuable labor, too. The company earned nearly $16 billion in profit in 2017, according to its annual earnings report. Most of that was from ad revenue, which jumped nearly 50 percent.","Free labor has always made the U.S. economy hum. Slavery got the country on its feet, and unpaid house work — cooking, cleaning and child care, still done mostly by women — has for over two centuries made it possible for people to wake up every morning and go to work. The effort we put into caring for others is labor, and women still do most of that, too. While employers mostly benefit from this unpaid work indirectly, social media companies go right to the source. They extract value directly from the work we do to stay connected to the world.","This kind of extraction isn't unique to Facebook, or even to social media. The idea of a \"prosumer\" — a consumer who also produces — dates back to the 1980s. Sites like Yelp rely on users to generate reviews; Spotify asks listeners to fill in missing album data; Medium makes money from amateur writers looking to publish. Like Facebook, these sites often frame your work as an opportunity to \"connect\" or \"share.\" Not paying for this work is called \"crowdsourcing.\"","Critics of this model say it's exploitation. Eric Posner, a legal theorist at the University of Chicago, has called Twitter users a \"slave labor force,\" and small-time YouTube celebrities have objected to the platform's efforts to make it harder for YouTubers to monetize videos.","Whatever else it is, social media is work","Whatever else it is, social media is work. People who create content for a living understand this better than most. If you're a photographer, you have to be on Instagram. And if you're a journalist, you have to be on Twitter. It’s where you find breaking news, promote work, and get gigs — often on your own time. Ditching Twitter \"would be a disaster\" for writers and the companies they work for, Ethan Klapper, HuffPost’s global social media editor, told the New Republic in 2017.","The nonstop churn of social media skews what kind of work has monetary value. Amateur reporters break news before professionals, so media companies expect writers to churn out reports off the clock. And when the internet is awash in content, no one wants to shell out for words and images they can get for free.","Yes, a few social media users have figured out how to turn their work into cash. Modern celebrities like PewDiePie and the #vanlife couple have used social platforms to launch lucrative careers. It's easy to envy these people; after all, they rake in cash doing what everyone else does for free. But the fact that some people get paid is evidence of the value of every user's labor.","Maybe we all deserve a little something. After all, we don't really use Facebook; we make it.","Casey Williams is a writer based in Durham, North Carolina.

Kogan maintains that he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","Facebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor – Kogan’s business partner at the time their company acquired the data, using an app called thisisyourdigitallife.","Cambridge Analytica – a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon – used the data to build sophisticated psychological profiles of US voters.","Facebook’s public statements have omitted any reference to GSR, the company Kogan incorporated in May 2014 with Chancellor, who at the time was a postdoctoral research assistant.","The Guardian asked Facebook several questions about its recruitment of Chancellor and any action it had taken in light of the data harvesting scam conducted by GSR. Facebook initially promised to respond to a set of questions by Sunday, but then said it had nothing to say on the matter. Chancellor did not respond to repeated requests for comment.","The psychologist, who is 38, is understood to have been a junior partner to Kogan, who oversaw GSR’s business dealings and then elicited the help of several of his students. One source with some knowledge of Chancellor’s role at the company described him as “just the data guy”.","However, both Kogan and Chancellor were listed as directors of GSR when it was founded and provided a “service address” in Harley Street, London.","In the months that followed the creation of GSR, the company worked in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica to pay hundreds of thousands ofusers to take the test as part of an agreement in which they agreed for their data to be collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions strong. That data sold to Cambridge Analytica as part of a commercial agreement. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising.","Chancellor resigned his directorship of GSR in September 2015, according to company records. He joined Facebook around November 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile.","The following month, the Guardian published the first story detailing how Kogan and Chancellor’s company had unethically sourced data that was then passed to Cambridge Analytica, which at the time was working for the presidential campaign of Ted Cruz.","Facebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor at that stage. His role at Facebook was mentioned in a story by the Intercept 12 months ago. At that time, Facebook said in a statement: “The work that he did previously has no bearing on the work that he does at Facebook.”","Chancellor, who was conducting postdoctoral research at Cambridge University when GSR was set up, is understood to have been one of several students who Kogan involved in his project.","Data scandal is huge blow for Facebook – and efforts to study its impact on society","Read more","Since joining Facebook, some of Chancellor’s academic research has been published in peer-reviewed journals. However, the precise nature of his work for Facebook is unclear. The company employs many in-house social scientists to conduct research on the psychology of its users.","In 2014, Facebook was revealed to have conducted a vast experiment on users, without their consent, which entailed tweaking the amount of positive and negative content appearing on their feeds to see if the tech giant could manipulate some kind of “emotional contagion”.","Last year, leaked documents revealed how Facebook had told advertisers they had the capacity to monitor posts in real time and identify when teenage users were feeling “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”.","That kind of finite information is invaluable to advertisers – whether selling products or political candidates – as it helps them more effectively tailor and target their message to individual users on the platform.","Facebook’s ability to create granular profiles of its users has been at the very core of its business model, transforming the social media platform into one of the most profitable companies on the planet."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Throughout the last year, every time bad news has broken, executives have downplayed its significance. Look at its public statements last year about how many people had seen Russian-bought election ads — first it was 10 million, then it was 126 million.","Top execs dodged Congress when it was asking questions about Russian interference. They are selling their shares at a record clip.","The actions of Facebook execs now recall how execs at Nokia and Blackberry reacted after the iPhone emerged. Their revenues kept growing for a couple years -- and they dismissed the threats. By the time users started leaving in droves, it was too late.","There's no outside attacker bringing Facebook down. It's a circular firing squad that stems from the company's fundamental business model of collecting data from users, and using that data to sell targeted ads. For years, users went along with the bargain. But after almost a year of constant negative publicity, their patience may be waning.","Facebook did not initially respond to questions or a request for comment from CNBC.","The drumbeat","For more than a year now, Facebook has been deflecting stories about how its platform was used during the 2016 presidential election.","Some of this activity — like Facebook embedding workers with the Trump campaign to tell them how to advertise more effectively — was perfectly legal, and in line with normal business practices. A lot of these tactics would probably have drawn no scrutiny if Donald Trump hadn't surprised everybody by winning an election that all the polls showed him losing.","Other activity was against Facebook's policies, or outright illegal. Most notably, a U.S. grand jury recently indicted 13 Russian nationals for conducting a disinformation campaign on American soil intended to further political divisions in the country and sway the election toward Trump. Their tactics included using Facebook groups to organize divisive political protests and buying targeted ads.","CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has remained aloof throughout the whole sequence of events.","He addresses some of these issues on personal Facebook posts, but seldom talks to the press about them. Last year, he spent most of the year doing photo ops with people around America, but did not show up when Congress asked questions about how the Russians used Facebook to influence the 2016 election.","This year, he announced his annual personal challenge would be fixing Facebook — in other words, doing his job as the CEO of a publicly traded company worth more than $500 billion. In past years, he's taught himself Mandarin and hunted his own food.","The spin","Over the weekend, Facebook gave a case study in how the company reacts inappropriately to negative news.","On Friday night, Facebook made a surprise announcement that the company had suspended a political analytics research firm, Cambridge Analytica. The firm was funded by large Republican donor Robert Mercer, and Trump's campaign used it to target ads on Facebook.","In its Friday post, Facebook claimed it had discovered new evidence that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted data about Facebook users passed to it by a Russian-American researcher, who had collected it through a personality quiz that 270,000 Facebook users took. The data included information like the cities where users lived and what they had \"liked\" on Facebook.","It was against Facebook's terms of use for the researcher to pass the data along. Cambridge Analytica had told Facebook it had deleted the data back in 2015, but Facebook said it had received recent reports to the contrary, according to the blog post.","(Cambridge Analytica has countered the allegations, saying it was in compliance with Facebook's guidelines, and that no data collected through the app was used in the Trump campaign.)","But as is often the case in political scandal, the problem isn't so much the original action, but the cover-up. Or in this case, the spin.","It turns out that Facebook didn't just spontaneously decide to ban the political research firm. It was actually trying to get ahead of two bombshell reports, in the New York Times and The Observer (the Sunday edition of U.K. paper The Guardian). The publications detailed exactly how Cambridge Analytica had collected information about Facebook users in a bid to target them with political messages.","Facebook knew about these news stories for some time. It also appears that the company was trying to squelch the reports.","The Times report claimed that, in private conversations with the newspaper, Facebook \"downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control.\" The Guardian wrote that \"Facebook's external lawyers warned the Observer it was making 'false and defamatory' allegations, and reserved Facebook's legal position.\"","The stories went ahead anyway. Once they were published, Facebook executives immediately took to Twitter to defend the company, insisting that this was not a \"breach.\"","In tweets that were later deleted, Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos called the stories \"important and powerful,\" while insisting that it was \"incorrect to call it a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\" The deleted tweets are preserved below:","So far, more than 24 hours after the stories, Zuckerberg and his number-two, COO Sheryl Sandberg, have not responded.","Missing the point","The Facebook executives who responded are correct — there was no security breach. Users gave their information willingly. Moreover, Facebook has since put better security controls for apps in place, so users can more easily control what information apps are gathering and how they're using it.","But they're missing the point.","Facebook users are slowly learning that almost anybody can use Facebook to collect detailed information about them, and that — at least some of the time — Facebook cannot control where this information flows, or how it is used. Using Facebook is like writing your life story down on a piece of paper, then taping it to a lamppost.","Journalists and privacy advocates may roll their eyes at this \"revelation\" — they've been warning people about Facebook and privacy since its inception.","Users mostly ignored these warnings. They wanted to share photos, connect with old friends, play games, take quizzes and watch videos, and Facebook gave them a simple way to do it. More than 2 billion people around the world now use the 14-year-old service, and Facebook sold nearly $40 billion worth of ads last year.","But things are beginning to change. There's a growing sense that Facebook has become creepy instead of fun.","A lot of people are noticing that the ads on Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram are so precisely targeted, they're sure the company is eavesdropping on their conversations through their phone microphones. (Facebook swears it is not — CNBC's Michelle Castillo has a great explanation of what is probably going on.)","More to the point, people are starting to curb their Facebook usage. In the fourth quarter, for the first time ever, the number of people in North America who used Facebook every day dropped from the previous year.","Also, Zuckerberg told investors on the company's earnings call that the company saw a 5 percent drop in time spent on Facebook during the quarter. The company claimed that this reduced engagement was because of some technical changes that Facebook made to crack down on low-quality content and give users a more positive experience.","These are just two small metrics. Facebook is still growing in many regions and by many other measurements.","But still: Fewer people using Facebook every day in one region, and spending less time on it. That's never happened before.","For the time being, advertisers are grumbling about Facebook and warning their clients to stay away from certain ad products, but they're still putting their money there — with an audience over 2 billion and some of the most accurate ad targeting available, Facebook is still impossible to ignore.","But if usage continues to decline, advertisers will start eventually follow. And there are plenty of hungry smaller competitors — Twitter and Snap, particularly — who would be happy to take some of that money.","Executive stock sales not reassuring","Meanwhile, Facebook executives are not exactly sending a reassuring message to investors by unloading their shares at a rapid clip.","Last summer, after Zuckerberg's plan to create another class of stock to solidify his control of the company foundered, he announced he'd begin selling off up to 75 million shares (about 18 percent of his stake), worth nearly $13 billion, by mid-2019. The money will support the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), his other company devoted to good works.","Why now? Zuckerberg is 33 years old -- far from retirement. What exactly is CZI doing that requires such a massive investment? Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is building rocket ships to explore space with his other company Blue Origin, and he only needs to spend $1 billion a year.","Other top executives are also selling in massive amounts. Jan Koum, who founded the messaging app WhatsApp, which Facebook bought in 2014 for $19 billion, sold $2.8 billion worth of shares last year — more than any exec at any major tech company. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sold $2 billion of stock last year, in part to fund Blue Origin. Nobody else is close.)","Sandberg sold over $300 million, which pales in comparison to her colleagues but is still unusually large among officers of top tech companies.","Facebook stock is up over 80 percent in the last 12 months. Perhaps these execs are just taking gains, as any normal employee with stock compensation would be advised to do.","But these are not normal employees. They're the leaders of the company.","Other leaders keep skin in the game during difficult times -- think of how Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer held on to most of his stock throughout his tenure, even as Microsoft faced expensive antitrust lawsuits and growing competitive threats, or how Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey bought shares in 2017 when many investors had written the company off.","Facebook is facing real problems. Instead of giving answers to those problems, top execs are selling, spinning and staying silent."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

On the back end, we have many advanced sub-systems and infrastructures in place that make such a real-time experience possible, and our scalable, high-performance network is one of them.","Facebook’s production network by itself is a large distributed system with specialized tiers and technologies for different tasks: edge, backbone, and data centers. In this post, we will focus on the latest developments in our data center networking and unveil the next-generation architecture that we have successfully deployed in our new Altoona facility: data center fabric.","Moving fast, @scale","Facebook’s network infrastructure needs to constantly scale and evolve, rapidly adapting to our application needs. The amount of traffic from Facebook to Internet – we call it “machine to user” traffic – is large and ever increasing, as more people connect and as we create new products and services. However, this type of traffic is only the tip of the iceberg. What happens inside the Facebook data centers – “machine to machine” traffic – is several orders of magnitude larger than what goes out to the Internet.","Our back-end service tiers and applications are distributed and logically interconnected. They rely on extensive real-time “cooperation” with each other to deliver a fast and seamless experience on the front end, customized for each person using our apps and our site. We are constantly optimizing internal application efficiency, but nonetheless the rate of our machine-to-machine traffic growth remains exponential, and the volume has been doubling at an interval of less than a year.","The ability to move fast and support rapid growth is at the core of our infrastructure design philosophy. At the same time, we are always striving to keep our networking infrastructure simple enough that small, highly efficient teams of engineers can manage it. Our goal is to make deploying and operating our networks easier and faster over time, despite the scale and exponential growth.","The limits of clusters","Our previous data center networks were built using clusters. A cluster is a large unit of deployment, involving hundreds of server cabinets with top of rack (TOR) switches aggregated on a set of large, high-radix cluster switches. More than three years ago, we developed a reliable layer3 “four-post” architecture, offering 3+1 cluster switch redundancy and 10x the capacity of our previous cluster designs. But as effective as it was in our early data center builds, the cluster-focused architecture has its limitations.","First, the size of a cluster is limited by the port density of the cluster switch. To build the biggest clusters we needed the biggest networking devices, and those devices are available only from a limited set of vendors. Additionally, the need for so many ports in a box is orthogonal to the desire to provide the highest bandwidth infrastructure possible. Evolutionary transitions to the next interface speed do not come at the same XXL densities quickly. Operationally, the bigger bleeding-edge boxes are not better for us either. They have proprietary internal architectures that require extensive platform-specific hardware and software knowledge to operate and troubleshoot. With large areas of the datacenter depending on just a few boxes, the impact of hardware and software failures can also be significant.","Even more difficult is maintaining an optimal long-term balance between cluster size, rack bandwidth, and bandwidth out of the cluster. The whole concept of a “cluster” was born from a networking limitation – it was dictated by a need to position a large amount of compute resources (server racks) within an area of high network performance supported by the internal capacity of the large cluster switches. Traditionally, inter-cluster connectivity is oversubscribed, with much less bandwidth available between the clusters than within them. This assumes and then dictates that most intra-application communications occur inside the cluster. However, our application scales by being distributed and should not be constrained by these tight boundaries. There are many clusters in our typical data center, and machine-to-machine traffic grows between them and not just within them. Allocating more ports to accommodate inter-cluster traffic takes away from the cluster sizes. With rapid and dynamic growth, this balancing act never ends – unless you change the rules.","Introducing the fabric","For our next-generation data center network design we challenged ourselves to make the entire data center building one high-performance network, instead of a hierarchically oversubscribed system of clusters. We also wanted a clear and easy path for rapid network deployment and performance scalability without ripping out or customizing massive previous infrastructures every time we need to build more capacity.","To achieve this, we took a disaggregated approach: Instead of the large devices and clusters, we broke the network up into small identical units – server pods – and created uniform high-performance connectivity between all pods in the data center.","There is nothing particularly special about a pod – it’s just like a layer3 micro-cluster. The pod is not defined by any hard physical properties; it is simply a standard “unit of network” on our new fabric. Each pod is served by a set of four devices that we call fabric switches, maintaining the advantages of our current 3+1 four-post architecture for server rack TOR uplinks, and scalable beyond that if needed. Each TOR currently has 4 x 40G uplinks, providing 160G total bandwidth capacity for a rack of 10G-connected servers.","Figure 1: A sample pod – our new unit of network","What’s different is the much smaller size of our new unit – each pod has only 48 server racks, and this form factor is always the same for all pods. It’s an efficient building block that fits nicely into various data center floor plans, and it requires only basic mid-size switches to aggregate the TORs. The smaller port density of the fabric switches makes their internal architecture very simple, modular, and robust, and there are several easy-to-find options available from multiple sources.","Another notable difference is how the pods are connected together to form a data center network. For each downlink port to a TOR, we are reserving an equal amount of uplink capacity on the pod’s fabric switches, which allows us to scale the network performance up to statistically non-blocking.","To implement building-wide connectivity, we created four independent “planes” of spine switches, each scalable up to 48 independent devices within a plane. Each fabric switch of each pod connects to each spine switch within its local plane. Together, pods and planes form a modular network topology capable of accommodating hundreds of thousands of 10G-connected servers, scaling to multi-petabit bisection bandwidth, and covering our data center buildings with non-oversubscribed rack-to-rack performance.","Figure 2: Schematic of Facebook data center fabric network topology","For external connectivity, we equipped our fabric with a flexible number of edge pods, each capable of providing up to 7.68Tbps to the backbone and to back-end inter-building fabrics on our data center sites, and scalable to 100G and higher port speeds within the same device form factors.","This highly modular design allows us to quickly scale capacity in any dimension, within a simple and uniform framework. When we need more compute capacity, we add server pods. When we need more intra-fabric network capacity, we add spine switches on all planes. When we need more extra-fabric connectivity, we add edge pods or scale uplinks on the existing edge switches.","How we did it","When we first thought about building the fabric, it seemed complicated and intimidating because of the number of devices and links. However, what we were able to achieve ended up being more simple, elegant, and operationally efficient than our customary cluster designs. Here’s how we got there.","Network technology","We took a “top down” approach – thinking in terms of the overall network first, and then translating the necessary actions to individual topology elements and devices.","We were able to build our fabric using standard BGP4 as the only routing protocol. To keep things simple, we used only the minimum necessary protocol features. This enabled us to leverage the performance and scalability of a distributed control plane for convergence, while offering tight and granular routing propagation management and ensuring compatibility with a broad range of existing systems and software. At the same time, we developed a centralized BGP controller that is able to override any routing paths on the fabric by pure software decisions. We call this flexible hybrid approach “distributed control, centralized override.”","The network is all layer3 – from TOR uplinks to the edge. And like all our networks, it’s dual stack, natively supporting both IPv4 and IPv6. We’ve designed the routing in a way that minimizes the use of RIB and FIB resources, allowing us to leverage merchant silicon and keep the requirements to switches as basic as possible.","For most traffic, our fabric makes heavy use of equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing, with flow-based hashing. There are a very large number of diverse concurrent flows in a Facebook data center, and statistically we are seeing almost ideal load distribution across all fabric links. To prevent occasional “elephant flows” from taking over and degrading an end-to-end path, we’ve made the network multi-speed – with 40G links between all switches, while connecting the servers on 10G ports on the TORs. We also have server-side means to “hash away” and route around trouble spots, if they occur.","Gradual scalability","While we need a clear and predictable path to scale our capacity, we don’t necessarily require a non-blocking network in every deployment from day one.","To achieve the seamless growth capability, we’ve designed and planned the whole network as an end-to-end non-oversubscribed environment. We’ve allocated all necessary physical resources for full fabric device park, and we pre-built all the time-consuming passive infrastructure “skeleton” components. But our current starting point is 4:1 fabric oversubscription from rack to rack, with only 12 spines per plane, out of 48 possible. This level allows us to achieve the same forwarding capacity building-wide as what we previously had intra-cluster.","When the need comes, we can increase this capacity in granular steps, or we can quickly jump to 2:1 oversubscription, or even full 1:1 non-oversubscribed state at once. All we need to do is add more spine devices to each of the planes, and all physical and logical resources for that are already in place to make it a quick and simple operation.","Physical infrastructure","Despite the large scale of hundreds of thousands of fiber strands, fabric’s physical and cabling infrastructure is far less complex than it may appear from the logical network topology drawings. We’ve worked together across multiple Facebook infrastructure teams to optimize our third-generation data center building designs for fabric networks, shorten cabling lengths, and enable rapid deployment. Our Altoona data center is the first implementation of this new building layout.","From a server rack or data hall MDF standpoint, there is almost no change – the TORs just connect to their four independent aggregation points, same as with clusters before. For spine and edge devices, we’ve designed special independent locations at the center of the building, which we call BDF rooms. The BDFs are being constructed and pre-equipped with fabric early in the building turn-up process. The data halls are then identically attached to the BDFs as they get built, which drastically reduces network deployment time.","The massive fiber runs from the fabric switches in the data hall MDFs to spine switches in the BDFs are actually simple and identical “straight line” trunks. All fabric complexity is localized within BDFs, where it is very manageable. We consider each spine plane, with its corresponding trunks and pathways, one failure domain that we can safely take out of service at any time without production impact. To further optimize fiber lengths, we’ve also positioned our backbone devices in the MPOE rooms directly above the fabric BDFs. This allowed us to use short vertical trunks in a simple and physically redundant topology.","Furthermore, all fabric spine planes in the BDFs are identical clones by design, and cabling is localized within each independent spine plane. Port layouts are visual and repetitive, and all port maps are automatically generated and validated by our software.","All this makes fabric deployment and cabling a smooth, efficient, and virtually error-free job and is a great example of how networking requirements can positively influence building design. In the end, the amount of time for site network turn-up in Altoona – from concrete floor to bits flowing through switches – was greatly reduced.","Automation","A large fabric network – which has a more complex topology and a greater number of devices and interconnects – is definitely not the kind of environment that can be realistically configured and operated in a manual way. But the uniformity of the topology helps enable better programmability, and we can use software-based approaches to introduce more automation and more modularity to the network.","To automate the fabric, we’ve adjusted our thinking to be more “top down” – holistic network logic first, then individual devices and components second – abstracting from individual platform specifics and operating with large numbers of similar components at once. We’ve made our tools capable of dealing with different fabric topologies and form factors, creating a modular solution that can adapt to different-size data centers.","Also important was the disaggregation of hardware and automation – the fabric’s forwarding plane is actually independent of our tooling and vice versa. This allows us to replace any specific components without principal changes to software, and makes a broader range of hardware platforms compatible with our tools. Configuration work happens at the fabric level – as opposed to the device level – using the minimum number of high-level settings needed to define the network, its building blocks, and routing logic. All specific addresses, routing policies, port maps, and vendor-agnostic component parameters are derived from these high-level settings, rendered into applicable platform-specific forms, and pushed to the boxes. For each individual platform, we only need to define a few simple actions and basic syntax templates.","To expedite provisioning and changes, we’ve established simple and robust mechanisms to automatically deploy configurations on the devices and discover any new devices’ roles in the fabric. This allows us to efficiently deploy large sets of fabric components in parallel, in a virtually unattended mode.","The sheer scale of the fabric is also fundamentally changing how we monitor and troubleshoot. There are lots of components and links, but most of them behave the same. We collect a wealth of statistics from the network, but for troubleshooting we worry mainly about the baselines and outliers and rely more on active auditing for problems, priority-driven alerting, and auto-remediation, as opposed to staring at graphs. For every type of component we define automatic rules and push-button actions to gracefully take it out or service or put it back in production. Individual components in a fabric are virtually unimportant, and things that hard-fail don’t require immediate fixing. The overall behavior is much more important than an individual box or link, which is a paradigm shift.","Here’s what this means in practice:","When an auto-discovered issue is basic and known, we auto-remediate and/or alert.","When something unknown happens, we alert to fix it and then make it something that our robots can fix the next time it occurs.","When a fault is detected, machines route around.","When we need to isolate a problem, we compare behaviors and correlate events.","When we need a quick high-level assessment, we use heat maps.","When we need to drill down or trend, all data is at our disposal.","Transparent transition","As mentioned earlier, the concept of “cluster” was originally born from a networking limitation. But it has since evolved into a much broader meaning as a deployment and capacity unit. Many other systems and workflows have been designed around this concept, across multiple different technical disciplines. From early on, we realized that the whole world couldn’t be revamped overnight. We needed to make sure that all our systems and operations continued to run smoothly, despite the different network underneath.","To make the transition to fabric seamless and allow for backward compatibility, we preserved the logical concept of the “cluster” but we now implement it as a collection of pods. From the networking point of view, a cluster has become just a virtual “named area” on the fabric, and physically the pods that form a cluster can be located anywhere on the data center floor. But for all other purposes, the naming and addressing properties in such “virtual clusters” are fully compatible with our running physical cluster park, making them look and feel exactly the same for non-networking teams and server management automation systems.","The fabric introduced new flexibility to locate compute resources of “virtual clusters” in different areas of the data center – wherever free pods are available. There is no longer a need to keep clusters confined to specific contiguous physical spaces, and the new cluster sizes can be as large as the whole building or as small as a pod. But we didn’t force an immediate need for large operational changes – we just made it possible to take advantage of these new benefits as needed.","As a result, we were able to roll out completely new network architecture in production without disruption. There was one notable difference: The fabric was actually deployed faster and easier than the equivalent amount of clusters would have been.","Conclusion","In dealing with some of the largest-scale networks in the world, the Facebook network engineering team has learned to embrace the “keep it simple, stupid” principle. By nature, the systems we are working with can be large and complex, but we strive to keep their components as basic and robust as possible, and we reduce the operational complexity through design and automation.","Our new fabric was not an exception to this approach. Despite the large scale and complex-looking topology, it is a very modular system, with lots of repetitive elements. It’s easy to automate and deploy, and it’s simpler to operate than a smaller collection of customized clusters.","Fabric offers a multitude of equal paths between any points on the network, making individual circuits and devices unimportant – such a network is able to survive multiple simultaneous component failures with no impact. Smaller and simpler devices mean easier troubleshooting. The automation that fabric required us to create and improve made it faster to deploy than our previous data center networks, despite the increased number of boxes and links.","Our modular design and component sizing allow us to use the same mid-size switch hardware platforms for all roles in the network – fabric switches, spine switches, and edges – making them simple “Lego-style” building blocks that we can procure from multiple sources.","With smaller device port densities and minimized FIB and control plane needs, what’s started as our first all-around 40G network today will be quickly upgradable to 100G and beyond in the not so distant future, while leveraging the same infrastructure and fiber plant. With the first iteration of the fabric in our Altoona data center, we already achieved a 10x increase in the intra-building network capacity, compared with the equivalent cluster design, and we can easily grow to over 50x within the same port speeds."],"isopubdate":"2018-06-27"}

It’s time for new laws, starting with a new UK version of the Honest Ads Act proposed in Congress, so voters finally learn who is targeting them with what “news” – and who’s writing the cheques. And that’s the amendment I’ll propose to the data protection bill this week.","It’s not just the revelations about Cambridge Analytica that require us to act. The savagery in Salisbury brings with it a new truth. “Hybrid war”, fought for five years without mercy in the Ukraine, Crimea and the Baltics, has now arrived on our shores.","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","The definition of “hybrid war” is still moot. But scholars agree it entails damaging your enemy in ways that can be denied, with tactics as diverse as fielding troops without uniforms or launching crippling cyber attacks. The challenge is that this new battlefield is a rule-free zone. There’s no concept of “just war” to spell out when a response to an attack is legal. There are no Geneva conventions to define what is permissible behaviour.","Social media giants enjoy a legal privilege that lets them operate as platforms, not publishers","But what is perhaps clearis that Russia’s hybrid battleplan doesn’t simply aspire to murder; it takes aim at the messiness of our digital democracy and seeks to divide us by stirring up as much hate speech on either side of an argument as possible. That’s why new rules for firms such as Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are so important. They enable this sort of foreign intervention to unfold. They are the critical links in what has become a tried and tested “dark social” playbook that is deployed with extraordinary effect.","First, we have the hackers, groups such as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear, who were possibly among the teams leading the attacks on the Democratic National Committee during the US elections. They work in partnership with “useful idiots” like WikiLeaks, who were quite prepared to publish hacked material wholesale. Second, we have what’s most politely labelled the “alternative news platforms”, who publish to provoke a row. Once a row is up and running, the propagandists go to work on Twitter. Think of the misrepresented picture of a hijab-wearing lady on London Bridge during the terror attacks.","Once the ball is rolling, the troll farms go to work. We now know the importance of Twitter trolls and the organisations who run them such as the Kremlin’s Internet Research Agency. Russian “Twitter bots” or “active amplifiers” went into overdrive to spread anti-Macron and pro-Le Pen messages during the French election and these bots then shifted focus during September 2017 to attack Chancellor Angela Merkel and support far-right German candidates.","A building believed to be an Internet Research Agency ‘troll factory’ in Saint Petersburg. Photograph: Mstyslav Chernov/AP","Fourth, inflammatory material is imported into private groups on Facebook, where it spreads with dizzying speed – and force. Of course we simply do not know the size of this impact. Why not? Because Facebook won’t tell us. Despite making nearly $4bn a quarter in profits, it claims it can’t track down problematic accounts.","Fifth, we now know there is a risk of foreign money being used to fund “dark social ads” with incredible reach on the internet. This tactic leverages an unholy alliance with extreme groups on the left and right. Its aim is to polarise and divide. If we look at the 45 new parties that have been created in Europe over the past 10 to 20 years, we see a clear majority that have some sympathy with Russia. They include Germany’s AFD, Austria’s FPO, the Golden Dawn in Greece, Jobbik in Hungary, the Front National in France, the Northern League in Italy and, indeed, Ukip. The Front National took huge secret loans from Kremlin-backed banks. Nigel Farage famously said that Vladimir Putin was the leader he most admired.","Today, our legislation, agencies and national strategy are not fit for purpose. Social media giants enjoy a legal privilege invented before they were born, which lets them operate as platforms, not publishers. That means Facebook, YouTube or Twitter can avoidliabilities that newspapers face if they became message carriers for hate speech or death threats. The Electoral Commission is powerless to police foreign interference. The Advertising Standards Authority is reluctant to regulate political advertising: it has the power to ban political adverts from broadcast but not from targeted social media campaigns.","The lunacy of our current position is summarised by a simple fact. The US Congress currently has more power to investigate and act on this threat than we have here in this country. Section 256 of the Sanctions Act 2017 requires Congress to seek from the president an annual report into Russian interference into the elections and referendums of US allies such as our good selves.","This week, Labour will take steps to bring our laws into the era of hybrid warfare, with amendments to the data protection bill that set a deadline for updating the eCommerce directive. We would also, crucially, equip the Electoral Commission with powers to serve a “targeted disclosure notice”, which can be served on anyone suspected of trying to influence an election – or indeed a referendum – to set out what they’re spending where, and who they are targeting. It’s a British version of the American idea for an Honest Ads Act, requiring disclosure of who is spending what online, in pursuit of the basic right of voters to be fully informed.","Ultimately, as in any battle, our values and traditions are at stake. Our democracy and our traditions of free speech are priceless. Let’s make sure we’ve got the laws to defend them."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Its unusually long list of permissions, none of which you can opt out of, does include some items that make sense. Facebook wants its users to share photos, so the app requests access to the camera on your phone, allowing you to take pictures in-app. Many users check in to locations like restaurants or museums, and the app retrieves your location to tag your posts. Other permissions, however, are more difficult to understand. Why does the app need access to your browser history and how you use other apps? Or the names of wifi routers your phone connects to? And what about other people’s information, like telephone numbers and email addresses stored in your contacts?","None of your business","A common view is that you deserve what you consent to: users share data with companies like Facebook because they have explicitly agreed to this, in return for the right to use social media services. However, Austrian lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems is suing Facebook for breaching European data protection law. In multiple areas, Facebook is alleged to be collecting information that it has no right to under European legislation, and keeping and processing information beyond what users can agree to. When the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force at the end of May this year, his new NGO, noyb (“None of Your Business”), will to use it to strengthen its lawsuit against Facebook Ireland, where all of Facebook’s operations outside the US and Canada are headquartered. Users who live outside the US or Canada have a user agreement with Facebook Ireland, not with Facebook’s Silicon Valley offices.","Schrems started his legal battles in 2011, when he filed 22 complaints against Facebook with the body responsible for regulating Facebook Ireland’s operations, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. Using a 1,400-page document that Schrems obtained about himself from Facebook, he complained that the company was storing information that users believed they had permanently deleted from their accounts. This included deleted pokes, posts, messages, tags and photos. Schrems argued that the practice was in breach of the European Data Protection Directive (the forerunner to the upcoming GDPR) and that the company had no legitimate right to keep hold of this data. After complaints to the Irish Data Commissioner were rebuffed, Schrems filed a class action lawsuit in his home country of Austria, representing 250,000 other European Facebook users. In January 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that he could not bring a class action suit, but could still sue Facebook as an individual consumer, which he will do once the GDPR comes into force in May.","Shadow profiles","The most serious of Schrems’ allegations involve purported behind-the-scenes behaviour at the world’s largest social media company. This includes building “shadow profiles” beyond users’ profile pages. Schrems alleges that Facebook is “using data provided by the users themselves (e.g. status messages or uploaded photos) as well as data of other users (e.g. synchronisation of telephone directories, searches for current cities or friends with other users), additionally buying data from third parties (e.g. data vendors), importing public information (e.g. from Wikipedia) and collecting data itself (e.g. by analysing clicks, meta-data or search requests or tracking data).” This mass of information helps Facebook target advertising more effectively, making it a popular choice for marketers. As well as collecting information about users, the company also collects information about non-users.","To return to the Facebook mobile app, Facebook can access phone numbers stored on a phone. If the telephone number of a non-user is retrieved from a number of their friends who have downloaded the app, there is little to stop Facebook from reconstructing the non-user’s social circle and information about their social life. Since the original complaint filed in 2011, Facebook has updated its Data Use Policy to be more explicit about the information it collects. However, Schrems remains unsatisfied, writing on his website that, “they did not stop their illegal forms of data processing but simply wrote them into the policy, which made the new policy worse than the old one”.","Jump to 2018 and concern over shadow profiling is growing with the development of machine learning. Machine learning takes technology a step beyond programmers merely telling computers what to do. Algorithms can now tweak themselves to become more successful at performing given tasks. This might be more efficient, but in searching for patterns, machine learning can infer personal details about users that they never intended to share. Controversial research claims that machine learning algorithms are relatively successful at using photographic information to determine whether a person is homosexual or heterosexual. Facebook has already started using artificial intelligence to search through posts to identify suicidal users, looking for comments like, “are you ok?”, so that they can alert first responders to a potential emergency. While Facebook claims that the technology can help save lives, it is also eerily reminiscent of the 2017 film The Circle, in which a social media company intrudes further into its users’ private lives in the pursuit of a safer, more transparent world. The suicide alert technology is currently being rolled out worldwide, with the exception of Europe, which Facebook claims is because of local sensitivity to data protection issues, if not the GDPR itself.","Legal battles in Europe","Facebook has good reason to tread carefully in Europe. In 2015, Max Schrems scored a major victory by getting the European Court of Justice to strike down the “Safe Harbor” data sharing agreement between the EU and the US. After the former US government contractor Edward Snowden exposed PRISM, a programme that allowed the National Security Agency to read private communications between social media users, Schrems swiftly filed new complaints against Facebook, Apple, Skype, Microsoft and Yahoo Germany. Ultimately, the Court of Justice of the European Union decided that American companies could not adequately protect EU citizens’ data on US servers because of the NSA’s PRISM programme, invalidating the “Safe Harbor”. Furthermore, while Max Schrems waits for the GDPR to come into force to sue Facebook, the company faced defeat in Belgian and German courts in the same week in February. A Berlin regional court ruled that Facebook users cannot give informed consent because they cannot agree to five default settings that intrude on their privacy. It also ruled that Facebook’s terms about data collection are too broadly framed, and that the real name policy (in which users have to use their real names) is illegal. A few days later, a Belgian court found that Facebook’s tracking of users on third party sites with cookies is illegal, ruling that the social media platform must delete the data.","Facebook’s alleged privacy violations touch on major political questions about the digital landscape. As the internet has emerged as a major dimension of the world economy, data has become a valuable resource. While resources like water and fuel are mined from the natural environment, user data comes from people, and not all of it is obtained with their informed consent. Although Facebook claims that user data belongs to its users, its maximalist approach to data collection, processing and storage is testing the limits of the law and consumer rights. To complicate matters, social media has come to dominate public life and socialising in many countries, while in turn being dominated by a closed circle of tech giants. This gives consumers limited choice and little consumer power when they want to participate digital life.","While users may legally consent to Facebook’s terms, this does not mean that they are happy with them or felt free in their choice. Social media companies operate an uncompetitive market by building walled gardens. For example, while email is open between different providers, allowing a Yahoo email user to email a Hotmail account, a Google Plus user cannot connect with a Facebook user, forcing users to gravitate to where all the other users are. The law and citizens’ rights should protect consumers from overwhelming market power wielded by social media and tech companies. However, the epic legal battle against Facebook demonstrates that the rights enshrined in law are not a given, especially if regulatory bodies and lawmakers are not able or willing to defend them."],"isopubdate":"2040-11-01"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Within hours of being published, the explosive reports had already prompted at least one state attorney general to launch an investigation into the allegedly fraudulent practices.","But Trump, whose campaign paid Cambridge Analytica nearly $6 million for its work, has not said a word about the massive scandal engulfing the data company that the campaign once touted as integral to Trump’s victory.","His silence on the matter raises a host of startling questions, particularly given that he has already started making moves to organize his re-election campaign — and until he says otherwise, it’s reasonable to wonder if he plans to rely on the firm again.","The Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016. Jared Kushner, who was in charge of overseeing then-candidate Trump’s digital operations, brought the data firm into the campaign — a decision that was reportedly cheered on by Steve Bannon, a former vice president of Cambridge Analytica.","The data firm, which has always been shrouded in secrecy, later came under scrutiny amid a number of alarming revelations, including a report that Cambridge Analytica’s CEO had reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in an effort to obtain Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails.","In another instance, Cambridge Analytica reportedly offered to help WikiLeaks organize emails that had been hacked from the DNC and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta to make them more accessible to readers.","Amid all of these revelations, Trump has remained silent. While his campaign has quietly tried to distance itself from the data firm, no one has given any indication that they have a problem with the allegedly fraudulent — and potentially illegal — practices that were used to help Trump win the presidency.","And if Trump doesn’t see a problem with the company’s practices, there’s no reason to believe that he won’t use them again in 2020 — that is, if special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation doesn’t put an end to them first.","Shareblue Media is an American media company.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

But the fallout from the revelations extends far and wide beyond US borders.","The EU will investigate whether the privacy rights of European citizens have been violated by social media companies that may have shared their data illegally, said President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani on Monday.","\"Allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens' privacy rights,\" said Tajani on Twitter.","Tajani's comments follow three days of news reports about the activities of Cambridge Analytica, a UK-based company best known for working on President Trump's 2016 election campaign. The company took advantage of data harvested from Facebook accounts in order to build psychological profiles of voters that they could then target with ads, according to reports by The New York Times and Guardian.","According to former Cambridge Analytica employee-turned-whistleblower Chris Wylie, a University of Cambridge researcher named Aleksandr Kogan harvested the data through a personality quiz developed by his own company General Science Research (GSR), Facebook said. GSR extracted data about Facebook users who took part in the quiz -- as well as data about their friends -- and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica. GSR paid around 270,000 people to take the quiz, but in doing so managed to access the profile information of over 50 million Facebook users, the Times reported.","Facebook changed the rules about app developers being able to access the data belonging to users' friends in 2015. Prior to this, developers would have been able to harvest this data legitimately, meaning that profile information belonging to EU citizens could have been scooped up along with data belonging to their US Facebook friends.","The EU has much stricter privacy and data protection laws than the US, and they are about to get even stricter with the introduction of the Europe-wide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) this May. European privacy laws apply to all companies operating within Europe, no matter where they are based, giving US social media companies a strict set of rules to abide by. Even under current laws, misuse of citizen data can result in massive fines for the companies responsible.","Along with the European Parliament, EU Justice Commissioner Věra Jourová‏ also said she would be seeking to discuss the reports with Facebook when she visits the US government this week.","Meanwhile, in the UK...","In the UK, Cambridge Analytica is already the subject of two ongoing investigations by authorities -- one by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the country's data regulator, and another by the Electoral Commissioner, which is concerned about the role the company may have played in the 2016 Brexit campaign.","\"A full understanding of the facts, data flows and data uses is imperative for my ongoing investigation,\" said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham in a statement on Monday. \"This includes any new information, statements or evidence that have come to light in recent days.","Cambridge Analytica has also already been questioned as part of a wider Parliamentary investigation into fake news in the UK. The company's CEO, Alexander Nix, told members of Parliament last month that Cambridge Analytica had not received any data from GSR.","\"From the evidence that has been published by The Guardian and The Observer this weekend, it seems clear that he has deliberately misled the Committee and Parliament by giving false statements,\" said Committee Chair Damian Collins in a statement on Sunday. He will contact Nix this week asking him to explain his previous comments and answer further questions, he said.","Collins also accused Facebook both of deliberately avoiding answering questions about Cambridge Analytica and of understating the risk of data being taken and used without users' understanding and consent. Facebook previously provided evidence to the committee at a session in Washington DC in February, but Collins now wants CEO Mark Zuckerberg or another senior executive to answer for the company.","\"It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,\" said Collins. \"We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth.","\"Someone has to take responsibility for this,\" he added. \"It's time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.\"","Collins is also inviting whistleblower Chris Wylie to appear in front of the committee.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.","The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.","Blockchain Decoded: CNET looks at the tech powering bitcoin -- and soon, too, a myriad of services that will change your life."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}
{"originalurl":"https://balkin.blogspot.com/2018/03/mark-zuckerberg-announces-that-facebook.html","title":"Balkinization: Mark Zuckerberg Announces that Facebook is an Information Fiduciary","text":["Of course, Zuckerberg didn't actually use the words \"information fiduciary.\" But he did say two things that are effectively equivalent to it.","First, he said:","We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again.","In other words, because Facebook holds so much data about people, and because its operations are not transparent, people are vulnerable to how Facebook uses their data. This means that people must trust Facebook not to abuse their confidence. Facebook's right to hold the data depends on its responsibilities not to use abuse that trust. This is, in essence, the assumption of a fiduciary duty-- the duty not to abuse the trust that vulnerable parties must place in another who performs services for them.","Examples in the pre-digital age are the duties of professionals like lawyers and doctors-- they hold sensitive personal information about their clients in order to perform services for those clients. Their clients must trust them in order so that professionals can perform these services, and hence professionals take on a duty of good faith, trustworthiness, and non-manipulation. In the same way, Facebook provides a service-- a social network-- that many people find especially valuable. In the course of providing that service, people provide enormous amounts of data about themselves, making them (and their friends and loved ones) ever more vulnerable to Facebook. By providing that service, Facebook takes on the responsibility not to take advantage of their vulnerability. It has a duty not to abuse their trust, and as Zuckerberg says, if the company abuses their trust, \"we don't deserve to serve you.\"","Note that Zuckerberg does not ground this duty on the specific terms of Facebook's privacy policy-- a complicated contract that few people have actually read. If the duty of trustworthiness were based wholly on the terms of the contract, then if Facebook changed the privacy policy, the duty to protect its end-users would magically vanish.","Rather, Zuckerberg argues out that from 2007 onward, Facebook has changed its policies in order better to protect its end-users from abuse and manipulation. Whether this is in fact a correct account of Facebook's policies I leave to one side. The important point is that he is representing to the world at large that Facebook's aim is more than simply living up to whatever its vaguely worded privacy policy (i.e., its contract with end-users) happens to say. Rather, he argues that Facebook has a duty of trustworthiness and good faith that transcends the specific words of the privacy policy. This is a the duty of an information fiduciary.","This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.","In other words, Zuckerberg argued that Facebook had a duty to protect its end-users from abuse, not merely from its own actions, but also from the actions of those with whom it shares data. My view is that Facebook's fiduciary obligations \"run with the data,\" so that Facebook has a duty to make sure that whenever it allows another person or business to see, view, or employ Facebook's end-users' data, these persons and businesses must take on the same duties of trust and non-manipulation that Facebook itself must take on.","It is important to emphasize what I am not saying. I am not saying that Facebook has now agreed to whatever legal rules come with the concept of \"information fiduciary.\" Those rules and obligations need to be worked out over time. (In particular, see this Atlantic article that I wrote with Jonathan Zittrain of Harvard Law School, which lays out a basic proposal.)","Nor I am saying that Facebook has essentially confessed judgment to a host of lawsuits based on breach of confidence or breach of fiduciary duty. I am quite sure that Facebook's lawyers would deny that Zuckerberg has done this.","What I am saying is that this is an important moment in the development of legal and ethical norms for the Algorithmic Society. The founder of one of the largest and most powerful companies in the digital age has said (1) we have a duty of trust toward our end users; (2) we breached that trust; and (3) we breached that trust by allowing a third party we deal with to manipulate and abuse our end-users' trust in us.","This is the acknowledgement of a new category of businesses for the digital age. I call it an information fiduciary."],"isopubdate":""}

We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”","Part of the investigation will be to see if they violated Privacy Shield, a compliance program across the US and Europe for handling user privacy and data. It’s possible that an investigation could lead to enforcement action and fines for Facebook. A representative for FTC told BuzzFeed News the agency had no additional comment on the investigation.","This isn’t the first time Facebook has been dinged by the FTC over user privacy. In 2011, Facebook and the FTC reached a settlement over charges that it deceived its users in a variety of ways, including: sharing posts that were marked “Friends Only” with third-party apps, storing data after users deleted their accounts, and sharing user data with advertisers after promising it wouldn’t. As part of the settlement, Facebook had to agree to several measures of transparency about user privacy, including \"giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtaining their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings,\" preventing anyone from accessing data from deleted accounts, and getting a third-party privacy checkup every two years.","The user data taken by a researcher through a quiz app that was later sold to Cambridge Analytica happened in 2014, years after the FTC settlement. \"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,\" according to a statement in Monday's FTC release.","Here is the full statement by Tom Pahl, acting director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection:","The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers.

Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements.

But, for those who haven’t considered what happens when we hit ‘like’ or respond to a friend or search for an item to buy, it has come as a bit of a shock that our data is stored and organised and ads are sold on the basis of our activities. And, as we are learning now from reports into UK firm Cambridge Analytica, every time we approve an app on Facebook and fill out a daft questionnaire to find out what kind of chocolate bar we are or who we are going to marry from our friends list, all that rich data is leaving Facebook and going to external companies to analyse and sell, too.","It may be the first time a lot of people are thinking about the privacy of their data.

Perhaps we sell handmade jewellery on Etsy or sell marketing services to small businesses; Facebook offers free and paid opportunities for sharing what we do with people who might want to buy our offerings.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

(Wired wrote an excellent story about it, worth reading.)","As he developed Cow Clicker, Bogost quickly discovered something: Facebook gave app developers a lot of data about users. He was able to get each user's unique Facebook ID (Zuckerberg's is\"4\", as it turns out); and without even him asking for it, Facebook sent him \"affiliation\" info about users' schools, workplaces, and other organizations they belonged to.","In essence, Facebook at that time outgassed info so readily that it was almost hard to avoid building profiles of people. But of course, it made it insanely easy for something like Cambridge Analytica to happen, as Bogost notes.","And of course, as he notes, a) there were oodles of people developing apps and games at that point for Facebook, and b) they probably all still have that data, as he does:","But because I stored the numerical identifiers for user affiliations, I still have them. Until 2016, I could use a database-query tool called FQL, Facebook Query Language, to retrieve the details of those networks, and correlate them back to my users. Had I wanted to, I could have recombined that information with other data and used it for retargeting.","Cow Clicker’s example is so modest, it might not even seem like a problem. What does it matter if a simple diversion has your Facebook ID, education, and work affiliations? Especially since its solo creator (that’s me) was too dumb or too lazy to exploit that data toward pernicious ends. But even if I hadn’t thought about it at the time, I could have done so years later, long after the cows vanished, and once Cow Clicker players forgot that they’d ever installed my app.","This is also why Zuckerberg’s response to the present controversy feels so toothless. Facebook has vowed to audit companies that have collected, shared, or sold large volumes of data in violation of its policy, but the company cannot close the Pandora’s box it opened a decade ago, when it first allowed external apps to collect Facebook user data. That information is now in the hands of thousands, maybe millions of people.","When pianist James Rhodes uploaded a recording of his own performance of a Bach composition to Facebook, it was immediately blocked thanks to a match with a recording that Sony had claimed copyright in; Facebook uses an automated filter of the sort that the EU voted to make mandatory for all content types and services […]","It’s been predicted for years without much proof to show for it, but new data from Pew Research finally serves the pudding: young people are leaving Facebook for good.

Trump signed two proclamations imposing charges on steel and aluminum imports earlier this month.

It says it has been doing so with users permission, but it’s not that simple.","People who explicitly “opted in” to allowing Facebook to harvest their cell phone data did so by agreeing to let the company import their phone contacts so they could use Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android phones — but it was not obvious to many users that they were agreeing to have their cell phone records logged when they agreed to import their contacts to use those apps on their Android phones.","The company defended itself by explaining that “people have to expressly agree to use” the opt-in feature for importing their contacts on Messenger or Facebook Lite to allow Facebook to collect the cell phone data, but Sunday’s statement is the first time the social media company actually spelled out that practice in clear terms for users.","“When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the statement reads. “For Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose ‘learn more’ or ‘not now’. On Facebook Lite, the options are to turn it on or ‘skip’. If you chose to turn this feature on, we will begin to continuously log this information, which can be downloaded at any time using the Download Your Information tool.”","This circumspect cell phone data harvesting came to light via Twitter as users began posting their personal records downloaded from Facebook, offering incontrovertible evidence the company had indeed been collecting the data.","Oh wow my deleted Facebook Zip file contains info on every single phone cellphone call and text I made for about a year- cool totally not creepy.","The social media juggernaut does say that people who no longer want to use this opt-in feature can disable it in settings, and it claims that doing so triggers all of the call and text histories that were previously logged to be deleted.","“If, at any point, you no longer wish to continuously upload this information, you can easily turn this feature off in your settings,” the statement says. “You can also turn off continuous call and text history logging while keeping contact uploading enabled.”","Facebook also said in its statement that users’ information “is securely stored and we do not sell this information to third parties,” but last week’s scandal involving U.K. political data firm Cambridge Analytica highlighted that the company has in fact been vulnerable to manipulation by the outside companies it voluntarily shares information with.","The company’s stock has dropped more than 14% in a little over a week since the news broke that Cambridge Analytica was improperly harvesting data via a third-party company that Facebook willingly gave user data to. Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized in a statement on the social platform, as well as in a full-page newspaper ad, but the fallout appears to be continuing as the #DeleteFacebook hashtag continues to trend on social media, and high-profile users like Elon Musk delete their company pages.","SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT","You May Like","Read More","Sign Up for Our Newsletters","Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know now on politics, health, money and more"],"isopubdate":""}

The security services and police are restricted in their surveillance of private citizens on the web by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. Around 130,000 people signed a petition against it, largely because of the provision requiring internet providers to keep for up to a year records of all the websites that their users visited. One campaigner described it as “one of the most extreme surveillance laws ever passed in a democracy”.","Yet the material collected in this way can only be accessed under a system of legal and political oversight: the Home Office might like more powers, but the European court of justice ruled in December 2016 that independent judicial authorisation was needed for the “general and indiscriminate retention” of personal data. All that fuss over a year’s worth of websites, when it turns out that Facebook has been storing all the contact details, the instant messages, and the phone calls of millions of its users for as long as 10 years without anyone outside the firm realising what their apparently innocuous consent implied.","It would not be fair to blame Facebook alone for this. The victims of this policy were only the people who used its Messenger app on Android phones, and Android is a Google product. Apple’s rival phones don’t permit such indiscriminate harvesting of information. Although Google made this harder for phones updated since 2012, Android phones are notoriously slow to have their software upgraded, and the ability was still there even with the most modern phones until October last year. The hapless user believed only that they were allowing Facebook to look through their contacts to make it easier to reach them. In this instance, it is hard to blame Facebook entirely for taking advantage of a feature that Google had deliberately built. Both firms had a vital interest in collecting as much information as possible about their users – and everyone whom their users knew, on or off the network – and helping marketers to use it. What was then advertised or sold with the help of this once private information, whether it was goods or politicians, was of rather less interest. “Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?”, as Tom Lehrer sang.","However the blame is distributed, the central fact remains that these private companies have been able to embark on a programme of data collection that no government outside China has been able to undertake. They have done so without any judicial oversight of the kind that is meant to bind democratic government. They must now be reined in and brought within the law just as governments are. That is a democratic imperative. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission is looking at Facebook’s privacy practices. What will the UK government do?"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

Under the settlement Facebook was required to obtain outside assessments every two years for the next 20 years to prove it had fixed the violations and hadn’t repeated them.","Consumer watchdog group the Electronic Privacy Information Center obtained Facebook’s initial 2012 initial compliance report and the first assessment prepared by the independent auditor in 2013 through an earlier FOIA request. EPIC also is seeking the 2015 and 2017 compliance reports and independent assessments, which would cover the period for the data transfers to Cambridge Analytica.","PricewaterhouseCoopers, the global accounting firm, was picked to be Facebook’s independent privacy auditor.","The PwC report is a specialized “attestation” engagement, a non-financial audit, that includes PwC’s opinion on Facebook’s privacy controls. In 2013, PwC said that the controls were, after Facebook’s fixes in response to the enforcement action, “operating with sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance to protect the privacy of covered information.”","Michael Corey, who leads PwC’s U.S. cybersecurity and privacy assurance practice did not respond to a request for comment sent via PwC’s website.","In this case, PwC conducted its assessment based on Generally Accepted Privacy Principles or GAPP, a voluntary standard developed by the AICPA, the accounting industry’s trade association.","Robert Gellman, a privacy consultant, told MarketWatch, said that the GAPP is out of date. “There’s nothing there about cloud computing. There’s not enough about international jurisdictional issues, artificial intelligence, or transborder data flows.”","The issue of third-party access, specifically by academic researchers who may sell or transfer data later, is not covered in depth as of 2013 based on what can be viewed in the portion of the report that is not redacted. PwC’s 2013 assessment says that it did examine Facebook’s policy regarding third-party developers: “Facebook discloses personal information to third-party developers only for the purposes in the notice and with the implicit or explicit consent of the individual.”","PwC makes it clear in the initial assessment report that Facebook is the one responsible for the assertions it will test. “Our responsibility is to express an opinion based on our examination.” That examination consists of reviewing, on a test basis, “evidence supporting the effectiveness of the Facebook Privacy Program” and “performing such other procedures as we considered necessary.","PwC makes it very clear it did not examine nor is it responsible for Facebook’s interpretation or compliance with information security or privacy-related laws, statutes or regulations or Facebook’s interpretation of those laws, regulation or voluntary frameworks.","Penalties for violating the FTC agreement can go as high as $40,000 per day per violation.","“We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously as we did in 2012 in a privacy case involving Google,” an FTC spokeswoman told MarketWatch.","A spokeswoman for Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.","Facebook’s deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, pinned the blame for the unauthorized access on Cambridge Analytica, which it suspended, as well as the academic researcher, Dr. Aleksandr Kogan.","Approximately 270,000 people willingly downloaded a personality prediction test. But that app also allowed Kogan to access information on all their friends who had privacy settings set to allow that, according to Facebook.","Grewal posted on the site that although Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time” he subsequently broke Facebook rules. “By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies,” wrote Grewal.","Grewal says that when Facebook learned of this violation in 2015, they removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from him and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed which Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie provided.","But Grewal also says that now Facebook has discovered that “contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted.”","Francine\nMcKenna","Francine McKenna is a MarketWatch reporter based in Washington, covering financial regulation and legislation from a transparency perspective.

But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

In what legal experts say may be a “watershed” case, a US citizen is using British laws to try to discover how he was profiled and potentially targeted by the Trump campaign.","David Carroll, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design in New York, has discovered a transatlantic legal mechanism that he hopes will give him access to information being sought by both the FBI and the Senate intelligence committee. In recent weeks, investigators looking at how people acting on behalf of Russia targeted American voters have focused on Trump’s data operation. But although the FBI obtained a court order against Facebook to make it disclose evidence, the exact way in which US citizens were profiled and targeted remains largely unknown.","But British data protection laws may provide some transparency on the company at the heart of Trump’s data operation – Cambridge Analytica – and how it created profiles of 240 million Americans. In January, Carroll discovered he – and a group of other citizens – had the right under UK law to ask for his personal data back from the company, and when it failed to supply it, he started filing pre-trial actions to sue the company under British law. The lawsuit is the result of a unique situation, according to Ravi Naik of Irvine Thanvi Natas, the British solicitor who is leading the case. It arose because although Cambridge Analytica is largely owned by Trump’s biggest donor, hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and though its vice-president at the time of the US election was Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the company was spun out of an older British military and elections contractor, SCL, with which it still shares staff, directors and a London office.","In the US, Americans have almost no rights over their data whatsoever","Ravi Naik","Naik says: “It’s this fascinating situation because when it became apparent that Cambridge Analytica had processed Americans’ data in Britain, it suddenly opened up this window of opportunity. In the US, Americans have almost no rights over their data whatsoever, but the data protection framework is set up in such a way that it doesn’t matter where people are: it matters where the data is processed.","“I’m a human rights practitioner and in the past most of my cases were national security issues, but increasingly it’s about data protection and the way people are affected by the misuse of their data. I see this as an issue affecting fundamental rights and it’s taking citizen activism to uncover what’s going on, to request data. I really hear echoes of the civil rights movement in people becoming more aware, more resistant and willing to fight.”","As an academic, Carroll had studied advertising, data and design, but he was still shocked when Cambridge Analytica eventually sent him a “profile” that it had created about him though not the data it was created from. “It was very strange and unsettling because they had given me ‘scores’ for different issues but I had no idea what they’d based this on.” The company scored him 3/10 on “Gun Rights Importance”, 7/10 on “National Security Importance” and “unlikely” to vote Republican.","“I was perplexed by it. I started thinking, ‘Have I had conversations about gun rights on Facebook? Where are they getting this from? And what are they doing with it?’” He reported the firm to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, which is investigating the use of data in political campaigning; he has also launched a CrowdJustice campaign and is appealing to the public to help him take the case as far as he can through the British courts.","It really is a David and Goliath fight and I think it will be the model for other citizens’ actions against other big corporations","Frank Pasquale, University of Maryland","“There are so many disturbing aspects to this. One of the things that really troubles me is how the company can buy anonymous data completely legally from all these different sources, but as soon as it attaches it to voter files, you are re-identified. It means that every privacy policy we have ignored in our use of technology is a broken promise. It would be one thing if this information stayed in the US, if it was an American company and it only did voter data stuff.”","But, he argues, “it’s not just a US company and it’s not just a civilian company”. Instead, he says, it has ties with the military through SCL – “and it doesn’t just do voter targeting”. Carroll has provided information to the Senate intelligence committee and believes that the disclosures mandated by a British court could provide evidence helpful to investigators.","Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland, author of The Black Box Society and a leading expert on big data and the law, called the case a “watershed moment”.","“It really is a David and Goliath fight and I think it will be the model for other citizens’ actions against other big corporations. I think we will look back and see it as a really significant case in terms of the future of algorithmic accountability and data protection. These issues are so critical and in the US there are only these incredible, lethargic data laws largely because of the incredible power of the lobbying industry.”","Big data’s power is terrifying. That could be good news for democracy | George Monbiot","Read more","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician who has created the firm PersonalData.IO to help people reclaim their data, and who helped Carroll with his quest, said it was important that people realised that there are tools they can use against big corporations.","“In the US election, the FBI has been trying to get information from the top down but this doesn’t help with regard to the French election or Brexit,” Dehaye said. “And we know we just cannot trust Facebook, even with good intent, to run our elections fairly. There are a few huge companies amassing vast amounts of data on vast amounts of people and there’s no democratic oversight.”","Pasquale said news that Facebook information had been used by Russian agents to target US citizens may prove to be a tipping point. “It shows this information has now been weaponised by a state actor. What we’re seeing is really a failure of the first order. Mark Zuckerberg wrote this 6,000-word letter about creating a global political community and yet we now know that Facebook was a platform for a devastating attack on the most robust democracy in the world.”"],"isopubdate":"2017-09-30"}

But even when you go through all the steps to wipe your account, the odds are high that Facebook still has deep caches of all your user data, which is can still use. Better than simply deleting your account is to replace all that data with nonsense, and if you’re savvy with code, you can do just that.","Kevin Matthew, a former systems administrator who owns a small web development company, shared a script he created that replaces existing Facebook posts with randomly-generated nonsense. With a little coding know-how, you could use this script to repeatedly mangle all your Facebook posts over a period of several months, to make the bulk of Facebook’s data on you virtually unusable (though it doesn’t do anything for the data that’s already been scraped by third-parties, like the kind Cambridge Analytica allegedly gained access to).","Matthew said his script is simply a proof of concept, because actually doing this may be in violation of Facebook’s terms of service (so use at your own risk).","Image: courtesy Kevin Matthew","“My background is as a systems administrator, I’ve been doing that for 20 years, and everyone has data retention policies and backups,” Matthew told me over the phone. “Facebook, with its infinite amount of resources, I can only begin to imagine how that data is being held and retained.”","Matthew’s script automatically opens Facebook posts to edit and replaced them with randomly-generated text. The idea is that if you ran the script 100s, or 1000s of times, over the course of several months, on all of your data, it would likely make it more difficult for Facebook’s algorithms to pull useful data it uses to build a profile of you, including your political leanings and sexual orientation.","“Every little bit of information contributes to that invisible profile that they’re building of everyone,” Matthew said. “If we can obfuscate it even a little bit, that at least puts the power back into your hands as an end user.”","Though so far he’s only done a proof of concept for posts, going forward Matthew said it would be possible to build similar scripts to “poison” the rest of your Facebook data, such as tracking which websites you visit by having a script visit thousands of random sites while you’re logged into your account. To make it more accessible for non-coders, it would also be possible to create a desktop-based app that would run all the scripts for the average user.","We don’t know how far back Facebook’s history of data on its users extends, how that data is stored and backed up, but this is one way to at least make an attempt at sticking it to the platform before you leave it forever.","Matthew told me his main goal, though, is to raise awareness and to draw attention to the fact that the US and Canada have virtually no “right to be forgotten” laws, something that would protect a users right to have their data purged if they want to leave a site.","“Maybe my script won’t make a huge impact on a global scale, but maybe it will get us talking about protecting our privacy,” Matthew said. “If I want my data to be purged, I should have the right to do that.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Martin even fought in the Court of Appeals to sue one former Trump University student for defamation.","And before the election, Martin tried to stop TheWashington Post and other media from obtaining copies of the Trump University’s “Playbooks,” arguing in court papers that unsealing the documents would expose confidential information to competitors.","“Simply put, Mr. Trump’s Presidential campaign does not justify giving the Post carte blanche to expose TU’s trade secrets,” Martin wrote in May 2016. She didn’t prevail, and the employee pamphlets were quickly publicized. (Those “Playbooks” helped Trump’s instructors con single parents and average Joes into paying up to $35,000—sometimes on their credit cards—for allegedly bogus real estate seminars.)","Martin has made several TV appearances defending her boss, too.","As Trump’s treatment of women became a campaign controversy, Martin spoke on CNN and Larry King’s Russian-backed TV program.","In one October 2016 CNN spot, Martin said Trump’s “grab ’em by the pussy” comments, unearthed through an Access Hollywood video, were “not really representative of who he is.”","She also brushed off claims by women coming forward to accuse the Republican nominee of sexual harassment and assault, saying, “in my experience in the past six years, that experience, nothing like this has come forward about Mr. Trump.”","“Look, I’m not going to attack or criticize the women,” Martin told anchor Erin Burnett. “But what I do know is, I believe Donald when he says that and I believe them because I know him and I know his character. And I’ve seen him around women. Thousands of women that have worked for him including myself and he’s treated us with nothing but respect and appropriately.","“And he’s always been someone who none of us would ever imagine he would do something like this,” she added. “It is just completely inconsistent with his character and our own personal experiences. So, because of that, I believe him when he says he didn’t do anything inappropriate with women.”","Now Martin, a 38-year-old Los Angeles attorney, apparently stepped in to obtain a gag order to stop porn star Stormy Daniels from spilling the details of her alleged 2006 romp and year-long platonic relationship with the future president.","As The Wall Street Journal revealed last week, Martin is listed on an arbitration document as counsel for Essential Consultants LLC—the Delaware LLC that Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, used to pay Daniels $130,000 in hush money.","Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, received the payout after signing a nondisclosure agreement days before the election. Last month, Cohen obtained a temporary restraining order through an arbitrator to block Daniels from speaking about her alleged affair with Trump, which took place months after his son Barron was born.","It’s unclear why Martin, a Trump Organization lawyer since 2010, is named as an attorney for the shadowy company used to pay off Daniels, particularly when Trump’s personal lawyer has insisted that “neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford.”","Martin emailed the Journal a statement claiming that she filed the arbitration papers “in her individual capacity” until a New York lawyer was approved to practice in California.","“The company has had no involvement in the matter,” the statement added.","She echoed this sentiment for CNN, stating she was working on behalf of Cohen’s attorney, Lawrence Rosen, not the Trump Organization. (Rosen did not return messages left by The Daily Beast.)","Martin works for the Trump Organization as vice president and assistant general counsel for litigation and employment. According to one Legal Week report, Trump directly hired Martin in Los Angeles in 2010.","She’s kept a lower profile than many of the more colorful dramatis personae in Trump’s orbit and is based in Los Angeles, far away from the White House and the nerve center of the Trump’s corporate headquarters in Manhattan.","In court filings, Martin’s mailing address is listed as the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.","One attorney, who’s faced off with Martin in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals over Trump University, described Martin as “professional.”","“In my dealings with her, I found her quite professional,” Eric Alan Isaacson, a San Diego litigator, told The Daily Beast. “She was not obnoxious or imposing in the way other Trump lawyers can be.”","Isaacson added, “I’ve seen quotations in the newspaper of Trump’s other lawyers, [like] Michael Cohen, and saying horrible things about how they’re going to destroy you and stuff. I don’t recall Jill doing anything like that.”","In 2011, Isaacson was representing Tarla Makaeff, who filed a class-action suit against Trump University and was countersued for defamation by Trump for $1 million. A U.S. District Court denied Makaeff’s motion to strike the counterclaim, so she appealed.","To Isaacson, Martin appeared to be answering to whatever Trump wanted, rather than calling the shots for him.","Martin did not respond to requests for comment from The Daily Beast asking to clarify her role in Essential Consultants or why a Trump Organization attorney was representing a company which Cohen insists he set up independently of Trump.","Cohen declined to comment. When a Daily Beast reporter said she had questions about Martin’s involvement, Cohen replied, “Then you should call Jill Martin, OK.”","Still, in a handful of interviews, Martin has given hints about her previous role in handling Trump’s litigation and how he liked to deal with delicate legal issues.","“He does work closely with his lawyers and he does work closely with his outside counsel,” Martin told Law.com in a June 2016 interview. Trump would be particularly hands-on, she said, when being sued personally. “He really does have a strong strategic mind and he oftentimes has suggestions for the lawyers that perhaps the lawyers wouldn’t think of that have proved to be really good strategy decisions.”","Martin has rarely spoken at length in public outside the confines of legal proceedings or short statements to the press. She said she didn’t work for the Trump 2016 campaign—or, according to Federal Election Commission records, donate to it—but in the heat of election news cycles led by bruising stories about the GOP candidate’s sexism, Martin surfaced as the female-friendly face of the Trump Organization.","When The New York Times magazine published a lengthy profile of Trump in May 2016 featuring interviews with dozens of women alleging the candidate had subjected them to unwanted sexual advances and harassment based on their appearance, Martin took to TV to push back against the Times’ characterization.","She told Larry King that Trump’s reputation as a womanizer was just an unwarranted hangover from his involvement in the modeling and pageant industries. “When he’s judging women in a pageant, it’s much different than what it’s like working for him in a strictly commercial business capacity,” Martin said.","On CNN, Martin praised her boss for giving her a chance to succeed both in her professional and family lives.","“That’s a very challenging thing as a female attorney,” Martin said. “And he’s let me do that without skipping a beat. I’ve seen him do it with many other women.”","She coupled her praise with a dark message for the Times.

Now Canadian whistleblower Christopher Wylie is speaking out about what he knows. 4:18","The Canadian whistleblower at the centre of an international scandal that allegedly helped the Trump campaign capitalize politically from private Facebook information got his start in politics with the Liberal Party of Canada.","But several senior Liberal officials from that time, about a decade ago, insist they have almost no recollection of then-teenager Christopher Wylie — if any at all.","The New York Times and The Observer of London have reported U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign hired a data-analytics company that harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users.","Cambridge Analytica, the company named by Wylie as being behind the massive leak, exploited private social media activity to help allow the Trump campaign to better target voters by profiling their behaviour and personalities ahead of the U.S. election, according to the reports. The firm connected with Trump's political adviser Steve Bannon, whom Wylie also met, the reports said.","'I do feel responsible'","Wylie, a 28-year-old from British Columbia, is the data scientist who spoke out about the controversy. He's also the man who helped found Cambridge Analytica.","\"It was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country, without their consent or awareness.\"","The reports provided many details about the whistleblower who in 2007 or 2008 landed his first political gig with the federal Liberals.","At age 17, he worked in the office of Canada's opposition leader, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stéphane Dion, said one of the reports. When he was 18 years old, the newspaper said he learned all about data while working for officials on former U.S. president Barack Obama's campaign team, and later introduced one director to the Liberals.","A senior source with the Liberal Party said Sunday that Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss staffing details.","However, former Liberal officials from that time said they either hadn't heard of Wylie — or they barely remembered him.","\"I vaguely recall him,\" wrote one former senior official in an email Sunday. \"I think that he was a summer intern.\"","Another former senior Liberal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he asked former colleagues Sunday and some people remembered Wylie. They say he was \"pretty junior\" and worked in the data strategy and communications space.","One former party official, however, said while they didn't know Wylie well, they remembered him as a \"big advocate of microtargeting.\"","Liberal Party insists it doesn't sell information","One of the newspaper reports said Wylie came up with the idea behind Cambridge Analytica at age 24.","The article also said Wylie was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia as a teen and left school at 16 years old without any qualifications. After working for the Liberals and Obama's campaign, the report said he taught himself to code at age 19 and later studied law at the London School of Economics.","The reports also said Cambridge Analytica played a major role in the referendum that led to Britain's vote to leave the European Union.","Another article published May 2017 by The Guardian quoted a source that connected Wylie to a web analytics company in Victoria, B.C., called AggregateIQ. The firm has come under scrutiny in Britain for its possible role in helping the Leave campaign win the Brexit referendum.","Asked about Wylie, Canada's Liberal Party said in a statement Sunday that protecting the information of Canadians it engages with is a \"foremost priority.\"","Christopher Wylie told CBC News that Cambridge Analytica targeted millions of Americans during the election campaign without their knowledge based on psychological profiles and surveys. (Lily Martin/CBC)","The party said it has a clear, stringent policy that protects individuals' private information. It also said its agreements with campaign partners also include strict requirements.","The party insists it doesn't sell information under any circumstances.","A spokeswoman for Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould said Sunday that social media platforms have a responsibility to help ensure citizens and the democratic processes are protected from \"threats like foreign interference, data breaches, hate speech, and misinformation.\"","\"While some social media platforms have begun to take initial steps to address these issues, it's clear that much more needs to be done,\" Jordan Owens wrote in an email.","Owens said the government would work with social media firms to ensure they respect and help preserve the integrity of Canada's democracy.","Facebook said in a weekend blog post that claims the harvesting of user information was a data breach are \"completely false.\"","The statement said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his Facebook app.","\"People knowingly gave their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" said the post by Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice-president and deputy general counsel.","External Links","Popular Now","Comments","To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

Because I know that they could have prevented it.’\nPhotograph: Robert Gumpert","Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.","Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.","Where's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds","Read more","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.","Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

In fact, more than 30 percent of NHS staff believe patient care would be affected negatively if healthcare professionals weren’t able to use WhatsApp or other consumer IM tools.","So what’s so bad about using consumer IM services professionally? Bitglass head of EMEA Eduard Meelhuysen says there are a number of issues.","\"As unsanctioned messaging platforms like Slack and WhatsApp spread, they enable rapid communication and file sharing. This obviates the need for conventional tools like email and causes IT to lose visibility and control over sensitive data,” says Meelhuysen.","“Moreover, in the battle between usability and security, usability tends to win.”","The report finds that thus far, attempts to stem the tide through education, the provision of alternatives and enforcement of policy are doing little to discourage staff with 1 in 50 receiving disciplinary actions for IM related incidents.","All of this findings no doubt leaves decision makers in a quandary – is it worth it ignore the dangers to data security in favour of the significant benefits that IM provides?","However, as adoption of such apps grows year-on-year (driven primarily by new entrants to the workforce), so too does the risk from accidental or malicious misuse.","Participants were able to recall a number of incidents that suggest consumer IM is a space for inappropriate communication and behaviours that are a detriment to confidentiality.","“The only solution is to sanction cloud apps with a strong security track record, and combine them with third-party tools to secure data in the cloud. Only then will the NHS be able to improve its ability to protect medical records, helping them focus on their core competency – delivering care services.\"","The report affirms a number of healthcare tech vendors are already in the process of developing systems designed to tackle the issues raised in the report, however, it recommends a coordinated approach to fully address the now culturally embedded reliance on consumer IM applications.","Inevitably, the report notes, if the status quo continues then there will be a pivotal event that will mean the NHS will either have to blame the individuals and take action against nearly half of the workforce, or bear the institutional responsibility for allowing such actions to persist.","The findings presented in the report are based on a survey of 823 NHS staff. This sample size (0.68 percent of the population) means that results can be presented with a confidence level of 95 percent and a 3.5 percent margin of error."],"isopubdate":""}

It was the late 1990s, and the political advertising operative had an idea about using a relatively newfangled tool – banner ads on web sites – to promote political candidates. “It was pretty clear to me at the time that the ability to target and tailor messaging was perfect for political campaigns,” Gould recalled recently. “I did a whole presentation on the internet and the power to connect, track, do fundraising, target.”","But when Gould finished his pitches, he would be met with blank stares. “I was a very lonely pied piper,” he says.","Finally, in 1998, Gould found a political candidate who was so far behind in the polls, and so strapped for cash, that he was willing to take a risk and spend $100,000 on banner ads on the New York Times homepage. Peter Vallone, then a New York City council member challenging George Pataki for the governorship, gave Gould the green light for an ad buy that has since entered the history books as the first significant use of online advertising in a political campaign.","The ads themselves are lost to internet history – Gould believes he may have copies somewhere on floppy discs. But it’s not hard to draw a line from that moment to Robert Mueller’s 16 February indictment of the Internet Research Agency, which alleges that Russian agents carried out a conspiracy to interfere with a US presidential election, in large part by purchasing targeted Facebook ads designed to “encourage US minority groups not to vote”.Or to the news recently revealed in the Observer that 50m Facebook profiles were obtained and misused by data mining company Cambridge Analytica to target voters during the 2016 presidential election.","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","The Vallone ads contained rudimentary versions of many of the attributes that make digital advertising such a powerful – and terrifying – force today: the ability to target specific audiences with tailored messages, then track their reaction.","“Come November 2000, I expect the question will no longer be whether web-based political advertising works,” wrote Cyrus Krohn, then the manager of political advertising for the Microsoft Network, in a prescient 1999 column for Slate, “but whether it works too well.”","Nearly 20 years later, the world has caught up to Krohn’s concerns, with some critics making the not entirely hyperbolic argument that micro-targeted “dark advertising” on Facebook is a fundamental threat to democracy itself. Is it too late for democracy to fix itself?","Parscale had been a little-known digital marketing executive working out of Texas when he was tapped to build Trump’s campaign website in 2015. Until then, digital advertising was barely a rounding error in campaign budgets. In 2008, the year Barack Obama became the first social media candidate, candidates spent just $22.25m on online political ads, according to an analysis by Borrell Associates. That number grew significantly in 2012, but the real explosion came in 2016, when campaigns pumped $1.4bn into digital ads.","US presidential campaigns are often remembered – and understood – by their advertisements. Lyndon B Johnson’s “Daisy” ad powerfully (and controversially) set the stakes of an election in a nuclear world. George HW Bush’s “Willie Horton” attack ad still epitomizes the racist dog-whistle politics of the tough-on-crime era. The message, as much as the messenger, is a key part of the debate over who is best equipped to lead the country.","But no such public debate took place around Trump’s apparently game-changing digital political advertisements before election day.","This is partly due to a loophole in the prevailing campaign finance law, which was written in 2002 and did not include internet ads in the class of regulated “electioneering communications”. But perhaps even more important is the very nature of online advertising, which is self-serve (just sign up with a credit card and go) and highly iterative.","Parscale claims he typically ran 50,000 to 60,000 variations of Facebook ads each day during the Trump campaign, all targeting different segments of the electorate. Understanding the meaning of a single one of those ads would require knowing what the ad actually said, who the campaign targeted to see that ad, and how that audience responded. Multiply that by 100 and you have a headache; by 50,000 and you’ll start to doubt your grasp on reality. Then remember that this is 50,000 a day over the course of a campaign that lasted more than a year.","“The reason I said it might work too well,” Krohn said in a recent interview with the Guardian, “is that mass marketing went away and micro-targeting – nano-targeting – came to fruition.”","Any candidate using Facebook can put a campaign message promising one thing in front of one group of voters while simultaneously running an ad with a completely opposite message in front of a different group of voters. The ads themselves are not posted anywhere for the general public to see (this is what’s known as “dark advertising”), and chances are, no one will ever be the wiser.","Trump digital director says Facebook helped win the White House","Read more","That undermines the very idea of a “marketplace of ideas”, says Ann Ravel, a former member of the Federal Election Commission who has long advocated stricter regulations on digital campaigning. “The way to have a robust democracy is for people to hear all these ideas and make decisions and discuss,” Ravel said. “With microtargeting, that is not happening.”","Parscale and his staff told reporters with Bloomberg that they used Facebook ads to target Hillary Clinton supporters with messages designed to make them sit the election out, including her own forays into dog-whistle politics from the 1990s, which the Trump campaign hoped would discourage black voters from turning out to the polls.","That degree of political manipulation might be unsavory, but it’s also relatively old-fashioned. One digital campaign staffer (not affiliated with the Trump campaign) compared it to Richard Nixon’s Southern Strategy, only “technologically savvy”.","But new reporting by the Observer has revealed that the data analytics team that worked for Trump, Cambridge Analytica, went far beyond Nixonian dirty tricks. The firm obtained Facebook data harvested under the auspices of an academic study, the Observer has revealed, and then used that data to target millions of US voters based on their psychological weaknesses.","“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,” whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Observer about the data theft, “and built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.”","European elections","Political advertising in the US is the wild west compared with other western democracies, which tend to have shorter election campaigns with strict regulations on the amount and type of spending permitted. Such rules may enhance the impact of digital advertising, which is much cheaper than television and largely unregulated.","The UK has seen a rapid shift to digital campaigning following the Conservative party’s embrace of Facebook in the 2015 general election. The Tories outspent Labour by a factor of 10 on Facebook advertisements, a decision that many political observers saw as decisive. In a country that bans political ads on television, Facebook enabled the Conservatives to reach 80.65% of users in targeted constituencies with its promoted posts and video ads, according to marketing materials created by Facebook. (At some point in the past year, the company began hiding previously produced “Success Stories” about its ability to sway election results.)","The Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum went on to spend almost its entire budget on Facebook advertising, an investment that resulted in about 1bn targeted digital ads being served to voters over the course of a 10-week campaign.","Though it is impossible to parse the exact impact of Facebook advertisements amid all the other factors that shape an electoral result (including organic Facebook content), the platform is increasingly cited as a factor in the growing electoral might of far-right groups in Europe.","Supporters of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party demonstrate outside the Chancellery in Berlin last week. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images","The radical right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party reportedly worked with a US campaign consultancy and Facebook itself to target German voters susceptible to its anti-immigrant message during the 2017 election in which AfD surged in popularity to become the third-largest party in parliament.","Campaigning in Italy’s recent election, which saw the rise of anti-establishment parties, including the populist Five Star Movement and the far-right League, largely took place on social media. Facebook advertisements and targeting information gathered by Italian transparency group Openpolis found that the neo-fascist Brothers of Italy party ran a Facebook ad targeting Italian adults who are interested in the paramilitary police force, the carabinieri.","After the polls closed in Italy, the League’s Matteo Salvini shared some words of gratitude with the press: “Thank God for the internet. Thank God for social media. Thank God for Facebook.”","Targeting the midterms","While investigations into the 2016 US election and Brexit referendum continue, it’s worth remembering that more elections are fast approaching. Scores of countries will hold national elections in 2018, including Sweden, Ireland, Egypt, Mexico and Brazil.","In the US, candidates for the 435 congressional and 35 Senate seats that are up for grabs in November are already running campaigns on Facebook, and we may never know what they’re saying in those advertisements.","Take, for example, Paul Nehlen, a candidate who is running a Republican primary challenge against the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, in Wisconsin. Nehlen is primarily known as a vehement antisemite who was once embraced by Steve Bannon and the Breitbart wing of the right, but was excommunicated after appearing on a white supremacist podcast.","They’ve built this incredibly powerful platform that allows very narrow targeting ... so that scares me","Alan Mislove, professor","According to his FEC filings, Nehlen spent at least $2,791.72 on Facebook ads in the final six months of 2017.","What did that money buy?","In the first instance, everything that any Facebook advertiser can get: access to one of the most powerful databases of personal information that has ever existed, with insights into individuals’ intimate relationships, political beliefs, consumer habits and internet browsing.","Beyond that, we don’t know. Nehlen could be using Facebook to target likely voters in his district with a message about infrastructure. Or he could have taken a list of his own core supporters (he has more than 40,000 likes on Facebook), used Facebook’s “lookalike audience” tool to find other people inclined to support his particular politics, then fed them ads designed to persuade more people to join him in hating Jews.","Last fall, after Facebook had been forced to admit that, despite its initial denials, its platform had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the election, the company announced a set of reforms designed to assuage its critics – and stave off actual, enforceable regulation.","Starting this summer, the platform has promised that every political ad will be linked back to the page that paid for it. The pages themselves will display every ad that they’re running, as well as demographic information about the audience that they are reaching, a measure that Mark Zuckerberg claimed would “bring Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency” than the law requires for television or other media.","A version of these reforms is already live in Canada, where users can see all the ads being run by a political candidate in a designated tab on their page.","But there is good reason to be skeptical.","Since 2014, Facebook has had a transparency tool for all ads served on the platform. Click on the upper right-hand corner of a Facebook ad and you’ll see an option reading “Why am I seeing this ad?” Click through and you’ll get an explanation of the characteristics that make you desirable to the advertiser.","So far so good, but a new study by computer scientists found that Facebook’s ad explanations were “often incomplete and sometimes misleading” in a way that “may allow malicious advertisers to easily obfuscate ad explanations that are discriminatory or that target privacy-sensitive attributes”.","Alan Mislove, a professor of computer science at Northeastern University and one of the study’s co-authors, said that he gave Facebook credit for having the feature at all, noting that it is one of the only examples of a company offering any kind of explanation of how an algorithm actually works. But the findings do not paint a particularly pretty picture of Facebook’s ability to self-regulate.","“They’ve built this incredibly powerful platform that allows very narrow targeting, a very powerful tool that anyone on the internet can use, so that scares me,” Mislove said. “And up until very recently, there was very little accountability. You as a malicious actor on Facebook don’t even really need to obfuscate your behavior, because the only person watching is Facebook.”","Honest Ads Act","The best hope for bringing some order to the realm of digital political ads is through updating US law for the Facebook era.","A bipartisan proposal to do just that exists. In October, Senators Amy Klobuchar, Mark Warner and John McCain introduced the Honest Ads Act, which would close the loophole that allows internet ads to avoid regulation, and also require internet platforms (ie Facebook and Google) to maintain a public file of all the political ads they run and who paid for them.","But as much as we need transparency around political ads to maintain democracy, we also need a functioning democracy to get that transparency. And it’s not clear that it’s not already too late.","“In an ideal world, with a fully functioning Congress, there would be hearings around the Honest Ads Act, and you would have Facebook and Google and Twitter and experts testify to shine a light on the nature of political advertising,” said Brendan Fischer, director of FEC reform at the Campaign Legal Center. “We’re not close to that at all.”","In the absence of a fully functioning Congress, what is to be done? Should we expect Facebook to simply stop selling political ads?","Antonio Garcia Martinez, a former product manager for Facebook who helped develop its advertising toolssays that he has come to realize that political ads are simply a different beast than commercial ones, which can and should be treated differently by his former employer.","“Selling shoes needs to be different than selling politicians, even though the mechanics of it are identical,” he said. “Morally it’s different.”","Or should we pressure Facebook to stop allowing candidates with hateful or extremist views to use its tools?","“If we farm these important democratic responsibilities out to a private company, today they might be regulating antisemitism, but tomorrow they’re regulating what people can say about the Honest Ads Act,” Fischer said.","Indeed, Facebook could already be suppressing political views unfavorable to its business practices, and we would have no way of knowing. It’s possible Facebook wouldn’t even know. In response to queries about inconsistent moderation of clothing advertisements, a Facebook spokeswoman recently told the New York Times that “the company could not ask an automated system about [its] decisions”.","Frankenstein’s monster is not under any human’s control.","No one can pretend Facebook is just harmless fun any more | Ellie Mae O’Hagan","Read more","If this all seems positively dystopian, one person who is surprisingly sanguine is Alan Gould.","Gould left politics soon after the Vallone campaign, founded an advertising analytics firm, sold it, and is now a tech investor.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The tech-packed index closed 1.8% lower, with the Dow Jones industrial average, which doesn't include Facebook, off 1.4%.","The FAANG stocks have been driving the market higher, partly due to their strong sales and profit growth but also because the Nasdaq is a market-weighted index. That means the price moves of stocks with higher market values have a bigger impact on the index.

Mercer was also a major donor to Trump’s election campaign.","It was Bannon’s first public appearance and statement since the explosive reports by the Observer and the Guardian, sister publications, last weekend, that the personal data of about 50 million Americans had been harvested and improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.","The international data analytics operation, which worked with Trump’s election team, scraped millions of Facebook profiles of US voters and information about their social media friends, then used them for political propaganda.","It is one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and the data gleaned was used to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","The tech firm used personal information in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements, tech whistleblower and former employee Christopher Wylie told the Observer.","“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles.

Press reports on Saturday claimed it had harvested data from more than 50m profiles mostly belonging to US voters.","Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, showed documents to the New York Times, the UK’s The Observer and Channel 4 News, which the news outlets said detailed a programme that used data from a survey without users’ permission.","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the wild west,” said Mark Warner, vice-chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.","“Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","The Massachusetts attorney-general announced on Saturday afternoon that it would launch an investigation, arguing the state’s residents deserved answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","The UK information commissioner said ;it was investigating the way Facebook data could have been illegally obtained and used, as part of a probe into data analytics for political purposes.","The social network said on Friday that it would suspend Strategic Communications Laboratories, the parent group of Cambridge Analytica, and was prepared to take legal action if it discovered any unlawful behaviour.","In 2015, Facebook said it had learned that Dr Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, had passed data collected by a personality prediction app that ran on Facebook to Cambridge Analytica.","The “this is your digital life” app was billed as a research app used by psychologists. Some 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook login, and gave it consent to access data from their Facebook profiles including their city, the likes and information about their friends.","News reports suggest that the number of affected profiles was far larger, over 50m, with the New York Times reporting that 30m contained enough data to match users to other records and build psychographic profiles.","Facebook executives disputed reports that classified the incident as a data breach, because it was not hacked. Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer, also tweeted on Saturday that the company had made significant changes to how developers could access data in 2015, so users could not expose their friends’ data.","Facebook claims that Dr Kogan broke the company’s rules by passing it to third parties, Cambridge Analytica and Mr Wylie. When Facebook learned of the violation in 2015, it removed the app from Facebook and demanded assurances the data had been destroyed. But it did not publicly disclose the matter at the time.","Paul Grewal, vice-president and general counsel, wrote in a blog post on Friday that Facebook received reports in recent days that claim the data were not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information,” he wrote.","Cambridge Analytica said it did not use or hold Facebook data. It believed Dr Kogan’s company Global Science Research was complying with UK law. It said it later deleted all the data it had received from GSR and it was not used it in the work it did in the 2016 US presidential election.","“GSR was a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding the its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections. It would be entirely incorrect to attempt to claim that SCL Elections illegally acquired Facebook data,” the company wrote in a statement.","Ahead of a UK parliamentary hearing last month, Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, wrote to Damian Collins MP, saying the company did not use data from Facebook, including Facebook Likes, or any personality modelling.","Dr Kogan did not reply to request for comment. Mr Wylie could not be reached for comment.","Recommended","The political research firm has received significant attention for its data mining and building profiles to “micro target” voters. Cambridge Analytica has said it amassed more than 5,000 data points on the behavioural trends of US citizens and combined it with psychological surveys on Facebook.","David Carroll, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design in New York, is using UK data protection law to try to obtain his personal data from Cambridge Analytica. He said the revelations bolster his case, as they show how much more data the company may have on him. He said it was incumbent on Facebook “to come clean” about whether they adequately protected this data and ensured it was deleted.","“[The fact that] I’ve been able to pursue this case as far as I have suggests that Facebook could have done more. If I’m able to do all of this, as just one person, a normal citizen, why did Facebook not do so much more?” he said.","The UK watchdog said last year it was probing Cambridge Analytica and other data analytics companies to see whether Britons’ data protection rights were breached during the EU membership referendum.","The Financial Times once hired Cambridge Analytica for a market research project.","The ban comes as Facebook is trying to deal with the fallout from accusations that the platform was used to manipulate voter opinion by a Russian disinformation campaign and fake news during the US presidential election of 2016.","Facebook, like all tech companies with European users, is also preparing to comply with new privacy regulations coming into force in May. The General Data Protection Regulation carries fines of up to 4 per cent of global revenue for violations, which could include the use of personal data for political purposes without the users’ consent.","Copyright\nThe Financial Times Limited .

Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner, who confirmed their probes in December.","“The OIPC is investigating whether AggregateIQ is in compliance with the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA),” the office said in a statement, adding it can’t provide specific details on the “active” investigation.","“Our investigations generally result in findings and recommendations, but in some cases, we will issue a legally binding order. In terms of penalties, an organization that commits an offence under [PIPA] is liable to a fine of up to $100,000,” the statement concluded.","On March 6, U.K. information commissioner Elizabeth Denham told the British parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that a report on the investigation, which also looks at several other companies involved in swaying opinions during the Brexit referendum, is expected to be released by the end of May.","Denham was B.C.’s privacy commissioner before taking her post in the U.K.","AggregateIQ did not respond to requests for comment.","Who is Christopher Wylie?","Global News was unable to speak to Wylie, but an exhaustive profile in the Guardian sheds some light on his past in Canada.","Wylie, who describes himself as gay and a vegan, grew up in B.C., although where exactly he calls home is unknown.","At the age of six, he told the paper, he was abused by a mentally unstable person while at school, which led to a long court battle after the school attempted to cover up the incident.","As a teenager, he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, and was a victim of bullying. He successfully sued the B.C. Ministry of Education to get the province’s inclusion policies around bullying changed, eventually leaving school altogether at 16 without a single qualification.","But he was able to land a job with the federal Liberal Party a year later, eventually working in the office of then-party leader Stephane Dion, who was also the leader of the Opposition in Parliament.","It was there that he began to formulate strategies on how politicians could capitalize on data collected through social media — the same strategies that would form the basis of the operations conducted by Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ.","A former senior Liberal insider who spoke on condition of anonymity said Wylie pitched the idea to the office, which had since been taken over by Michael Ignatieff, but that the Liberals wanted nothing to do with it, calling his approach too invasive.","The source, who joined several other former co-workers and people who knew Wylie in describing him as “whip-smart,” said the idea played a significant part in Wylie losing his job in the office in 2009.","Several other senior Liberal officials who worked in the office during that time told The Canadian Press that they don’t remember Wylie, and those who did only had vague recollections of him working there.","“I vaguely recall him,” wrote one former senior official in an email on Sunday. “I think that he was a summer intern.”","Another former senior Liberal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he asked former colleagues on Sunday, and some people remembered Wylie.

The news that Facebook shared user data with a number of organisations including Cambridge Analytica seems to reflect the paradox of surveillance society — that our data is never safe, but share it we must.","So once again, in a Snowdenish moment, we are hit by the revelation that Cambridge Analytica conducted behavioural modeling and psychographic profiling (creating personality profiles by gauging motives, interests, attitudes, beliefs, values, etc) based on data it collected, to successfully (allegedly) target Americans prior to the recent presidential election.","Facebook collects all kinds of social data about its users, like their relationship status, place of work, colleagues, last time they visited their parents, songs they like listening to, as well as other kinds of information such as device data, websites visited from the platform, etc. This may be information that is shared by the user or what their friends may share about them on the platform.","That aside, let us not forget that Facebook has bought over WhatsApp and Instagram and can tap into data from those platforms as well, apart from the data it buys from data brokers!","Data that is collected is used to draw up the profile of users — a detailed picture of the persona that emerges by piecing together known activity and aptitude and generating predictions about possible proclivities and predispositions. The mechanics of big data thus recreate the sum total of user traits and attributes — without necessarily verifying them per user.","What follows then is the clustering of users into hyper segments with similar attributes for micro-targeting ads. You may merely be ‘liking’ an article on the last male white Rhino, but Facebook will use it to predict with a fair amount of accuracy your political affiliation and sexual orientation, using algorithmic modelling to nudge you to buy something you are most likely to. Hyper-segmentation based on social media profiling can also be used to create a consumer base for political messaging, as has been suggested in the case of Cambridge Analytica.","The target","Many digital corporations, including Uber, Twitter and Microsoft sell their data to third parties who build apps and provide services on top of it. With machine learning, the targeting of individuals assumes new dimensions; it becomes possible to do nano-targeting, zoom in precisely on one individual.","A fintech startup in India recently rejected an applicant because they could uncover that she had actually filed for a loan on behalf of her live-in partner who was unemployed. The boyfriend’s loan request had been rejected earlier. The start-up’s machine learning algorithm had used GPS and social media data — both of which the duo had given permissions for while downloading the app — to make the connection that they were in a relationship.","That big data can be put to use in ways that reinforce ‘social and cultural segregation and exclusion’ is fairly well accepted now. It is this slippery slope from micro-targeting to the social allocation by algorithms of opportunities and privileges that poses serious concerns. A ProPublica investigation from 2016 collected more than 52,000 unique attributes that Facebook used to classify users into micro target-able groups. It then went on to buy Facebook advertisement for housing that demonstrated how it was possible to exclude African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Americans. As Frank Pasquale notes, constitutionally inculcated rights and morality are slowly being undone “by the use of automated processes to assess risk and allocate opportunity”.","The public sphere","This brings us to the question of what the social role of digital intelligence means for the future of democracy. Elections play a vital role in a robust democracy. We seek to safeguard their free and fair nature through regulations that impose restrictions on exit polls or call out parties for unduly influencing voters through the distribution of freebies. Wouldn’t then, a nudging of voters through intimate knowledge of their behaviour be a threat to this socio-political hygiene we seek to maintain?","Can we allow the replacement of the will of the people by a market democracy in which the masses can be gamed? How should the Election Commission take due cognisance of and address such mass-scale manipulation?","Beyond electoral fairness, there are severe repercussions for the sanctity of the public sphere in the rapidly unfolding role of algorithms. When people know that online behaviour is monitored, they carefully moderate how they interact online, a phenomenon referred to as social cooling.","A man goes through the process of eye scanning for Unique Identification (UID) database system. Reuters","The collusion","The Cambridge Analytica episode bears a close resemblance to the Snowden disclosure of the unholy nexus of the state, private corporation, and uninhibited surveillance. India has already succeeded in building a ‘cradle to grave’ Panspectron by seeding citizens’ unique biometric identifier across databases. Aadhaar has allowed for an informationisation of life where “...the human body is reduced to a set of numbers that can be stored, retrieved and reconstituted across terminals, screens and interfaces”.","With the biometric, the body can never disassociate with its data and may be recalled, whenever convenient sans ‘the individual’. To add psychographic data akin to a ‘behavioural’ biometric to this mix is to give a ‘God’s eye view’ of society to the state, one that the state is bound to abuse to determine the human condition. For instance, China’s profoundly disturbing, Sesame Credit uses citizen data including data from everyday transactions, biometric data, etc, to dole out instant karma.","From the other end, corporations who already collect behavioural data are keen on accessing Aadhaar data, for this will allow them to trade data around a unique data point to attain, much like the state, a 360-degree view of their customers.","Facebook has faced criticism in the past for experimenting with users’ emotions, using unethical manipulation of information to influence the moods of users. The plausibility of nano-surveillance raises fundamental philosophical questions about society and human agency, calling attention to the urgent task of reining in the data capitalists.","The norm","While digital corporations claim to audit how third parties may use the data they have shared, monitoring is lax. India does have rules on data sharing; however, these pertain to a predefined list of data types. Traditionally, data protection legislation has focused on ‘personally identifiable information’(PII), but with technological advances — a la big data analysis and artificial intelligence, what is or is not PII is contested. The law, therefore, needs to be re-imagined to suit contemporary techniques of data analysis.","Besides the fact of unencumbered data sharing, that Facebook was able to collect such vast amounts and varied kinds of data is itself unsettling. To prevent the frightening prospect of future society being reduced to an aggregate of manipulated data points, it may well be necessary to determine that certain kinds of data will not be collected and certain types of data processing will not be done. Restrictions on collection and use can be sector specific, based on well debated social norms and constitutionally driven, much like how the Delhi High Court held on the grounds of the Right to Health that excluding genetic disorders from insurance policies is illegal.","It is time we moved from individual-centred notions of privacy where the ‘user’ is constantly asked to barter the right to privacy for entitlements, credits, and conveniences. Nandan Nilekani's exhortation that citizens be empowered to monetise the plentiful data they generate and get easier credit, better healthcare, better skills and welfare benefits is a recipe for a disempowered society left to the whims of neo-liberal market democracy. The social value of privacy needs to be spotlighted for it urges us to look not only at the individual right over data, but the social benefits that we derive from its recognition.","So far as societies are products of behavioural modelling, Zuckerberg’s apology does not really count.","The authors are with IT for Change, an NGO that works at the intersection of digital technologies and social justice"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Now. - The Washington Post","text":["Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg need to come clean about 2016. Now.","Over the weekend, the New York Times and the Observer of London posted a blockbuster investigative piece revealing that Cambridge Analytica, the firm brought on by the Trump campaign to target voters online, used the data of tens of millions of people obtained from Facebook without proper disclosures or permission.","In the wake of this report, it’s more than past time for Mark Zuckerberg to testify to Congress about Facebook’s role in the 2016 elections and why he believes existing privacy laws are adequate to protect Americans from misuse and abuse of technology platforms.","And I mean Mark Zuckerberg. Not a Facebook lawyer, like the one the company sent to Congress last year for hearings on how fake news swamped tech platforms such as, oh, Facebook. As Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) tweeted:","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The investigation published by the Times revealed that Cambridge Analytica, after receiving $15 million from conservative donor Robert Mercer in 2014 to micro-target voters, obtained the information to do so in a questionable way. A British professor collected the information from Facebook, saying he was conducting an academic personality study. He did get the approval of about 270,000 people who signed up to take part in the study — they were told their information would be used. He did not, however, get the permission of the users’ friends, whose information was also gathered — an estimated 50 million people.","It’s not just that such an action is unethical. It might well be a violation of an agreement Facebook made with the federal government. Two former employees of the Federal Trade Commission have now told The Post that it’s quite possible that Facebook violated a 2011 agreement with the agency to notify and offer users an out when there is an effort to use their personal information in a way not in line with their privacy settings. This agreement was reached after consumer groups complained that Facebook was cavalier with personal information.","So back to Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook found out, courtesy of a 2015 piece in the Guardian, that Cambridge Analytica and British academics had information on many users that agreed to such a collection, it demanded the information be destroyed. This did not happen. Facebook cited this when pressed on the latest revelations by the Times, claiming that the companies that misused the data “certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","(On Monday afternoon, Facebook announced that Cambridge Analytica agreed to a digital audit to prove it destroyed the disputed materials. The professors involved in using the data also agreed to an audit.)","And so, after the Times published its piece, Facebook didn’t own up to what happened. Instead, Facebook executives have gotten into a multiplespats with reporters and others over whether the Cambridge Analytica incident is a “breach” or a mere misuse of personal information, since some (but not all!) the people whose data was involved did give permission for their data to be taken and the company was not actually hacked. Facebook’s motive for this is almost certainly legal and regulatory. As Bloomberg News notes, a “breach” is a specific term that requires the company to notify users their information was illegally accessed.","But there is quite possibly a bigger motive. Painting Cambridge Analytica as the villain is an attempt to get Facebook off the hook for its ongoing role in everything from other invasions of privacy (more about that in a moment) to the ongoing complaints about its role in spreading fake news in the 2016 elections. If one or two rogue companies such as Cambridge Aanlytica — and not Facebook — are responsible for this mass misuse of data, perhaps the company can say more regulation is not needed.","But don’t fall for the idea that Facebook is not the problem. This is hardly a first-time offense for Facebook, which — a reminder — allowed fake news to flood many users’ news feeds in the months leading up to the 2016 elections.","In fact, Washington perhaps should have gotten interested in Facebook well before the Trump election contretemps. Over time, Facebook has indulged in numerous instances of dodgy behavior. There was the time Facebook altered news feeds to study whether they could affect the mood of people on the platform. There was the reveal that its platform permitted ad buyers to target people with such delightful terms as “jew hater.” And the discovery that Facebook made it possible to target housing ads to whites only.","Whether this latest scandal was a breach or a misuse of information is irrelevant. It was wrong. Zuckerberg needs to explain — slowly and clearly and without legal terminology or whiny excuses — what went wrong at the company he founded in his Harvard dorm room, and what steps the company is taking to make sure it never happens again. My suspicion? He can’t do that. Instead, a Zuckerberg appearance will demonstrate the need for significant federal regulation of large technology platforms. No wonder it hasn’t happened yet.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","Helaine OlenHelaine Olen is a contributor to the PostPartisan blog and the author of \"Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry.\" Her work has appeared in Slate, the Nation, the New York Times, the Atlantic and many other publications.

Despite the support of a U.S. senator and a legion of immigration rights activists, a U.S. Army veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan has been deported to Mexico, where he hasn’t lived since he was 8. Miguel Perez Jr., 39, was escorted across the border to Mexico and handed over to local authorities Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said.","Perez’s plight has captivated Chicago for months but it seems the campaign to help the father of two who suffered from PTSD after returning from Afghanistan didn’t persuade immigration officials to give him another chance. Perez, who has a green card, thought he automatically became a citizen when he joined the military in 2001. But he was wrong about that and then when he tried to apply for citizenship he was denied due to a felony drug conviction.","“After the second tour, there was more alcohol and that was also when I tried some drugs,” Perez said last month. “But the addiction really started after I got back to Chicago, when I got back home, because I did not feel very sociable.” He was sentenced to 15 years of prison after he was convicted on charges related to delivering more than two pounds of cocaine to an undercover officer. Earlier this year, Perez made the headlines when he started a hunger strike as a form of protest. He said his life would be in danger in Mexico because drug cartels target veterans with combat experience and force them to work.",".@DHSgov@SecNielsen: you have the power to prevent @USArmy Veteran Miguel Perez from being deported TODAY.

Tammy Duckworth of Illinois took on Perez’s plight and wrote a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, asking her to personally review the case. “Beyond the injustice that ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has laid on Perez … in his deportation, I would find it shocking to learn that he will potentially be leaving with nothing but the clothes on his back,” Duckworth wrote. “This is a deplorable way to treat a veteran who risked his life in combat for our nation.”","Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to Americans willing to risk their lives while serving in our Armed Forces.

From this, marketing experts can easily approach their potential customers,” Hoi added.","But Duc Hoang, an information technology engineer said these applications can access users’ data partly because of the users themselves.","“There are many applications and pages that encourage users to use their Facebook account to register, and then ask users to allow them access to their public profiles, timeline posts, friend lists, dates of birth, their events and their photos, and most of the time, users just agree to those terms and conditions without even reading,” he said.","Hoang said the loophole in the privacy setting has allowed hackers to obtain this data, so users should stop sharing what they're doing with their lives on Facebook and set their personal information at “Only me” mode.","Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said last Wednesday that his company made mistakes in how it handled data belonging to 50 million of its users and promised tougher steps to restrict developers' access to such information, according to Reuters.","The world's largest social media network is facing growing government scrutiny in Europe and the U.S. about a whistleblower's allegations that London-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed user information to build profiles on American voters which were later used to help elect Donald Trump in 2016.","Facebook shares fell as much as 6.5 percent, briefly dipping below $150 for the first time since July 2017, before recovering the day's losses to close up 0.4 percent at $160.06 on Monday.","The shares are still down 13 percent from March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica.

But The New York Times found Cambridge Analytica still held most of the data. Facebook suspended the company from its platform on Friday, prior to the full revelations becoming public but after it had been notified that a story was being published.","And Damian Collins, the British politician overseeing a select committee investigation into fake news, said on Sunday that Cambridge Analytica had misled members of Parliament over its use of Facebook data.","He also said Facebook executives had tried to avoid tough questions over their company's role in spreading fake news and in election interference.","\"Alexander Nix denied to the Committee last month that his company had received any data from the Global Science Research company (GSR),\" he said. \"From the evidence that has been published by The Guardian and The Observer this weekend, it seems clear that he has deliberately mislead the Committee and Parliament by giving false statements.\"","He added: \"I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry.

This piece investigates the gap between the rhetoric of data driven campaigning and actual campaign practices, especially as it relates to how the 2016 Trump campaign compares to the 2016 Clinton campaign, other prior presidential campaigns, and down-ballot races in recent years. It focuses on the use of analytics in two channels in particular, social media and email, as those offer many opportunities for targeting and message testing. Ultimately, I argue that despite the great amount of journalistic attention paid to the Trump campaign’s novel use of data and analytics, their email campaign was significantly underpowered, while their use of Facebook analytics was comparable in quality and greater in quantity than other leaders in the field.","Connect with Taylor & Francis","We use cookies to improve your website experience.

When they met the following day, she led him down a hallway praising his performance. However, when she opened the door to a meeting room, he came face to face with members of Facebook’s secretive “rat-catching” team, led by the company’s head of investigations, Sonya Ahuja.","The interrogation was a technicality; they already knew he was guilty of leaking some innocuous information to the press. They had records of a screenshot he’d taken, links he had clicked or hovered over, and they strongly indicated they had accessed chats between him and the journalist, dating back to before he joined the company.","“It’s horrifying how much they know,” he told the Guardian, on the condition of anonymity. “You go into Facebook and it has this warm, fuzzy feeling of ‘we’re changing the world’ and ‘we care about things’. But you get on their bad side and all of a sudden you are face to face with [Facebook CEO] Mark Zuckerberg’s secret police.”","The public image of Silicon Valley’s tech giants is all colourful bicycles, ping-pong tables, beanbags and free food, but behind the cartoonish facade is a ruthless code of secrecy. They rely on a combination of Kool-Aid, digital and physical surveillance, legal threats and restricted stock units to prevent and detect intellectual property theft and other criminal activity. However, those same tools are also used to catch employees and contractors who talk publicly, even if it’s about their working conditions, misconduct or cultural challenges within the company.","Zuckerberg hosts weekly meetings where he shares details of unreleased new products and strategies in front of thousands of employees. Even junior staff members and contractors can see what other teams are working on by looking at one of many of the groups on the company’s internal version of Facebook.","“When you first get to Facebook you are shocked at the level of transparency. You are trusted with a lot of stuff you don’t need access to,” said Evans, adding that during his induction he was warned not to look at ex-partners’ Facebook accounts.","“The counterbalance to giving you this huge trusting environment is if anyone steps out of line, they’ll squash you like a bug.”","The Google campus in Mountain View, California. The company has been sued for using overly broad confidentiality agreements and getting employees to spy on each other. Photograph: JasonDoiy/Getty Images","During one of Zuckerberg’s weekly meetings in 2015, after word of its new messaging assistant spread, the usually affable CEO warned employees: “We’re going to find the leaker, and we’re going to fire them.” A week later came the public shaming: Zuck revealed the culprit had been caught and fired. People at the meeting applauded.","“Companies routinely use business records in workplace investigations, and we are no exception,” said a Facebook spokeswoman, Bertie Thomson.","It’s a similar story at Google. Staff use an internal version of Google Plus and thousands of mailing lists to discuss everything from homeownership to items for sale, as well as social issues like neoconservatism and diversity. With the exception of James Damore’s explosive memo about gender and tech, most of it doesn’t leak.","By and large, staff buy into the corporate mission in a happy-clappy campus which helps foster a tribal mentality that discourages treachery. Employees are also rewarded with annual allocations of restricted stock that can buy silence for years after leaving.","“You would never do something that screws up the company’s chance of success because you are directly affected by it,” said a former Googler Justin Maxwell, who noted the pressure to behave in a “Googley” way.","The search engine’s former head of investigations, Brian Katz, highlighted this in 2016 in a company-wide email titled: “Internal only. Really.”","“If you’re considering sharing confidential information to a reporter – or to anyone externally – for the love of all that’s Googley, please reconsider! Not only could it cost you your job, but it also betrays the values that makes [sic] us a community,” he wrote.","Leaking isn’t ‘Googley’. Photograph: San Francisco Superior Court","This email came to light after another former employee sued Google for its overzealous approach to preventing leaks using overly broad confidentiality agreements and getting employees to spy on and report each other. The legal complaint alleges that Google’s policies violate labour laws that allow employees to discuss workplace conditions, wages and potential legal violations inside the company. Both parties are scheduled to enter mediation later this year.","James Damore, the software engineer who was fired from Google after writing a controversial memo questioning diversity programmes, suspects he was being monitored by the company during his final days.","He also described “weird things” happening to his work phone and laptop after the memo went viral. “All the internal apps updated at the same time, which had never happened before.

What they lack in stock options and a sense of corporate tribalism, they make up for in fear of losing their jobs.","One European Facebook content moderator signed a contract, seen by the Guardian, which granted the company the right to monitor and record his social media activities, including his personal Facebook account, as well as emails, phone calls and internet use. He also agreed to random personal searches of his belongings including bags, briefcases and car while on company premises. Refusal to allow such searches would be treated as gross misconduct.","Following Guardian reporting into working conditions of community operations analysts at Facebook’s European headquarters in Dublin, the company clamped down further, he said.","Contractors would be questioned if they took photographs in the office or printed emails or documents. “On more than one occasion someone would print something and you’d find management going through the log to see what they had printed,” said one former worker.","Security teams would leave “mouse traps” – USB keys containing data that were left around the office to test staff loyalty. “If you find a USB or something you’d have to give it in straight away. If you plugged it into a computer it would throw up a flare and you’d be instantly escorted out of the building.”","“Everyone was paranoid. When we texted each other we’d use code if we needed to talk about work and meet up in person to talk about it in private,” he said.","Some employees switch their phones off or hide them out of fear that their location is being tracked.

Even if location services aren’t switched on, Facebook can infer someone’s location from wifi access points.","“We do not use cellphones to track employee locations, nor do we track locations of people who do not work at Facebook, including reporters,” said Thomson.","Companies will also hire external agencies to surveil their staff. One such firm, Pinkerton, counts Google and Facebook among its clients.","Among other services, Pinkerton offers to send investigators to coffee shops or restaurants near a company’s campus to eavesdrop on employees’ conversations.","“If we hear anything about a new product coming, or new business ventures or something to do with stocks, we’ll feed that information back to corporate security,” said David Davari, a managing director at the firm, adding that the focus is usually IP theft or insider trading.","Facebook and Google both deny using this service.","Through LinkedIn searches, the Guardian found several former Pinkerton investigators to have subsequently been hired by Facebook, Google and Apple.","“These tools are common, widespread, intrusive and legal,” said Al Gidari, consulting director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.","“Companies are required to take steps to detect and deter criminal misconduct, so it’s not surprising they are using the same tools to make sure employees are in compliance with their contractual obligations.”","This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

(Facebook still uses these companies to help with ad measurement, though a source says that the company is reevaluating that practice, too.)","The thinking is that Facebook has less control over where and how these firms collect their data, which makes using it more of a risk.

In it, the CEO laid out the timeline for how users’ profile data fell into the hands of the voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica, which created the ads for Trump.","“We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” Zuckerberg wrote. “I’ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn’t happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it.”","Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg echoed Zuckerberg’s sentiments in her own post, while also apologizing for the leak.","“We know that this was a major violation of peoples’ trust, and I deeply regret that we didn’t do enough to deal with it,” she wrote. “We have a responsibility to protect your data — and if we can’t, then we don’t deserve to serve you.”","Facebook’s latest scandal kicked off on March 17 when The New York Times published a piece revealing how theCambridge Analytica captured the profile information of 50 million Americans without their consent to create targeted advertisements aimed at ensuring Donald Trump won the 2016 election.","Cambridge Analytica obtained that user data through Aleksander Kogan, a lecturer at Cambridge University, who originally received it from Facebook via a personality test app connected to the Facebook Platform, a tool that allowed third-party apps to connect to users’ profiles and then snake their way through the profiles of those users’ friends without asking their consent. That capability has since been turned off.","Instead, of using that profile data for the personality test, though, Kogan shared it with Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to craft political ads for the Trump campaign.","“This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,” Zuckerberg said in his statement. “But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.”","If the initial reports that Facebook had known that its users’ profile data was taken at least as far back as 2016 without coming forward wasn’t bad enough, the company then tried to deflect, saying that the matter wasn’t a data breach, but a third-party abusing their access to user profiles. And while that fact is true, no usernames or passwords were stolen, it didn’t do much to ease investors’ or advertisers’ concerns, or address the public’s trust in the social network.","Despite the growing controversy, neither Zuckerberg nor COO Sheryl Sandberg, the two faces of the company, offered any public statements on the issue until Zuckerberg’s message today. The only information from the social network came via its initial release about Cambridge Analytica and posts from lower level executives.","In his statement, Zuckerberg said his company would take three steps in preventing a similar issue from happening again. The first, he explained, was to audit all companies that had previously used the Facebook Platform prior to the company’s decision to limit access to users’ profiles to ensure there are no other such abuses. The CEO then said the company will further restrict access to users’ profile data beyond its current measures and provide a notice to all users about what apps are currently accessing their profiles.","Zuckerberg’s announcement is unlikely to quell calls for him or Sandberg to appear before Congress or British Parliament regarding the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. It’s also not likely to make investors or advertisers already wary of the recent scandal to feel any more at ease.","The Cambridge Analytica matter follows the firestorm of criticism leveled at Facebook and other social media sites over the spread of fake news and advertisements on their platforms, some of which was created by Russian political interests seeking to disrupt the 2016 election. In the midst of that, Facebook and its cohort, which include Reddit, Twitter (TWTR) and Google’s (GOOG,GOOGL) YouTube, were repeatedly chastised for allowing so-called Alt-Right, Neo Nazis and other hate groups to freely post hate speech on their sites.","More recently, such sites have taken heat for allowing conspiracy theories about the Parkland High School shooting to circulate alongside factual news articles.","As part of his annual New Year’s statement, Zuckerberg pledged to improve Facebook by tackling issues like fake news and prevent foreign interests from using the social network to influence U.S. elections.","Unfortunately, it seems, the company and its CEO still have a long way to go before they get there."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-21"}

Former US officials David Vladeck and Jessica Rich have told the Washington Post that Facebook's data sharing may violate the FTC consent decree requiring that it both ask for permission before sharing data and report any authorized access. The \"Thisisyourdigitallife\" app at the heart of the affair asked for permission from those who directly used it, but not the millions of Facebook friends whose data was taken in the process.","Facebook, for its part, said that it \"reject[s] any suggestion\" that it violated the consent decree. It maintained that it \"respected\" users' privacy settings.","If the FTC did find violations, Facebook could be on the hook for some very hefty fines -- albeit fines that aren't likely to be as hefty as possible. The decree asks for fines as large as $40,000 per person, but that would amount to roughly $2 trillion. Regulators like the FTC historically push for fines they know companies can pay, which would suggest fines that are 'just' in the billion-dollar range. Given that there are already multiple American and European investigations underway, any financial penalty would be just one piece of a larger puzzle.","The possibility of FTC action comes right as there are complaints about Facebook's response to Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who blew open the data sharing scandal. His attorney, Tamsin Allen, has stated that Facebook took a two-faced approach to Wylie's revelations. It \"privately welcomed\" Wylie's help, Allen said, but publicly suspended his account and criticized him. That was indicative of a company focused more on \"damage limitation\" than sincerely addressing the problem at hand, according to the attorney. We've asked Facebook for its response, but the accusations certainly don't help its case.","Cambridge Analytica has tried to distance itself from the incident, claiming that Wylie was a contractor rather than a founder and that it was a partner, Global Science Research, that had harvested users' data.

In short, what was Mark Zuckerberg thinking?","What makes recent disclosures about illicit uses of Facebook data so exasperating to opinion leaders and millions of everyday users is the delayed, disingenuous and tone-deaf responses from corporate management. It took five days from the publication of bombshell exposés in the New York Times and Observer, during which Facebook shed nearly $50 billion in market value, before the company’s two top executives finally issued what was widely considered to be an inadequate response.","During the protracted silence from Facebook’s CEO and COO, other senior company executives took to Twitter and Facebook to deny corporate culpability. One post vigorously disputed that Facebook’s systems had been breached, insisting on a technically correct, but blame-shifting explanation: “This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","This semantics lesson on the meaning of “breach” provided little comfort to users, who rarely parse the fine print in Facebook’s terms of service, and in any event expect Facebook to protect their private data from harmful and unauthorized use. As Mark Zuckerberg finally acknowledged in his long-awaited response (on Facebook of course), “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. “","In another instance of Facebook’s inadequate initial response, a Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast, “The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”","But Facebook’s outrage was too little, too late, as the cause of the company’s breach of trust should have been recognized and forcefully addressed over three years earlier. In 2014, a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan gave a publicized speech in Singapore, describing how he was able to analyze a sample of over 50 million Facebook users for whom he developed “the ability to predict virtually any trait.” Kogan also boasted of having built a database of every friendship made in the world on Facebook from 2006-2012.","One year later, The Guardian published a detailed account of how campaign consultancy Cambridge Analytica − who had paid to gain access to Kogan’s massive database on unwitting US Facebook users − was using detailed psychological profiles on the US electorate for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. In response, Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to certify (as in “check the box on this form”) that they had destroyed the ill-gotten user data. But Facebook failed to pursue any forensic follow up to ensure that this dangerously potent asset had in fact been wiped clean.","In early 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, and paid the firm over $6 million with the remit to provide a wide range of services including data analytics, voter profiling, micro-targeting, social media message development, digital marketing and campaign planning. Did Cambridge Analytica continue to use its ill-gotten massive Facebook database on behalf of the Trump campaign? Circumstantial evidence certainly points in that direction. Whistleblower Chris Wylie has recounted that Cambridge Analytica board member Steve Bannon had exhorted employees to weaponize psychological profiling in a self-proclaimed “win-at-any-cost” culture war being fought on the 2016 election battlefield. The Financial Times reported that Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, boasted of using “a massive database of [nearly] 5,000 data points on every adult in America” to support the successful Trump campaign. And immediately after the election, Cambridge Analytica took credit for the win, claiming that its data helped to place targeted online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times.","In his belated mea culpa, Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook “made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.” But the company’s track record of systemic failures to protect user privacy or to prevent malevolent uses of its proprietary database suggests that were it not for investigative reporting by the New York Times, Observer and undercover reporting by Channel 4 News in London, we probably would not be having an urgent public discourse on Facebook’s management shortcomings today.","Why has Facebook consistently struggled to protect its users’ personal information and to prevent malicious exploitation of its platform?","Going forward, can we trust Facebook to “take whatever steps are required” to address serious concerns with their business practices?","The most common answer to the first question is that Facebook’s business model inexorably drives their observed behavior. After all, Facebook’s success is built on amassing (or less charitably, surveilling) information on consumer behavior, enabling it to sell targeted advertising that delivers superior marketing ROI. This devilishly effective business model has enabled Facebook to create an extraordinarily profitable enterprise – in round numbers, a $50 billion revenue run rate, growing at 50% per year with 50% operating margins. It is thus not surprising that the company would be reluctant to tinker with such successful business practices.","The Perfect Storm Behind Mark Zuckerberg’s Corporate Myopia","But there is deeper dynamic at play that explains Facebook’s chronic inability to recognize the potential societal harm and reputational risk that its platform can and has engendered. Mark Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia results from the perfect storm of three leadership mindsets.","Hubristic vision and soaring ambition to change the world for the better","Overconfidence in the power of technology to solve virtually any problem","A tendency to underestimate “black swan” risks","While these management mindsets are not uncommon in Silicon Valley, when applied in a company of Facebook’s scale, the consequences can be catastrophic.","Mark Zuckerberg passionately believes that the company he founded nearly fifteen years ago has emerged as a uniquely powerful global force for good. He has often proclaimed that the Internet should be considered, like health care and clean water, a basic human right. And within that realm, Zuckerberg regards peer-to-peer communications as a powerful enabler of the company’s mission to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”","Guided by such an altruistic vision, Zuckerberg propelled Facebook’s rapid growth by aggressively pursuing more data, more media, more interactions inside and beyond the platform, more functionality, more user engagement and more global scale and reach. But in retrospect, the company’s fateful error was Zuckerberg’s decision to share user data with outside app developers starting in 2008 (expanded further between 2011 and 2014) in exchange for enhancing Facebook’s functionality and the ability to track its users beyond its platform. By extending Facebook’s surveillance beyond the walled garden of internally generated user data, the company signaled its preference for more data acquisition and portability over safeguarding user privacy.","MAU growthAuthor analysis from company data","Along the way, Facebook certainly was aware of “bad actors” on its platform − the ones that bully users, plant fake news for profit, mindless fun or influence, or who promote fraudulent commerce. But Zuckerberg has consistently exuded confidence that his company’s sophisticated software could detect and prevent malevolent abuses on his platform, despite alarming evidence that Facebook’s bad actor problem has been worsening for years.","There were plenty of reasons for Zuckerberg to overlook danger signs bubbling below the surface of Facebook’s business. By any measure, Facebook had been spectacularly successful in creating a global juggernaut. By the end of 2017, Facebook was serving over 2 billion users and more than 5 million advertisers, rewarding shareholders (including its largest stakeholder, Mark Zuckerberg) with a company valued in excess of one-half trillion dollars.","Such outsized success undoubtedly contributed to Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia in failing to recognize and mitigate the risks of rare, but potentially catastrophic abuses on his platform. Best-selling author and scholar Nassim Taleb has written extensively on the common human tendency to underestimate the likelihood of “black swan” events − defined as situations with low probability but extremely high downside risk. For example, black swan myopia arguably contributed to the lax risk management that led to a number of preventable disasters, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the financial services meltdown of 2008.","In Facebook’s case, black swan myopia led Mark Zuckerberg to largely ignore the reputational risk posed by the malevolent use of Facebook user data before, during and after the 2016 presidential election. Before Cambridge Analytica even began working for the Trump campaign, Facebook failed to verify that the consultancy had actually destroyed its large illicit cache of Facebook user data. During the campaign, Facebook continued to ignore growing reports that the Trump campaign was effectively deploying psychological profiling and micro-targeting techniques, rife with fake news and targeted imagery in pivotal swing states.","And even after President Trump’s gobsmacking victory, Zuckerberg continued to proclaim that the notion that fake news could have influenced the U.S. presidential election was a \"pretty crazy idea,\" going on to dismiss the importance of filter bubbles and claiming that fake news represents a \"very small volume\" of the total content on Facebook’s platform.","Zuckerberg’s stubborn denial of the ability of Cambridge Analytica and other foreign political operatives to exploit Facebook’s data and platform to influence voter behavior is bizarrely hypocritical, since the secret sauce that has always driven Facebook’s profitability is its proven ability to enable advertisers to precisely tailor product messaging to targeted prospective customers.","According to whistleblower Chris Wylie, Steve Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the stated objective of using psychological profiling tools to change voters’ cultural attitudes. In fighting a self-proclaimed culture war, Bannon understood that micro-targeting − akin to smart bombs − could be far more cost effective than carpet bombing political ads on mass media. Cambridge Analytica arguably was in a position to be particularly effective in this regard because they illicitly gained the access to Facebook’s vast user database to build detailed psychological profiling models.","Mark Zuckerberg is not alone in falling prey to the perfect storm of corporate myopia. One could argue that Travis Kalanick at Uber and Elizabeth Holmes at Theranos also had hubristic visions to change the world for the better, coupled with overconfidence in the infallibility of their technology and an inability to recognize black swan risks threatening to damage their company and the world at large. Kalanick was ultimately forced to resign from Uber by his board, and Holmes recently settled a lawsuit with the SEC that forced her to forfeit control of Theranos, now in tatters.","There are of course key differences in Zuckerberg’s case. Unlike the other two executives, Facebook has been spectacularly profitable, and Zuckerberg enjoys bulletproof shareholder control of his company. Under these circumstances, the question is, how will Mark Zuckerberg address the growing challenges threatening Facebook’s future?","Can Zuckerberg Clean Up Facebook’s Mess?","The key to answering this question lies in understanding what problem Mark Zuckerberg will choose to address: quelling the current uproar over the Cambridge Analytica debacle, or addressing broader, longstanding concerns with Facebook’s unprecedented global power to control access to information hiding behind its opaque business practices.","Zuckerberg’s mea culpa media tour starting March 21st clearly signaled his primary interest on the first problem. In his interview with Recode’s Kara Swisher, Zuckerberg opined “the good news is that as of three or four years ago, new apps weren’t able to do what happened here. So this is largely ... this issue is resolved going forward for a while.” As Swisher rightfully observed, Zuckerberg’s comments were predominantly backward-looking, and inadequately recognized the broader challenges that lie ahead.","By focusing Facebook’s attention on tracking down possible terms of service violations by thousands of third party developers many years ago, and promising new controls on developer platform access, Zuckerberg framed Facebook’s problem entirely in terms of external data portability, ignoring the fact that through these interactions, Facebook also amassed and retains extensive data on user behavior for its own commercial purposes.","Worries over just how much user data Facebook routinely collects and how that information is used erupted again this week when press accounts revealed that Facebook has been logging Android users’ telephone calls and SMS messages for years. As with prior concerns expressed over the company’s expansive data capture, Facebook reprised its typical response: “we never sell your data and trust us, having all this information helps us provide a better user experience on our platform.”","But a growing chorus of political leaders no longer trusts Facebook’s blame-shifting apologies and repeated assurances of altruistic intent, and are now calling for the company’s CEO to testify before Congress on a broad range of data privacy concerns. The FTC has also weighed in, opening an investigation to determine whether Facebook’s business practices have been violating a 2011 agreement settling charges over the company’s user privacy policies.","So how can we expect Facebook to respond? Given Mark Zuckerberg’s management mindset, and the company’s track record in dealing with past crises, it would take overwhelming pressure from the government or other key stakeholders for Facebook to move beyond reactive tweaks to its business practices. The harsh reality is, Facebook’s stakeholders are unlikely to mount a serious and sustained challenge to the company’s status quo.","Users","The potential for a user revolt clearly poses the gravest threat to Facebook’s market dominance, which explains why Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have devoted so much of their apology tour last week seeking to restore user trust. Facebook executives are well aware that Uber reportedly lost as much as 15 percentage points of market share in major US metro markets last year after a #deleteuber campaign erupted over the company’s alleged mishandling of its response to protests over President Trump’s Muslim country travel ban. In Uber’s case, consumers had a readily available choice to switch to a competitor (Lyft) offering an essentially comparable service.","Facebook’s situation is considerably different. Despite the genuine outrage expressed over recent damaging revelations, isolated calls to #deletefacebook have failed to gain much traction simply because Facebook is too deeply embedded in the lives of its 2 billion users. Consciously or unwittingly, the vast majority of Facebook users appear to have accepted the Faustian bargain of trading their personal data for free access to Facebook’s valued services. Don’t expect many Facebook or Instagram users to switch to Snapchat any time soon.","Advertisers","As long as users remain engaged on the platform, advertisers will be understandably reluctant to exclude Facebook from their advertising mix. No platform provides nearly as much market reach, targeting effectiveness or useful ROI tracking tools as Facebook. Consequently, why would Facebook’s 5 million advertisers be willing to cede such advantages to competitors? While a few companies have in fact announced a temporary suspension of Facebook advertising (e.g., Pep Boys, Sonos, Commerzbank), Facebook is likely to remain a dominant a channel for most advertisers in the months ahead.","Investors/Government","As long as users and advertisers stay on board, many investors are likely to follow suit. Facebook’s recent loss of market value largely reflects current investor nervousness over the prospect for restrictive government regulation. Mark Zuckerberg surprisingly fanned the flames of investor concern by signaling his support for appropriate regulatory controls.","But there are reasons to doubt that government action will be swift, comprehensive or overly damaging to Facebook’s business model. For starters, President Trump will obviously seek to discourage debate on an issue that relitigates the legitimacy of his 2016 election. On Capitol Hill, Congress already has a full agenda of more pressing political issues to deal with, going into the 2018 midterm elections. As such, today’s announcement that the FTC is launching an investigation of Facebook may give Congress cover to pass the baton in dealing with this gnarly issue.","It would not be surprising to see Facebook voluntarily announcing a few enhancements to its data privacy policies in the coming months to diminish the perceived urgency for comprehensive government regulation. These dynamics suggest that government action is likely to be slow and measured at best, giving investors time to monitor and react to Facebook’s actual financial performance in the months ahead, which promises to remain strong.","Board of directors","Facebook has a distinguished board that in normal circumstances could be counted on to exert strong oversight over the company's operational and reputational risk management. But a board can go only so far in reining in a CEO who controls 60% of the voting shares of the fifth largest publicly traded company in the world. Mark Zuckerberg will continue to be the loudest voice in the room in guiding Facebook’s strategic direction.","Competitors","What competitors? Facebook has exploited strong network economies of scale and a relentless appetite to acquire or replicate the services of upstart competitors. While it is true that Facebook will likely be barred from additional major acquisitions, the company has already built a seemingly unassailable lead over competitors in the advertising-supported social media space. Even if Congress does act to impose limits on future user data sourcing and portability, it may actually strengthen Facebook’s current competitive advantage given that it already has by far the biggest user database in the industry.","So where does that leave us? In the months ahead, we’re likely to see a number of incremental improvements in Facebook’s business practices through a combination of voluntary company policy changes and possible regulatory reforms governing the allowable sourcing and use of personal data.","Greater transparency in identifying the sponsors and content of targeted ads on Facebook’s platform (particularly those involving political content)","Tighter controls over user data portability across the Internet","More stringent requirements for users to be asked for opt-in permission (in clear language) before Facebook can collect and store user data.","These welcome changes will not unduly crimp Facebook’s extraordinarily successful business model, and may even help Mark Zuckerberg overcome his corporate myopia that has exposed the company to preventable reputational risk in the past.

In short, what was Mark Zuckerberg thinking?","What makes recent disclosures about illicit uses of Facebook data so exasperating to opinion leaders and millions of everyday users is the delayed, disingenuous and tone-deaf responses from corporate management. It took five days from the publication of bombshell exposés in the New York Times and Observer, during which Facebook shed nearly $50 billion in market value, before the company’s two top executives finally issued what was widely considered to be an inadequate response.","During the protracted silence from Facebook’s CEO and COO, other senior company executives took to Twitter and Facebook to deny corporate culpability. One post vigorously disputed that Facebook’s systems had been breached, insisting on a technically correct, but blame-shifting explanation: “This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","This semantics lesson on the meaning of “breach” provided little comfort to users, who rarely parse the fine print in Facebook’s terms of service, and in any event expect Facebook to protect their private data from harmful and unauthorized use. As Mark Zuckerberg finally acknowledged in his long-awaited response (on Facebook of course), “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. “","In another instance of Facebook’s inadequate initial response, a Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast, “The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”","But Facebook’s outrage was too little, too late, as the cause of the company’s breach of trust should have been recognized and forcefully addressed over three years earlier. In 2014, a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan gave a publicized speech in Singapore, describing how he was able to analyze a sample of over 50 million Facebook users for whom he developed “the ability to predict virtually any trait.” Kogan also boasted of having built a database of every friendship made in the world on Facebook from 2006-2012.","One year later, The Guardian published a detailed account of how campaign consultancy Cambridge Analytica − who had paid to gain access to Kogan’s massive database on unwitting US Facebook users − was using detailed psychological profiles on the US electorate for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. In response, Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to certify (as in “check the box on this form”) that they had destroyed the ill-gotten user data. But Facebook failed to pursue any forensic follow up to ensure that this dangerously potent asset had in fact been wiped clean.","In early 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, and paid the firm over $6 million with the remit to provide a wide range of services including data analytics, voter profiling, micro-targeting, social media message development, digital marketing and campaign planning. Did Cambridge Analytica continue to use its ill-gotten massive Facebook database on behalf of the Trump campaign? Circumstantial evidence certainly points in that direction. Whistleblower Chris Wylie has recounted that Cambridge Analytica board member Steve Bannon had exhorted employees to weaponize psychological profiling in a self-proclaimed “win-at-any-cost” culture war being fought on the 2016 election battlefield. The Financial Times reported that Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, boasted of using “a massive database of [nearly] 5,000 data points on every adult in America” to support the successful Trump campaign. And immediately after the election, Cambridge Analytica took credit for the win, claiming that its data helped to place targeted online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times.","In his belated mea culpa, Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook “made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.” But the company’s track record of systemic failures to protect user privacy or to prevent malevolent uses of its proprietary database suggests that were it not for investigative reporting by the New York Times, Observer and undercover reporting by Channel 4 News in London, we probably would not be having an urgent public discourse on Facebook’s management shortcomings today.","Why has Facebook consistently struggled to protect its users’ personal information and to prevent malicious exploitation of its platform?","Going forward, can we trust Facebook to “take whatever steps are required” to address serious concerns with their business practices?","The most common answer to the first question is that Facebook’s business model inexorably drives their observed behavior. After all, Facebook’s success is built on amassing (or less charitably, surveilling) information on consumer behavior, enabling it to sell targeted advertising that delivers superior marketing ROI. This devilishly effective business model has enabled Facebook to create an extraordinarily profitable enterprise – in round numbers, a $50 billion revenue run rate, growing at 50% per year with 50% operating margins. It is thus not surprising that the company would be reluctant to tinker with such successful business practices.","The Perfect Storm Behind Mark Zuckerberg’s Corporate Myopia","But there is deeper dynamic at play that explains Facebook’s chronic inability to recognize the potential societal harm and reputational risk that its platform can and has engendered. Mark Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia results from the perfect storm of three leadership mindsets.","Hubristic vision and soaring ambition to change the world for the better","Overconfidence in the power of technology to solve virtually any problem","A tendency to underestimate “black swan” risks","While these management mindsets are not uncommon in Silicon Valley, when applied in a company of Facebook’s scale, the consequences can be catastrophic.","Mark Zuckerberg passionately believes that the company he founded nearly fifteen years ago has emerged as a uniquely powerful global force for good. He has often proclaimed that the Internet should be considered, like health care and clean water, a basic human right. And within that realm, Zuckerberg regards peer-to-peer communications as a powerful enabler of the company’s mission to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”","Guided by such an altruistic vision, Zuckerberg propelled Facebook’s rapid growth by aggressively pursuing more data, more media, more interactions inside and beyond the platform, more functionality, more user engagement and more global scale and reach. But in retrospect, the company’s fateful error was Zuckerberg’s decision to share user data with outside app developers starting in 2008 (expanded further between 2011 and 2014) in exchange for enhancing Facebook’s functionality and the ability to track its users beyond its platform. By extending Facebook’s surveillance beyond the walled garden of internally generated user data, the company signaled its preference for more data acquisition and portability over safeguarding user privacy.","MAU growthAuthor analysis from company data","Along the way, Facebook certainly was aware of “bad actors” on its platform − the ones that bully users, plant fake news for profit, mindless fun or influence, or who promote fraudulent commerce. But Zuckerberg has consistently exuded confidence that his company’s sophisticated software could detect and prevent malevolent abuses on his platform, despite alarming evidence that Facebook’s bad actor problem has been worsening for years.","There were plenty of reasons for Zuckerberg to overlook danger signs bubbling below the surface of Facebook’s business. By any measure, Facebook had been spectacularly successful in creating a global juggernaut. By the end of 2017, Facebook was serving over 2 billion users and more than 5 million advertisers, rewarding shareholders (including its largest stakeholder, Mark Zuckerberg) with a company valued in excess of one-half trillion dollars.","Such outsized success undoubtedly contributed to Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia in failing to recognize and mitigate the risks of rare, but potentially catastrophic abuses on his platform. Best-selling author and scholar Nassim Taleb has written extensively on the common human tendency to underestimate the likelihood of “black swan” events − defined as situations with low probability but extremely high downside risk. For example, black swan myopia arguably contributed to the lax risk management that led to a number of preventable disasters, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the financial services meltdown of 2008.","In Facebook’s case, black swan myopia led Mark Zuckerberg to largely ignore the reputational risk posed by the malevolent use of Facebook user data before, during and after the 2016 presidential election. Before Cambridge Analytica even began working for the Trump campaign, Facebook failed to verify that the consultancy had actually destroyed its large illicit cache of Facebook user data. During the campaign, Facebook continued to ignore growing reports that the Trump campaign was effectively deploying psychological profiling and micro-targeting techniques, rife with fake news and targeted imagery in pivotal swing states.","And even after President Trump’s gobsmacking victory, Zuckerberg continued to proclaim that the notion that fake news could have influenced the U.S. presidential election was a \"pretty crazy idea,\" going on to dismiss the importance of filter bubbles and claiming that fake news represents a \"very small volume\" of the total content on Facebook’s platform.","Zuckerberg’s stubborn denial of the ability of Cambridge Analytica and other foreign political operatives to exploit Facebook’s data and platform to influence voter behavior is bizarrely hypocritical, since the secret sauce that has always driven Facebook’s profitability is its proven ability to enable advertisers to precisely tailor product messaging to targeted prospective customers.","According to whistleblower Chris Wylie, Steve Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the stated objective of using psychological profiling tools to change voters’ cultural attitudes. In fighting a self-proclaimed culture war, Bannon understood that micro-targeting − akin to smart bombs − could be far more cost effective than carpet bombing political ads on mass media. Cambridge Analytica arguably was in a position to be particularly effective in this regard because they illicitly gained the access to Facebook’s vast user database to build detailed psychological profiling models.","Mark Zuckerberg is not alone in falling prey to the perfect storm of corporate myopia. One could argue that Travis Kalanick at Uber and Elizabeth Holmes at Theranos also had hubristic visions to change the world for the better, coupled with overconfidence in the infallibility of their technology and an inability to recognize black swan risks threatening to damage their company and the world at large. Kalanick was ultimately forced to resign from Uber by his board, and Holmes recently settled a lawsuit with the SEC that forced her to forfeit control of Theranos, now in tatters.","There are of course key differences in Zuckerberg’s case. Unlike the other two executives, Facebook has been spectacularly profitable, and Zuckerberg enjoys bulletproof shareholder control of his company. Under these circumstances, the question is, how will Mark Zuckerberg address the growing challenges threatening Facebook’s future?","Can Zuckerberg Clean Up Facebook’s Mess?","The key to answering this question lies in understanding what problem Mark Zuckerberg will choose to address: quelling the current uproar over the Cambridge Analytica debacle, or addressing broader, longstanding concerns with Facebook’s unprecedented global power to control access to information hiding behind its opaque business practices.","Zuckerberg’s mea culpa media tour starting March 21st clearly signaled his primary interest on the first problem. In his interview with Recode’s Kara Swisher, Zuckerberg opined “the good news is that as of three or four years ago, new apps weren’t able to do what happened here. So this is largely ... this issue is resolved going forward for a while.” As Swisher rightfully observed, Zuckerberg’s comments were predominantly backward-looking, and inadequately recognized the broader challenges that lie ahead.","By focusing Facebook’s attention on tracking down possible terms of service violations by thousands of third party developers many years ago, and promising new controls on developer platform access, Zuckerberg framed Facebook’s problem entirely in terms of external data portability, ignoring the fact that through these interactions, Facebook also amassed and retains extensive data on user behavior for its own commercial purposes.","Worries over just how much user data Facebook routinely collects and how that information is used erupted again this week when press accounts revealed that Facebook has been logging Android users’ telephone calls and SMS messages for years. As with prior concerns expressed over the company’s expansive data capture, Facebook reprised its typical response: “we never sell your data and trust us, having all this information helps us provide a better user experience on our platform.”","But a growing chorus of political leaders no longer trusts Facebook’s blame-shifting apologies and repeated assurances of altruistic intent, and are now calling for the company’s CEO to testify before Congress on a broad range of data privacy concerns. The FTC has also weighed in, opening an investigation to determine whether Facebook’s business practices have been violating a 2011 agreement settling charges over the company’s user privacy policies.","So how can we expect Facebook to respond? Given Mark Zuckerberg’s management mindset, and the company’s track record in dealing with past crises, it would take overwhelming pressure from the government or other key stakeholders for Facebook to move beyond reactive tweaks to its business practices. The harsh reality is, Facebook’s stakeholders are unlikely to mount a serious and sustained challenge to the company’s status quo.","Users","The potential for a user revolt clearly poses the gravest threat to Facebook’s market dominance, which explains why Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have devoted so much of their apology tour last week seeking to restore user trust. Facebook executives are well aware that Uber reportedly lost as much as 15 percentage points of market share in major US metro markets last year after a #deleteuber campaign erupted over the company’s alleged mishandling of its response to protests over President Trump’s Muslim country travel ban. In Uber’s case, consumers had a readily available choice to switch to a competitor (Lyft) offering an essentially comparable service.","Facebook’s situation is considerably different. Despite the genuine outrage expressed over recent damaging revelations, isolated calls to #deletefacebook have failed to gain much traction simply because Facebook is too deeply embedded in the lives of its 2 billion users. Consciously or unwittingly, the vast majority of Facebook users appear to have accepted the Faustian bargain of trading their personal data for free access to Facebook’s valued services. Don’t expect many Facebook or Instagram users to switch to Snapchat any time soon.","Advertisers","As long as users remain engaged on the platform, advertisers will be understandably reluctant to exclude Facebook from their advertising mix. No platform provides nearly as much market reach, targeting effectiveness or useful ROI tracking tools as Facebook. Consequently, why would Facebook’s 5 million advertisers be willing to cede such advantages to competitors? While a few companies have in fact announced a temporary suspension of Facebook advertising (e.g., Pep Boys, Sonos, Commerzbank), Facebook is likely to remain a dominant a channel for most advertisers in the months ahead.","Investors/Government","As long as users and advertisers stay on board, many investors are likely to follow suit. Facebook’s recent loss of market value largely reflects current investor nervousness over the prospect for restrictive government regulation. Mark Zuckerberg surprisingly fanned the flames of investor concern by signaling his support for appropriate regulatory controls.","But there are reasons to doubt that government action will be swift, comprehensive or overly damaging to Facebook’s business model. For starters, President Trump will obviously seek to discourage debate on an issue that relitigates the legitimacy of his 2016 election. On Capitol Hill, Congress already has a full agenda of more pressing political issues to deal with, going into the 2018 midterm elections. As such, today’s announcement that the FTC is launching an investigation of Facebook may give Congress cover to pass the baton in dealing with this gnarly issue.","It would not be surprising to see Facebook voluntarily announcing a few enhancements to its data privacy policies in the coming months to diminish the perceived urgency for comprehensive government regulation. These dynamics suggest that government action is likely to be slow and measured at best, giving investors time to monitor and react to Facebook’s actual financial performance in the months ahead, which promises to remain strong.","Board of directors","Facebook has a distinguished board that in normal circumstances could be counted on to exert strong oversight over the company's operational and reputational risk management. But a board can go only so far in reining in a CEO who controls 60% of the voting shares of the fifth largest publicly traded company in the world. Mark Zuckerberg will continue to be the loudest voice in the room in guiding Facebook’s strategic direction.","Competitors","What competitors? Facebook has exploited strong network economies of scale and a relentless appetite to acquire or replicate the services of upstart competitors. While it is true that Facebook will likely be barred from additional major acquisitions, the company has already built a seemingly unassailable lead over competitors in the advertising-supported social media space. Even if Congress does act to impose limits on future user data sourcing and portability, it may actually strengthen Facebook’s current competitive advantage given that it already has by far the biggest user database in the industry.","So where does that leave us? In the months ahead, we’re likely to see a number of incremental improvements in Facebook’s business practices through a combination of voluntary company policy changes and possible regulatory reforms governing the allowable sourcing and use of personal data.","Greater transparency in identifying the sponsors and content of targeted ads on Facebook’s platform (particularly those involving political content)","Tighter controls over user data portability across the Internet","More stringent requirements for users to be asked for opt-in permission (in clear language) before Facebook can collect and store user data.","These welcome changes will not unduly crimp Facebook’s extraordinarily successful business model, and may even help Mark Zuckerberg overcome his corporate myopia that has exposed the company to preventable reputational risk in the past. Whether we “Like” it or not, we’re destined to live in the social media world we collectively helped Facebook build for many more years to come.","I am an Executive in Residence and Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, teaching courses in business strategy and corporate entrepreneurship.

While it is new that we have a whistleblower, and the number “50 million accounts”, what the media isn’t telling you is how Cambridge Analytica actually pulled this off.","The fact of the matter is the data that Cambridge Analytica acquired from Facebook, much of which they obtained legally and as Facebook intended them to, was entirely useless without machine learning. Machine learning is one of the baby steps required for building artificial intelligence, it is a field of computer science that gives computer systems the ability to “learn” with data without being programmed by a person. It was this technology that Cambridge Analytica used to analyze tens of millions of users profiles using data they acquired from Facebook, and put together psychological profiles of users.

However, that is actually more valuable to them than not. There is little point to spending advertising dollars on people who you know will vote for your candidate, the person you want to target is actually the person who will not vote for your candidate and instead convince them to not vote. This is what I believe Cambridge Analytica did, I believe they targeted liberals in swing states and promoted anti-Hillary content in an attempt to convince people not to vote. It means they had to target fewer people, spend less money, and ultimately accomplish their goal of winning the election.","All Cambridge Analytica had to do was figure out who was a liberal, and convince them not to show up on election day. By doing so they could ignore everyone who couldn’t vote for whatever reason, and only spend a small portion of their budget on making sure Trump supporters showed up to vote. A no-vote was actually more powerful in swing states, where guess what? Liberal voter turnout was lower for Hillary than it was for Obama. Granted, I still think Hillary blew it and didn’t campaign properly. I am not excusing her ineptitude, she was a horrible candidate and I did not vote for her (Yes, I voted for the female doctor instead, and no I don’t regret it, lets just not talk about it, okay?).","Perhaps this is a just a giant coincidence, but I don’t think it is. Given Donald Trump’s ad spend, I’m fairly certain this is exactly what happened. The reason I believe this is because if I were hired to help win an election and had the tools and data Cambridge Analytica had, it is exactly what I would do. I don’t have anything to prove my theory unfortunately, but given what is being reported I am fairly certain I am on to something, and first came up with this theory a year ago before the media went into freak out mode.","This is why psychological profiling, privacy, machine learning, and artificial intelligence is so frightening when put in the wrong hands. It isn’t the machines we need to fear, it is the people who are in control of those machines and our data that we need to worry about. Machines are just tools, but people are fickle and with the right incentive easily corrupted.","Facebook, Not Russia, Helped Trump Win The Election","We know from Wikileaks that John Podesta was in touch with Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, and even thanked her for helping them “elect the first woman President of the United States.” However, Hillary didn’t win despite the fact Facebook was trying to get her elected alongside Google who was censoring search results, possibly running their own bots, and Twitter who was censoring the truth and purposely hiding Wikileaks tweets which are 100% factual (as they later admitted to congress).","The reason Hillary Clinton did not win despite the media and social media companies doing everything they could to rig the election in her favor is because Facebook double dipped and allowed Cambridge Analytica to use their surveying tools to collect user data on tens of millions of users. This data was then used to target tens of millions of users with political advertising using Facebook’s ad platform based on psycholgoical profiles from data they bought or acquired from Facebook.","Facebook is basically responsible for feeding the analytics system that enabled Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign to be so targeted and effective with a minimal budget. They ultimately won Donald Trump the swing states and the election. As well as subverted democracy, and likely made Facebook a bunch of money.","That’s what happened, that’s how Trump won. It wasn’t the Russians, it was our own social media companies who sold our data to the Trump campaign which they then likely used to convince liberals not to vote in swing states. It’s both horrifying, and cleverly brilliant at the same time."],"isopubdate":""}

It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.","We have updated the story accordingly.","Original story:","Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief information security officer, will shift roles at the company. His transition will come in the wake of disagreements with other Facebook executives like COO Sheryl Sandberg about how to investigate and disclose Russian activity on the platform, The New York Times reports, citing employees of the social network. Stamos advocated for greater disclosure. Prior to his hiring at Facebook in 2015, Stamos was Chief Information Security Officer at Yahoo.","Personnel on Stamos' security team—which previously numbered 120 but is now down to three—are being gradually transferred to the product and infrastructure divisions within Facebook, under his supervision. The NYT report suggests that this has been part of his responsibilities since December, when his normal day-to-day responsibilities as CSO were reassigned. He was asked by Facebook to stay through August for optics.","Stamos is currently working in a new role in the company. \"I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security,\" he tweeted. He has not commented on any future plans to depart the organization entirely—a tweet clarifying his role after The New York Times report did not dispute the report's claim that he is leaving Facebook in August.","This news broke shortly after Facebook came under intense scrutiny over the inappropriate acquisition of its user data by Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm involved in elections in both the US and the UK. Stamos took to Twitter to defend the company—in particular, he sought to clarify that this was not a \"data breach.\" He also said in a tweet that has since been deleted:","It should be noted that several other prominent platforms, like Android and iOS, allow access to friend (contact) data with user permission. Like us, those platforms have policies about the use of data, but misusing contacts gathered knowingly from a phone is also not a \"breach\".","Stamos later deleted those tweets, saying he \"should have done a better job weighing in.\" Echoing some of the concerns that reportedly led to his departure from the role, he later tweeted:","There are a lot of big problems that the big tech companies need to be better at fixing.

The idea was likely to help businesses find customers interested in their products, but the tool was shown to allow exclusion of certain ethnic affinity groups in ways that could be used to exclude them from legally protected opportunities such as housing; employment, and loans. Facebook has since disabled this kind of targeting while investigates the situation.","Real Name Policy = Enabling Stalkers – For years, Facebook strictly required to use their real names in order to reduce uncivility and bullying facilitated by hiding behind anonymity. But victims of stalking, domestic violence, and hate crimes argued that their abusers could use Facebook to track them down and harass them. Only after mounting criticism from the transgender community and others did Facebook slightly relax the policy in 2015, though some still find it onerous to set up a pseudonym on Facebook and dangerous to network without one.","Internet.org = International Net Neutrality Concerns – Facebook’s plan to give free Internet access to developing nations has been largely criticized as merely a way to wrap a user growth strategy in a philanthropic bow. Internet.org’s app initially offered a limited set of free services, excluding some competing social networks and featuring Facebook’s products. While some think giving free access to a slice of the web is better than none for those who might not be able to afford it, others see the zero-rating programs as a form of digital colonialism designed to get the poor hooked on a certain company’s version of the Internet.

I've also used Ghostery for the same reason. Of course, these tools also block countless other sites, most of them I don't even know (though I'm sure they know me...)","Are there any benefits for using Facebook Container, or the more general Multi-Account Containers if I'm already blocking these sites?","What do they want to do?","uBlock","uBlock Origin (or uBlock₀) is not an ad blocker; it's a general-purpose blocker. [...] Ads, \"unintrusive\" or not, are just the visible portions of privacy-invading apparatus entering your browser when you visit most sites nowadays. uBlock₀'s main goal is to help users neutralize such privacy-invading apparatus — in a way that welcomes those users who don't wish to use more technical, involved means [...].","Firefox Containers","Rather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain.","This sounds very similar, but the differences are in the details.\nuBlock is focused on privacy on a broad scale and users sometimes have to hazard the consequences -> buttons can stop functioning, sites can break etc.\nThe Firefox extensions are the parent-version of a neat tool to ensure some privacy. You can still use all services. There can be some collateral damage, but rarely for the typical user. And it's all color-coded, weeeee!","What do they do?","uBlock","uBlock Origin blocks these three types of annoyances: ads, trackers and sometimes malware sites, but can do a lotmore. It has a pretty wide range for such a lean tool, but you have to be somewhat experienced to make use of the more interesting options like medium and hard mode. And if you do, sites will regularly start to break if you browse like most of the regular internet users.\nIf you take a look at the documentation I linked to, you will see what uBlock can do \"under the hood\".","Note: a lot of blocking by uBlock requires filter lists. The maintenance of theses lists is very difficult and tiresome and is done by a lot of nice people on the interwebz. Because they do it for free, sometimes trackers will not get blocked, because they are not on the list you are using. IMO that is not all too problematic, because the problem you as a user have stems from forming profiles, not from creating single points of information. If the contributors update the lists properly and you regularly update your filter list it is likely that the next time you visit a site with that tracker, it will not track you.","Firefox Containers","In the description of Firefox Multi-Account Containers, we find the following:","Each Container stores cookies separately, so you can log into the same site with different accounts and online trackers can’t easily connect the browsing.","This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing.

A lot of data is accesible for sites you visit across tabs - for instance: cookies.\nContainered tabs - this is what we are looking at here - prevent this.","How does it affect you as an end user?","You can easily use both addons. I would definitely recommend uBlock (go for the hard mode). There are some restrictions that containerization brings to the table that can be helpful. I am not too knowledgeable about the inner workings of it though.\nConclusion: The two addons are very different, but that is very much okay, because they have different goals and I would say different audiences with different privacy needs.","Tom, thank you for the detailed answer! A more specific question - you've said \"Firefox Multi-Account Containers neither block ads nor trackers\", but Mozilla's post says: \"This makes it harder for Facebook to track your activity on other websites via third-party cookies.\" (I'll add that to the question) - so it is meant to stop at least one tracker.

The central question, among many, is this: Did Facebook effectively subsidize Donald Trump’s campaign by charging him less to advertise on the social network than it charged Hillary Clinton’s team?","Advertisement","If the answer to that sounds like it should be a simple “yes” or “no,” well, get ready to be confused. The back-and-forth between Wired contributor Antonio García Martínez, Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth, and people who worked on both the Trump and Clinton campaigns has shed more heat than light thus far. It’s become wonky enough, and hard enough to follow, that a pair of BuzzFeedreporters decided to give it the full reaction-GIF treatment, covering it as they would a juicy online spat between celebrities. (For those who want to catch up on the basic contours of the debate, the BuzzFeedpost is actually not a bad place to start.)","At issue is the very nature of Facebook’s advertising system and whether it skews the playing field for political ads in a way that gives Trump-like candidates an (arguably unfair) advantage. For all of Facebook’s protestations, there remain good reasons to believe it does. But as to what extent, and exactly how that played out in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, it’s now clear that Facebook hasn’t yet released enough data for anyone to confidently say.","The case laid out in García Martínez’s original Wiredpiece was an explosive one. He explained that while ads on Facebook are sold via an automated auction, the advertiser who bid the highest dollar amount doesn’t always win. Instead, he wrote, the winner is chosen by an algorithm that combines the dollar amount of the bid with a prediction of how likely users are to interact with the ad in some way, such as clicking a link or hitting the like button. (Facebook calls this the ad’s “relevance score.”) That could have had a significant impact on the effective ad rates the two campaigns faced, García Martínez wrote. From his op-ed:","During the run-up to the election, the Trump and Clinton campaigns bid ruthlessly for the same online real estate in front of the same swing-state voters. But because Trump used provocative content to stoke social media buzz, and he was better able to drive likes, comments, and shares than Clinton, his bids received a boost from Facebook’s click model, effectively winning him more media for less money. In essence, Clinton was paying Manhattan prices for the square footage on your smartphone’s screen, while Trump was paying Detroit prices.","Advertisement","That insight, coming from a man who helped to create Facebook’s ad-targeting tools, provoked outrage from commentators who saw Facebook as essentially rigging the system in Trump’s favor, albeit presumably unintentionally. The flames were fanned when Brad Parscale, who directed Trump’s digital media efforts in 2016 (and was just named his campaign manager for 2020), not only endorsed the Wiredstory but added an incredible detail. He suggested that the Clinton campaign was in some cases paying 100–200 times as much as the Trump campaign to reach the same number of people on Facebook.","If that weren’t enough, Clinton’s former communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, appeared to tweet her agreement with Parscale’s estimate. It seemed, briefly, as though that might close the case. Twitter swelled with calls for Facebook to be regulated or boycotted, or—as the journalist Tom Scocca suggested, perhaps half jokingly—for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be sent to prison.","Then came a curveball from Facebook, in the form of a series of tweets by Andrew Bosworth. Here’s the money chart (figuratively and literally):","Advertisement","CPM is ad-industry jargon for “cost per mille”—that is, the cost an advertiser pays for 1,000 people to view a given ad. Higher CPM means you’re paying more to reach the same number of people. So whereas García Martínez implied that Trump paid less for ads, and Parscale claimed Trump paid 100 times less, Facebook’s data seemed to indicate that he actually paid a little more than Clinton, on a per-view basis.","Bosworth went on to note that the two campaigns pursued different strategies in their Facebook advertising, and that “[p]rices depend on factors like size of audience and campaign objective.” He added that Facebook wants to share more campaign data with researchers and will reach out to the campaigns for permission to share information about their ad campaigns, which Facebook would otherwise keep confidential. In the meantime, he said the company was putting out that price chart “to clear up any confusion.”","Clearing up confusion, however, does not seem to have been its chief effect. People struggled to reconcile Bosworth’s chart with everything they had thought they just learned from García Martínez about how Facebook worked. Could it be that everyone was wrong, and Trump wasn’t the perfect Facebook candidate after all?","Advertisement","Not necessarily. Let’s consider two seemingly conflicting claims:","1. Trump got more bang for his buck on Facebook ads than Clinton.","2. Trump paid higher ad rates, on average, than Clinton, to reach the same number of people.","Those couldn’t both be true, could they? In fact, insiders say, they very well could.","Advertisement","The key to understanding this is that the Trump and Clinton campaigns, by all accounts, used Facebook in fundamentally different ways—as the Washington Post’s Philip Bump explained and Bosworth himself acknowledged. From Bump’s illuminating article:","Clinton ran a lot of video ads, aiming to boost turnout or make the case for her candidacy. Trump’s ads were often single images with an enticement to click. The ads were designed to do different things.","In other words, many of Clinton’s ads were simply meant to be viewed, whereas many of Trump’s ads were meant to spur a specific action from users—whether that was signing up for a mailing list, buying a MAGA hat, or even making a donation. In ad parlance, Clinton was running more brand advertising whereas Trump was running more direct-response advertising.","That’s crucial, if true, because the two strategies lend themselves to different pricing schemes and different ways of measuring success. If all you care about is putting your ad in front of swing-state voters’ eyeballs, you might as well buy ads on a CPM basis. But if you’re trying to sell merch, there might be more relevant metrics, such as CPC (cost per click) or CPA (cost per action)—and many advertisers, including Facebook, allow you to pay by the click or action rather than the impression.","Advertisement","Direct-response ads tend to be more expensive on a per-view basis, as Bosworth acknowledged in a statement. But they can also be much more potent, depending on your goals. As a political candidate, if you get 1,000 people to click on your campaign’s donation page with the intent to give money, that could be worth far more than getting 1,000 people to spend a few seconds viewing your autoplay video in their Facebook feed. If Trump’s campaign was focused on the former, that could help to explain how Trump ended up paying higher ad rates on a CPM basis, as Bosworth’s chart showed—even if he was paying far lower rates on a CPC basis.","As one Republican operative told Wired’s Issie Lapowsky: “A CPM price isn’t the metric we’re measuring success against.” Indeed, Lapowsky reports, the Trump campaign experimented with a staggering variety of different ad types, including at least one ad that reportedly just asked voters to “text Trump to 88022.” The cost of that ad, in CPM, according to Lapowsky’s source: a paltry 20 cents.","Some observers have also wondered whether a difference in organic reach between Trump’s ads and Clinton’s could have caused disparities that weren’t captured in the CPM chart. In other words, if Facebook users were more likely to share Trump ads with their friends on Facebook, then more people would have seen them in their feeds. Two people with knowledge of how Facebook’s ad system works told me they doubted that effect was major, simply because people don’t tend to intentionally share ads on Facebook very often. Still, it seems possible that some of Trump’s campaign ads were an exception, given the often inflammatory tone of his messaging and the level of enthusiasm among some of his core supporters. Many of his ads were essentially memes.","In short, nothing Bosworth has said disproves the speculation by García Martínez and others that Facebook’s advertising system played to Trump’s advantage in various ways. We know that ads that generate interaction from users travel farther on Facebook for the same amount of money, so if Trump’s ads did that, then it stands to reason that his campaign benefitted accordingly.","Advertisement","That said, Facebook’s response to the controversy served as an important reminder that without more data, any claims about which campaign paid how much for what result should be treated with caution. Wired posted an update to García Martínez’s story on Wednesday acknowledging Bosworth’s tweets and explaining why the data he shared “do not confirm or deny the hypotheses contained in this piece.”","More data from Facebook and the campaigns would certainly be welcome, at this point. For what it’s worth, Facebook notes that its forthcoming ad-transparency tools should help to clarify some of these sorts of questions in the future. Until then, it’s worth remembering that campaign ads on Facebook represent just one way in which the platform shaped the election. Claims of biases in Facebook’s ad rates draw attention, because political advertising has traditionally been regulated. But ads make up just a fraction of people’s news feeds. When it came to amplifying pro-Trump and anti-Clinton messages, the biases in Facebook’s news feed algorithm—which govern who sees what posts from their friends and the pages they follow—likely had a far greater effect."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-01"}

{"originalurl":"http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/BBKqHLR?ocid=st","title":"Everything you need to know about the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook debacle","text":["Late on Friday, Facebook made an unexpected announcement: The data firm Cambridge Analytica, hyped as integral to President Trump’s election, was suspended from the social network for using data collected improperly from Facebook users.","It is a complicated issue that many people might have missed, given the timing of the announcement. With that in mind, here is an overview of the groups involved, what happened — and what it means.","1. What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a data firm that promises its customers insights into consumer or voter behavior.","On the commercial side, that means tools like “audience segmentation” — breaking out advertising audiences into smaller groups — and then targeting advertisements to those groups on “multiple platforms.”","On the political side, it is much the same thing, with one tweak. While advertisers generally target consumers as groups, political campaigns need to target specific people — registered voters receptive to a potential message.","“Combining the precision of data analytics with the insights of behavioral psychology and the best of individually addressable advertising technology,” the company’s website pledges, “you can run a truly end-to-end campaign.” And that is why Cambridge Analytica was created.","Robert Mercer is a prominent conservative donor whose public profile rose sharply over the past few years. He and his daughter Rebekah invested millions in efforts to reshape conservative politics, funding Citizens United, the anti-mainstream-media Media Research Center and Breitbart News.","In 2013, Robert Mercer partnered with a British firm called SCL Group and its elections director Alexander Nix to test SCL’s methodology in Virginia’s governor’s race, as the New York Times reported. Their candidate, Republican Ken Cuccinelli, lost. But the Mercers moved forward with a political data strategy anyway, partnering with Nix to create Cambridge Analytica, which would use SCL’s data and methodology for political work.","2. What prompted the Facebook suspension?","The key part of the Cambridge Analytica sales pitch is that “insights of behavioral psychology” line.","There are lots of data companies that can tell you who’s registered to vote, and there are lots of companies that compile consumer data on those same voters. This, in fact, was an instrumental part of Facebook’s sales pitch to political campaigns (back before it quietly buried that pitch in the wake of questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election). After the 2014 election, we wrote about how Facebook offered campaigns a place to overlap their voter data (who’s registered and basic demographic information) with Facebook’s vast array of data on its users’ behavior. While most firms that collect data on consumer behavior do so by tracking the bread crumbs we leave around our consumer culture — grocery store rewards cards, magazine subscriptions, etc. — Facebook has the advantage that so many Americans tell the company precisely what they like, by quite literally clicking the “like” button.","Facebook’s database of personal information may be the largest in the world, given that nearly a third of the globe has an account with the company. If you are a company looking to provide data services, you would justifiably be jealous of the information Facebook possesses. So Facebook (recognizing an opportunity when it sees it) provides a way for software developers to build on top of their platform, allowing other companies to use their data under certain conditions. It used to be fairly trivial, in fact, for developers to build an application that would then pull a great deal of information from the site, including information about your friends’ activity. In May 2014, the site announced it was tightening that access, beginning the following year.","That change came slightly too late.","To apply its “insights of behavioral psychology” to national politics, as the Mercers intended, the SCL/Cambridge team needed a lot of information about a lot of Americans. According to the Times’s report, a Cambridge employee named Christopher Wylie encountered a researcher at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan built an application that leveraged Facebook’s tools to pull information from the site and then pitched its use using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a tool that allows developers to hire humans (sometimes then referred to as “turkers”) to do simple tasks for small fees.","“The task posted by ‘Global Science Research’ appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would ‘download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.’ ”","Global Science Research was Kogan. Using this method, he gathered information on tens of millions of Americans. (The Times says more than 50 million; other outlets say 30 million.) That information was then used to build out SCL/Cambridge Analytica’s profiles.","In building his Facebook application, Kogan had pledged that his data collection was only for research purposes and that it would remain anonymized — not able to be linked to specific people. When the Guardian reported in late 2015 on the link between Kogan and Cambridge, it prompted Facebook to promise to investigate the situation. (The Guardian’s story was pegged to Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) presidential campaign using Cambridge Analytica for its voter contact efforts. Cruz was strongly supported by the Mercers, who also created well-funded outside groups to promote his candidacy.)","In its statement on Friday announcing the suspensions, Facebook carefully put the blame on Kogan misusing its tools and explained it had demanded in 2015 that Kogan, SCL and Cambridge delete its Facebook data. The suspension was prompted by learning last week — apparently after being contacted by the Times — that Cambridge was still in possession of some of the Facebook data. (The company denies that.)","3. What does Cambridge Analytica’s data actually look like?","It is not clear, but we do have one hint.","A professor at New York’s New School named David Carroll was studying ad targeting when he realized Cambridge’s link with SCL meant the company might be subject to Britain’s broader data-access laws, allowing him to potentially see what data the company had collected on him. In March 2017, he got a response.","It is not clear how Cambridge/SCL developed that profile of Carroll (which he described on Twitter as “accurate”), but one can see how Facebook data might help inform those categories.","One can also see how, once the profile was developed, the Facebook data underlying it would become unnecessary. It is as though you sneaked a peek at the secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken and then developed your own recipe based on it. You may not be in possession of the recipe, but that is sort of beside the point.","4. Where does the Trump campaign fit into this?","Trump’s digital team was run by Brad Parscale, who last month was named campaign manager for Trump’s 2020 effort. Trump’s general election campaign was slow to get geared up after the primary, and, by mid-2016, there was a debate over how to invest in digital marketing. Bolstered by Parscale’s advocacy (and Jared Kushner’s championing) the campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, over then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s apparent objections. The decision may have been made easier, too, by Cambridge/SCL’s role in the successful Brexit campaign in Britain the same month.","As noted above, the Mercers had been hoping Cruz would be the Republican nominee. Once Trump won the Republican nomination, though, they shifted their focus. (The extent to which the hiring of Cambridge Analytica greased that transition is not clear.) They were reportedly instrumental in the August 2016 overhaul of Trump’s campaign, recommending the hiring of both Stephen K. Bannon (from Breitbart) and Kellyanne Conway, who had been working for one of their pro-Cruz PACs.","Over the last few months of the campaign, Parscale’s team invested heavily in Facebook advertising, even hosting a Facebook employee at their Texas war room who helped guide their work. The advertising the campaign deployed was informed by Cambridge Analytica’s data.","Bloomberg reported on the data team shortly before the election and how Parscale managed the competing data from Cambridge and the Republican Party.","“Parscale was building his own list of Trump supporters, beyond the RNC’s reach,” Bloomberg’s Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg wrote. “Cambridge Analytica’s statistical models isolated likely supporters whom Parscale bombarded with ads on Facebook, while the campaign bought up email lists from the likes of Gingrich and Tea Party groups to prospect for others.”","One footnote: Campaign adviser Michael Flynn also contracted with SCL shortly before the end of the campaign, though he apparently never did any work for the company.","5. Does this mean Trump won the election unfairly?","Well, this is a broader question: Does Cambridge actually help win elections? Or, put another way: How much of Cambridge’s rhetoric about psychographics is just hype?","6. Fine. Where has Cambridge Analytica won elections?","In most cases, it is very hard to identify one particular factor that made the difference in a political campaign. Despite the ubiquity of politicking, campaigns do not happen that often and, when they do, there are thousands of factors that make each contest unique. So analyzing the effects of campaign tactics means perusing a small sample in which we are asked to compare apples to oranges to grapes to dogs to stars to love to six.","This is hugely advantageous for political consulting firms because it is often hard to check their claims about how effective they are. Politicians are deeply superstitious and seize on their own and others’ past successes to guide their decisions moving forward. What’s more, the field of data-driven political persuasion is fairly new, meaning a company that can claim success in a realm many career politicians do not really understand has a huge marketing advantage. Say that you have cracked the code to targeting voters with specific messages, and a lot of campaigns will write you checks.","Cambridge Analytica has not been around that long, but they have been involved in several successful campaigns. There was Sen. Thom Tillis’s (R-N.C.) Senate campaign in 2014, which he won by 1.5 points. There was the “Leave” campaign in the United Kingdom in 2016 which won by 3.8 points. And there was Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.1 points but who won the electoral college.","There were also losing campaigns. Before Trump, the highest-profile effort Cambridge undertook was Cruz’s — and he lost. Sure, he ended up in second place in the delegate count despite being fairly unpopular the year before, but his strategy was like Trump’s: leverage a core base of support to ride out a crowded field of candidates.","In June 2016, Politico reported that Cruz’s team “was disappointed in Cambridge Analytica’s services and stopped using them before the Nevada GOP caucuses in late February, according to a former staffer for the Texas Republican.”","So it is hard to say in the abstract the effect Cambridge might have had in Trump’s race — and it is harder still to say what role the laundered Facebook data played.","Two days before the election, Cambridge’s Nix said in an interview that his firm actually wasn’t able to leverage its psychographics on Trump’s behalf.","Here is Nix, speaking to TechCrunch:","“We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitative psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.”","An important asterisk: Two days before the election, Nix (and nearly everyone else in America) likely thought Trump was going to lose. A good way for a political consulting company to cover its back in the event of a loss is to say that it did not have the time to deploy its core value proposition.","7. Is special counsel Robert S. Mueller III tracking this whole thing?","Apparently.","Given that the Trump campaign and Cambridge invested so much in targeting people online and given that we know Russian actors tried to leverage Facebook ads and social media to influence voters, there is a natural question as to whether those two efforts had any coordination.","In July, McClatchy reported Mueller’s team was looking specifically at that.","“Congressional and Justice Department investigators are focusing on whether Trump’s campaign pointed Russian cyber operatives to certain voting jurisdictions in key states,” Peter Stone and Greg Gordon wrote. They quoted a former Pentagon staffer named Mike Carpenter. “There appears to have been significant cooperation between Russia’s online propaganda machine and individuals in the United States who were knowledgeable about where to target the disinformation,” Carpenter said.","8. So are there links to Russia?","Well, it depends on what you mean by “links.” We are in this weird moment where any even tangential link to Russia or a Russian person is heralded as a sign of questionable collusion.","So here is what we know.","The Times reports that SCL Group had spoken with the Russian oil giant Lukoil in 2014 and 2015, and that the company “was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.” (In an interview with the “Today” show on Monday, Wylie reiterated this claim.)","The paper also notes that Cambridge included questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 focus groups, though we will note this was also the time period in which Russia’s seizing of Crimea became central to American foreign policy conversations.","Late last year, the Daily Beast reported that Nix had contacted WikiLeaks’s Julian Assange before the election offering to host emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman to create a searchable database. Assange declined the offer. Those emails are believed to have been stolen by Russian hackers linked to the country’s intelligence agencies.","One other link is worth mentioning. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher who developed the tool that led to the Facebook suspension, had reportedly also received a grant from the Russian government to research social media.","“Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way,” Kogan told the Guardian."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The company is facing multiple privacy investigations in the U.S. and U.K. over the leak of personal information pertaining to as many as 60 million Facebook users to voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica (see Probes Begin as Facebook Slammed by Data Leak Blowback).","Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged last week to improve privacy protections and be more transparent with users. The latest findings, however, suggest a deeper disconnect between what Facebook stores and what users expected the site to gather.","The privacy uproar over Cambridge Analytica has led some users to download their Facebook archive, a rich repository of personal information the site has cataloged. Over the last several days, those archives have yielded data users have found surprising.","Some archives show contact information that Facebook has collected from mobile phone address books. Other information included detailed call logs, such as to whom a call was made for how long and records of SMS messages. The information is metadata - data pertaining to other data, in this case concerning details of transmissions; but it does not include the content of those calls or communications.","Permission Granted?","Facebook maintains that it has always asked for permission for that kind of information, but some users say they never granted permission. The situation gained steam after a tweet last Wednesday from Dylan McKay, a software developer and student in Wellington, New Zealand.","He found call logs for every chat he had with his partner's mother between 2016 and last year. McKay has created an informal survey that's so far gathered about 1,000 responses on what type of metadata people have found in their Facebook archives.","McKay's tweet prompted others to dig around their Facebook archives. Emma Kennedy, a London-based author, writes on Twitter that she never granted permission for Facebook to collect the data she found.","I've just looked at the data files I requested from Facebook and they had every single phone number in my contacts. They had every single social event I went to, a list of all my friends (and their birthdays) and a list of every text I've sent.","\"They have plundered my phone,\" Kennedy writes in another tweet. \"They have phone numbers of people who aren't on Facebook. They have phone numbers of household names who, I'm sure, would be furious to know their phone numbers are accessible. I'm appalled.\"","Only Android Affected","It appears the surprise call logs are only showing up for Facebook users on Android devices. Apple has never allowed developers access to call logs or SMS data on iOS, in large part for security reasons, but it does allow access to the address book. Apple officials in Sydney did not have an immediate comment.","Facebook addressed the latest controversy in a blog post on Sunday. The logging of calls and text history has been an opt-in feature in Messenger since 2015 and in Facebook Lite.","Facebook Lite was launched in 2015. It's aimed at developing markets and uses less data than the full-fledged app. The company only made it available last week to users in the U.S., Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand.","Suspicion Centers on Android Messenger App","It doesn't appear that the people who are complaining that their contacts have been uploaded to Facebook and calls logged would have been able to use Facebook Lite. Hence by process of elimination, that appears to make Facebook's Messenger app the culprit.","Facebook asserts that users have always been asked for their permission. Aside from other technical explanations that have yet to emerge, that means if Facebook's characterization is accurate, forgetful memories may have fueled an unjustified outcry.","However, the publication Ars Technica suggests a different possible scenario, rooted in Android's historical permissions settings, may have occurred.","The Google-developed Android operating system allows users to give permissions to apps for certain functions. When someone downloads an app, the app asks if it is allowed to access certain data or functionality, such as a phone's camera or microphone, contacts or other information.","Over the years, as some apps became more aggressive or deceptive and security concerns emerged, Android began offering more fine-grained access permissions. But in versions of Android 4.1 and prior, granting access to a phone's contacts list also granted access to call and message logs by default, Ars reports.","That means that Facebook - when asking for contacts information - could have also received the call and SMS metadata. The permission structure, however, was changed in version 16 of the Android API.","But Ars Technica reports that Android apps could get around the change by writing to the old version of the API. The old version of the API, 4.0, was only deprecated in Android last October, it adds.","When asked about the Ars Technica report, Facebook maintains that it has always asked for permission to log call and text history even if Android did not. The company provided screen shots of the current advisories that are displayed by Android after Messenger is installed.","These are the current advisories displayed by Android after someone installs Facebook's Messenger.","While the Android advisory windows do describe some of the behaviors that Messenger would be allowed to do with contacts, calls and SMS messages, it doesn't state that the data will be stored on Facebook's servers. However, Facebook is more direct in its advisory.","The feature is headlined \"Text anyone in your phone\" and then says it will \"continuously upload info about your contacts like phone numbers and nicknames, and your call and text history.\"","Facebook's disclosure in Messenger","Questions Remain","ISMG asked Facebook if Ars Technica's theory is the reason for why users are surprised, and also asked if Facebook could clarify how it asked for permissions for past versions of the full Facebook mobile app and Messenger, but it did not receive a reply.","Asking for access to a mobile phone's address book is common among app developers because it is used to match a new user with other people they know and who use the same app. The key in this situation, however, is whether Facebook has been clear enough with users over how much data it has been collecting.","In its blog post, Facebook says it does not share call or SMS metadata with third parties.","It is possible for users to delete contacts data the social network has collected. Also, in Messenger, users can turn off a menu item that continuously uploads new contact information to the company.","Facebook also says it is possible to turn off the setting that syncs a person's call and text history.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","See the full visual","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick Guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","See the full visual","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

In short, what was Mark Zuckerberg thinking?","What makes recent disclosures about illicit uses of Facebook data so exasperating to opinion leaders and millions of everyday users is the delayed, disingenuous and tone-deaf responses from corporate management. It took five days from the publication of bombshell exposés in the New York Times and Observer, during which Facebook shed nearly $50 billion in market value, before the company’s two top executives finally issued what was widely considered to be an inadequate response.","During the protracted silence from Facebook’s CEO and COO, other senior company executives took to Twitter and Facebook to deny corporate culpability. One post vigorously disputed that Facebook’s systems had been breached, insisting on a technically correct, but blame-shifting explanation: “This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","This semantics lesson on the meaning of “breach” provided little comfort to users, who rarely parse the fine print in Facebook’s terms of service, and in any event expect Facebook to protect their private data from harmful and unauthorized use. As Mark Zuckerberg finally acknowledged in his long-awaited response (on Facebook of course), “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. “","In another instance of Facebook’s inadequate initial response, a Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast, “The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”","But Facebook’s outrage was too little, too late, as the cause of the company’s breach of trust should have been recognized and forcefully addressed over three years earlier. In 2014, a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan gave a publicized speech in Singapore, describing how he was able to analyze a sample of over 50 million Facebook users for whom he developed “the ability to predict virtually any trait.” Kogan also boasted of having built a database of every friendship made in the world on Facebook from 2006-2012.","One year later, The Guardian published a detailed account of how campaign consultancy Cambridge Analytica − who had paid to gain access to Kogan’s massive database on unwitting US Facebook users − was using detailed psychological profiles on the US electorate for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. In response, Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to certify (as in “check the box on this form”) that they had destroyed the ill-gotten user data. But Facebook failed to pursue any forensic follow up to ensure that this dangerously potent asset had in fact been wiped clean.","In early 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, and paid the firm over $6 million with the remit to provide a wide range of services including data analytics, voter profiling, micro-targeting, social media message development, digital marketing and campaign planning. Did Cambridge Analytica continue to use its ill-gotten massive Facebook database on behalf of the Trump campaign? Circumstantial evidence certainly points in that direction. Whistleblower Chris Wylie has recounted that Cambridge Analytica board member Steve Bannon had exhorted employees to weaponize psychological profiling in a self-proclaimed “win-at-any-cost” culture war being fought on the 2016 election battlefield. The Financial Times reported that Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, boasted of using “a massive database of [nearly] 5,000 data points on every adult in America” to support the successful Trump campaign. And immediately after the election, Cambridge Analytica took credit for the win, claiming that its data helped to place targeted online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times.","In his belated mea culpa, Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook “made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.” But the company’s track record of systemic failures to protect user privacy or to prevent malevolent uses of its proprietary database suggests that were it not for investigative reporting by the New York Times, Observer and undercover reporting by Channel 4 News in London, we probably would not be having an urgent public discourse on Facebook’s management shortcomings today.","Why has Facebook consistently struggled to protect its users’ personal information and to prevent malicious exploitation of its platform?","Going forward, can we trust Facebook to “take whatever steps are required” to address serious concerns with their business practices?","The most common answer to the first question is that Facebook’s business model inexorably drives their observed behavior. After all, Facebook’s success is built on amassing (or less charitably, surveilling) information on consumer behavior, enabling it to sell targeted advertising that delivers superior marketing ROI. This devilishly effective business model has enabled Facebook to create an extraordinarily profitable enterprise – in round numbers, a $50 billion revenue run rate, growing at 50% per year with 50% operating margins. It is thus not surprising that the company would be reluctant to tinker with such successful business practices.","The Perfect Storm Behind Mark Zuckerberg’s Corporate Myopia","But there is deeper dynamic at play that explains Facebook’s chronic inability to recognize the potential societal harm and reputational risk that its platform can and has engendered. Mark Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia results from the perfect storm of three leadership mindsets.","Hubristic vision and soaring ambition to change the world for the better","Overconfidence in the power of technology to solve virtually any problem","A tendency to underestimate “black swan” risks","While these management mindsets are not uncommon in Silicon Valley, when applied in a company of Facebook’s scale, the consequences can be catastrophic.","Mark Zuckerberg passionately believes that the company he founded nearly fifteen years ago has emerged as a uniquely powerful global force for good. He has often proclaimed that the Internet should be considered, like health care and clean water, a basic human right. And within that realm, Zuckerberg regards peer-to-peer communications as a powerful enabler of the company’s mission to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”","Guided by such an altruistic vision, Zuckerberg propelled Facebook’s rapid growth by aggressively pursuing more data, more media, more interactions inside and beyond the platform, more functionality, more user engagement and more global scale and reach. But in retrospect, the company’s fateful error was Zuckerberg’s decision to share user data with outside app developers starting in 2008 (expanded further between 2011 and 2014) in exchange for enhancing Facebook’s functionality and the ability to track its users beyond its platform. By extending Facebook’s surveillance beyond the walled garden of internally generated user data, the company signaled its preference for more data acquisition and portability over safeguarding user privacy.","MAU growthAuthor analysis from company data","Along the way, Facebook certainly was aware of “bad actors” on its platform − the ones that bully users, plant fake news for profit, mindless fun or influence, or who promote fraudulent commerce. But Zuckerberg has consistently exuded confidence that his company’s sophisticated software could detect and prevent malevolent abuses on his platform, despite alarming evidence that Facebook’s bad actor problem has been worsening for years.","There were plenty of reasons for Zuckerberg to overlook danger signs bubbling below the surface of Facebook’s business. By any measure, Facebook had been spectacularly successful in creating a global juggernaut. By the end of 2017, Facebook was serving over 2 billion users and more than 5 million advertisers, rewarding shareholders (including its largest stakeholder, Mark Zuckerberg) with a company valued in excess of one-half trillion dollars.","Such outsized success undoubtedly contributed to Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia in failing to recognize and mitigate the risks of rare, but potentially catastrophic abuses on his platform. Best-selling author and scholar Nassim Taleb has written extensively on the common human tendency to underestimate the likelihood of “black swan” events − defined as situations with low probability but extremely high downside risk. For example, black swan myopia arguably contributed to the lax risk management that led to a number of preventable disasters, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the financial services meltdown of 2008.","In Facebook’s case, black swan myopia led Mark Zuckerberg to largely ignore the reputational risk posed by the malevolent use of Facebook user data before, during and after the 2016 presidential election. Before Cambridge Analytica even began working for the Trump campaign, Facebook failed to verify that the consultancy had actually destroyed its large illicit cache of Facebook user data. During the campaign, Facebook continued to ignore growing reports that the Trump campaign was effectively deploying psychological profiling and micro-targeting techniques, rife with fake news and targeted imagery in pivotal swing states.","And even after President Trump’s gobsmacking victory, Zuckerberg continued to proclaim that the notion that fake news could have influenced the U.S. presidential election was a \"pretty crazy idea,\" going on to dismiss the importance of filter bubbles and claiming that fake news represents a \"very small volume\" of the total content on Facebook’s platform.","Zuckerberg’s stubborn denial of the ability of Cambridge Analytica and other foreign political operatives to exploit Facebook’s data and platform to influence voter behavior is bizarrely hypocritical, since the secret sauce that has always driven Facebook’s profitability is its proven ability to enable advertisers to precisely tailor product messaging to targeted prospective customers.","According to whistleblower Chris Wylie, Steve Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the stated objective of using psychological profiling tools to change voters’ cultural attitudes. In fighting a self-proclaimed culture war, Bannon understood that micro-targeting − akin to smart bombs − could be far more cost effective than carpet bombing political ads on mass media. Cambridge Analytica arguably was in a position to be particularly effective in this regard because they illicitly gained the access to Facebook’s vast user database to build detailed psychological profiling models.","Mark Zuckerberg is not alone in falling prey to the perfect storm of corporate myopia. One could argue that Travis Kalanick at Uber and Elizabeth Holmes at Theranos also had hubristic visions to change the world for the better, coupled with overconfidence in the infallibility of their technology and an inability to recognize black swan risks threatening to damage their company and the world at large. Kalanick was ultimately forced to resign from Uber by his board, and Holmes recently settled a lawsuit with the SEC that forced her to forfeit control of Theranos, now in tatters.","There are of course key differences in Zuckerberg’s case. Unlike the other two executives, Facebook has been spectacularly profitable, and Zuckerberg enjoys bulletproof shareholder control of his company. Under these circumstances, the question is, how will Mark Zuckerberg address the growing challenges threatening Facebook’s future?","Can Zuckerberg Clean Up Facebook’s Mess?","The key to answering this question lies in understanding what problem Mark Zuckerberg will choose to address: quelling the current uproar over the Cambridge Analytica debacle, or addressing broader, longstanding concerns with Facebook’s unprecedented global power to control access to information hiding behind its opaque business practices.","Zuckerberg’s mea culpa media tour starting March 21st clearly signaled his primary interest on the first problem. In his interview with Recode’s Kara Swisher, Zuckerberg opined “the good news is that as of three or four years ago, new apps weren’t able to do what happened here. So this is largely ... this issue is resolved going forward for a while.” As Swisher rightfully observed, Zuckerberg’s comments were predominantly backward-looking, and inadequately recognized the broader challenges that lie ahead.","By focusing Facebook’s attention on tracking down possible terms of service violations by thousands of third party developers many years ago, and promising new controls on developer platform access, Zuckerberg framed Facebook’s problem entirely in terms of external data portability, ignoring the fact that through these interactions, Facebook also amassed and retains extensive data on user behavior for its own commercial purposes.","Worries over just how much user data Facebook routinely collects and how that information is used erupted again this week when press accounts revealed that Facebook has been logging Android users’ telephone calls and SMS messages for years. As with prior concerns expressed over the company’s expansive data capture, Facebook reprised its typical response: “we never sell your data and trust us, having all this information helps us provide a better user experience on our platform.”","But a growing chorus of political leaders no longer trusts Facebook’s blame-shifting apologies and repeated assurances of altruistic intent, and are now calling for the company’s CEO to testify before Congress on a broad range of data privacy concerns. The FTC has also weighed in, opening an investigation to determine whether Facebook’s business practices have been violating a 2011 agreement settling charges over the company’s user privacy policies.","So how can we expect Facebook to respond? Given Mark Zuckerberg’s management mindset, and the company’s track record in dealing with past crises, it would take overwhelming pressure from the government or other key stakeholders for Facebook to move beyond reactive tweaks to its business practices. The harsh reality is, Facebook’s stakeholders are unlikely to mount a serious and sustained challenge to the company’s status quo.","Users","The potential for a user revolt clearly poses the gravest threat to Facebook’s market dominance, which explains why Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have devoted so much of their apology tour last week seeking to restore user trust. Facebook executives are well aware that Uber reportedly lost as much as 15 percentage points of market share in major US metro markets last year after a #deleteuber campaign erupted over the company’s alleged mishandling of its response to protests over President Trump’s Muslim country travel ban. In Uber’s case, consumers had a readily available choice to switch to a competitor (Lyft) offering an essentially comparable service.","Facebook’s situation is considerably different. Despite the genuine outrage expressed over recent damaging revelations, isolated calls to #deletefacebook have failed to gain much traction simply because Facebook is too deeply embedded in the lives of its 2 billion users. Consciously or unwittingly, the vast majority of Facebook users appear to have accepted the Faustian bargain of trading their personal data for free access to Facebook’s valued services. Don’t expect many Facebook or Instagram users to switch to Snapchat any time soon.","Advertisers","As long as users remain engaged on the platform, advertisers will be understandably reluctant to exclude Facebook from their advertising mix. No platform provides nearly as much market reach, targeting effectiveness or useful ROI tracking tools as Facebook. Consequently, why would Facebook’s 5 million advertisers be willing to cede such advantages to competitors? While a few companies have in fact announced a temporary suspension of Facebook advertising (e.g., Pep Boys, Sonos, Commerzbank), Facebook is likely to remain a dominant a channel for most advertisers in the months ahead.","Investors/Government","As long as users and advertisers stay on board, many investors are likely to follow suit. Facebook’s recent loss of market value largely reflects current investor nervousness over the prospect for restrictive government regulation. Mark Zuckerberg surprisingly fanned the flames of investor concern by signaling his support for appropriate regulatory controls.","But there are reasons to doubt that government action will be swift, comprehensive or overly damaging to Facebook’s business model. For starters, President Trump will obviously seek to discourage debate on an issue that relitigates the legitimacy of his 2016 election. On Capitol Hill, Congress already has a full agenda of more pressing political issues to deal with, going into the 2018 midterm elections. As such, today’s announcement that the FTC is launching an investigation of Facebook may give Congress cover to pass the baton in dealing with this gnarly issue.","It would not be surprising to see Facebook voluntarily announcing a few enhancements to its data privacy policies in the coming months to diminish the perceived urgency for comprehensive government regulation. These dynamics suggest that government action is likely to be slow and measured at best, giving investors time to monitor and react to Facebook’s actual financial performance in the months ahead, which promises to remain strong.","Board of directors","Facebook has a distinguished board that in normal circumstances could be counted on to exert strong oversight over the company's operational and reputational risk management. But a board can go only so far in reining in a CEO who controls 60% of the voting shares of the fifth largest publicly traded company in the world. Mark Zuckerberg will continue to be the loudest voice in the room in guiding Facebook’s strategic direction.","Competitors","What competitors? Facebook has exploited strong network economies of scale and a relentless appetite to acquire or replicate the services of upstart competitors. While it is true that Facebook will likely be barred from additional major acquisitions, the company has already built a seemingly unassailable lead over competitors in the advertising-supported social media space. Even if Congress does act to impose limits on future user data sourcing and portability, it may actually strengthen Facebook’s current competitive advantage given that it already has by far the biggest user database in the industry.","So where does that leave us? In the months ahead, we’re likely to see a number of incremental improvements in Facebook’s business practices through a combination of voluntary company policy changes and possible regulatory reforms governing the allowable sourcing and use of personal data.","Greater transparency in identifying the sponsors and content of targeted ads on Facebook’s platform (particularly those involving political content)","Tighter controls over user data portability across the Internet","More stringent requirements for users to be asked for opt-in permission (in clear language) before Facebook can collect and store user data.","These welcome changes will not unduly crimp Facebook’s extraordinarily successful business model, and may even help Mark Zuckerberg overcome his corporate myopia that has exposed the company to preventable reputational risk in the past. Whether we “Like” it or not, we’re destined to live in the social media world we collectively helped Facebook build for many more years to come.","I am an Executive in Residence and Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, teaching courses in business strategy and corporate entrepreneurship.

Facebook also plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details. (Paul Sakuma/Associated Press)","Facebook is giving its privacy tools a makeover as it reels from criticisms over its data practices and faces tighter European regulations in the coming months.","The changes won't affect Facebook's privacy policies or the types of data it gathers on users. But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings. Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them.","Wednesday's announcement follows revelations that a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing.","In addition, Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices.","Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for \"some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.\"","Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details.","The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people. For example, Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings onto a single privacy page.","Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls. Now, Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place. Facebook says it is also adding \"clearer explanations\" about how its privacy controls work.","Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, called the new settings \"the first of many steps\" the company is taking to address privacy concerns.","Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which was approved two years ago and takes effect May 25. The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data. They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents, no matter where it is based.","To comply with this, Facebook is adding a section called \"access your information,\" a secure way for users to manage data they've shared with the company, including status updates, comments and things they have searched for. That's where people can go to delete information or download a copy.","While this download was already possible, it took some time to figure out how to do it. Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail, without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past.","Cox said that while the changes are \"in line with the principle of GDPR,\" there's also a \"bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

If you haven't done it already, you'll probably want to stop what you're doing and grab it all now.","How to get your data","In typical Facebook fashion, it's easy to get this data, but only if you know exactly where to look. That's what I'm here for.","Click this link. You're looking for facebook.com/settings. If for some strange reason that doesn't work, on desktop, you want to click the little upside-down triangle in the upper right-hand corner, then drop down and click \"Settings.\"","Click where it says \"Download Archive.\" You will likely have to reenter your password. Facebook will need about 10 or 15 minutes to compile your data and will send you a link via email to get your information.","Check your email spam folder; the message Facebook sent me wasn't readily visible in my inbox. The subject should read \"Your Facebook download is ready.\" Click the link in your email and you'll be sent back to Facebook again--and probably have to enter your password once more. (This is a good thing; there's a lot of personal information in the files they're sending you.)","Click the \"Download Archive\" button on this second screen, and you'll download a .zip file that should be called: \"facebook-YOURUSERNAME.zip.\" Extract the files by clicking on the .zip file in most cases, and you'll wind up with a series of folders. There should be a file called simply \"index.html.\"","Click on that, and the archive should open in your browser.","So, what's in the archive?","Depending on how long you've been on Facebook and how active a user you've been, you might want to have a cup of coffee or something. There could be a lot to look at.","You'll want to start with the index.html file, because when you click on that, it will open a locally hosted webpage in your default browser. That will allow you to navigate through everything as you would any webpage, with links for Profile, Contact Info, Timeline, Photos, Videos, Friends, Messages, Pokes (remember those?), Events, Security, Ads, and Applications on the left side of the page.","In my case, I found the data to be stunning in terms of its breadth--but also its incompleteness. In some cases, it might be a matter of simple mistakes; in other cases, I think I might have intentionally given Facebook bad data. Some of this was more than a decade ago when I first signed up for Facebook, and I honestly don't remember.","Facebook documents the date on which I became friends with everyone I'm \"Facebook friends\" with. And I was able to quickly find the first message anyone sent me or posted on my wall. (From my sister, back in April 2007: \"Hey Bill--did not know you were on facebook--how are you?\")","But at the same time, lots of basic data was either incomplete or wrong, starting with my date of birth and my current city (no need to fix any of that, of course).","Facebook also seems to think that I was in the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment in the U.S. Army (nope), that I watch a lot of Channel 4 (which is in the United Kingdom), and that I'm a big fan of Undercover Boss (which I've seen maybe twice).","I really have no idea how these things popped up so high in my data. And to the extent I'm concerned about privacy, I hope that the bad data will obscure whatever correct info they actually have.","Pages, groups, and ads","Facebook lists an absurd number of pages and groups that I've become a fan of and joined; 376 pages and 89 groups. These are probably legit, even though I hardly remember most of them. It also illustrates just how many posts could potentially wind up in any person's feed at any time.","I'm also an administrator of 68 pages myself. That's a little misleading because I've created a lot of pages over the years that I never wound up developing, but I do work on a lot of pages for my day job, and I've got a few other side projects that involved Facebook pages, too.","The ads were almost more surprising: 34 advertisers supposedly have my contact information. But I don't care about many of them--two supermarket chains that doesn't have any stores anywhere near where I live, for example, and the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper in Australia.","In fact, the lesson I take away from this actually goes the other way: It makes me a little more concerned about all the money advertisers have all spent on Facebook ads over the years--because if the information they're showing about me is so inaccurate, who knows what the info on anyone I've been targeting is like?","So where does this leave Facebook in my eyes? The privacy issues are disturbing, for sure. But I have to admit, I enjoyed flipping through more than 10 years of photos and videos, some of which I hadn't thought of or seen in a very long time.","And despite all the recent revelations, I'm grateful that this thing exists, because it's how I first got back in touch with my college girlfriend, many years after we broke up. We'll be married five years soon. So I can understand #deletefacebook, but I probably won't delete Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas described Robicheaux and Riley as being \"clean-cut, good-looking people,\" and said they went looking for women at bars and festivals.

For starters, Cuomo said, he doesn't see Kavanaugh and Ford testifying about the alleged incident on Monday, as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) proposed.","\"This is about politics,\" Cuomo said. The FBI can — if President Trump allows it — and should investigate Ford's allegations, and Kavanaugh should want the feds to clear his name, Cuomo said. An FBI probe would bring a delay, and \"if it doesn't happen, if there is no FBI, if the president doesn't allow it, Monday goes away and this is a done deal,\" he predicted. Why? Republican voters and Trump's base showed in 2016 they were willing to overlook or discount credible sexual assault accusations by several women against Trump, Cuomo said, and given the choice between \"a generation of jurisprudence and having the rules of society reflect what they like, versus this woman and her accusation — if they swallowed so many like a bowl of ice cream, what do you think they'll do with just one?\" Trump, for what it's worth, seems to agree with Cuomo's assessment.

But Cambridge Analytica paid for it directly.\"","Cambridge Analytica appeared to lay the blame on Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), which is not associated with Cambridge University.","\"This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement issued Saturday.","\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" the statement added.","According to ITN Channel 4 News, Kogan said he held the right to use the data for commercial purposes and did nothing wrong.","Meanwhile, the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5 million to help target voters. The company told NBC News mere days before the 2016 election that it held data on 230 million American adults with approximately 4,000 “data points” on each of them.","The company denied, however, using any data that was harvested from Facebook via Kogan’s methods to help the Trump campaign.","\"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" the company added in Saturday's statement.","Facebook said in a statement that \"Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook.\" The social media provider added that Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan had told the company that all the data initially obtained by the app had been destroyed.","\"In light of new reports that the data was not destroyed, we are suspending these three parties from Facebook, pending further information,\" Facebook said. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties.\"","The social media company also insists that this did not constitute a data breach, as users technically consented — via their privacy settings — to allow Cambridge Analytica to harvest their data.","But Wylie does not think Facebook is completely innocent, as the social media giant first knew of the data gathering in 2015.","\"Why Facebook didn't, you know, make more enquiries when they started seeing that, you know, tens of millions of records were being pulled this way? I don’t know you’d have to ask Facebook that,\" Wylie said. \"But Facebook at least in a technical sense facilitated the project because they had applications that had these permissions in the first place.\"","According to Wylie, Facebook never checked that they had deleted the data, only requiring that Cambridge Analytica fill out a form.","And thanks to the lack of oversight, this influence-peddling company was able to \"move into the hearts and minds of American voters in a way that had never been done before.\"","And they did it in a way that entered a more than ethical grey area, according to Wylie, who claims they attempted to manipulate voters by latching onto their vulnerabilities.","\"This gets at the heart of, you know, why is it that you’re taking this psychological approach?\" he said. \"Why is it that you need to study things like shame proneness in people? Why do you need to, you know, study neuroticism in people? What’s going to make them fearful?\"","CORRECTION (March 17, 2018, 7:50 p.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the position Steve Bannon held in the Trump campaign.

You Weren't Reading Black Agenda Report | Black Agenda Report","text":["If the news that black Libyans and black migrants from sub-Saharan Africa were being sold as slaves in Libya was a surprise to you, then you were not reading Black Agenda Report during the 2011-2012 NATO intervention in that country. We covered it. Almost everybody refused to question US foreign policy in Africa during the reign of our first black president. Many US news outlets, many otherwise reasonable people with access to foreign news, and countless others around the world averted their eyes and their ears to the anguish of hunted, lynched and massacred black Africans in Benghazi, in Tripoli, in Sirte and Bani Walid. But as the US Navy and US Air Force unleashed thousands of tons of bombs and missiles on innocent civilians and the military forces of the Libyan government, without which Uncle Sam’s and Barack Obama’s racist rebels could never have toppled Muammar Gadaffi, you heard and read about it each week in Black Agenda Report.","That is, if you were listening to or reading Black Agenda Report.","This kind of unflinching coverage is the reason Black Agenda Report has been targeted by Google, which now suppresses the appearance of our content in its search results alleging that we are so-called “fake news\" or tools of the Russians. Of the roughly two dozen leftist publications singled out in this manner Black Agenda Report is the only one owned by blacks or oriented toward a black audience. There are slicker and prettier web sites with far larger audiences peddling other kinds of black experience and consciousness, profitably delivering black eyeballs to corporate marketers. These outlets do not challenge cherished beliefs. They neither question nor contradict the lies our corporate masters tell us, lies which some of us repeat to each other.","During the bloodletting in Libya Black Agenda Report carried accounts of responsible journalists and our own commentary in print, audio and video on the lynchings, the massacres and the politics behind them. Though many of these events were covered elsewhere on the African continent they were almost completely absent from US coverage of the Libyan crisis. Even DemocracyNow!, which had a correspondent on the ground and ran two, three or more Libya stories weekly for more than a year, only reported on the persecution of black Africans in Libya a handful of times with no followup. But Black Agenda Report helped give our audience a coherent picture of the US sponsored catastrophe that befell Libya in 2011 and 2012.","Since early 2011, Black Agenda Report has run about 60 articles on the Libyan crisis. You can find a list of their dates and authors and links to all these at the end of the print version of this article at BlackAgendaReport.com. They include audio coverage of a July 2011 Atlanta public report back in which former US Atty. General Ramsey Clark, former US Rep. Cynthia McKinney, Rev. Derrick Rice of Atlanta's Sankofa Church of God and others who recently returned from Libya recounted their experiences in that unhappy country, and richly sourced accounts of the reasons the US and NATO overthrew what was once the most prosperous nation on the African continent.","Apparently that’s what you do if you want the Washington Post and Google to name you as a purveyor of \"fake news\" and a tool of the Russians. You tell the truth without fear or favor. Frankly, it can be a bad business model.","In the face of suppression by the corporate owners of social media, Black Agenda Report needs your help to keep on delivering news, commentary and analysis from the black left.

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K.

Three months later, agents knocked on his door.","A spokesman for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement has resigned, saying that he could no longer “bear the burden” of spreading falsehoods on behalf of the Trump administration.","The spokesman, James Schwab, who had worked for the agency’s San Francisco Division, told news outlets Monday that his decision was prompted by false statements made by the agency on Feb. 27 and repeated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week.","The statements criticized the mayor of Oakland, Libby Schaaf, for her decision last month to warn city residents that a raid by federal immigration agents targeting roughly 1,000 people was imminent. The agency’s deputy director, Thomas D. Homan, said that Ms. Schaaf’s warning had helped “864 criminal aliens and public safety threats” to evade capture in the raid.","Mr. Sessions, in a visit to California last week, condemned Ms. Schaaf, a Democrat, and echoed the agency, asserting that her actions had allowed hundreds to escape.","Mr. Schwab said in interviews, first with The San Francisco Chronicle and then with CNN, that he had been frustrated by the remarks, and had quit “because I didn’t want to perpetuate misleading facts.”","“I asked them to change the information,” he told The Chronicle, referring to the 864 people to whom the statement alluded. “I told them that the information was wrong, they asked me to deflect, and I didn’t agree with that. Then I took some time and I quit.”","He explained that the enforcement agency would have been unlikely to capture all of the roughly 1,000 undocumented immigrants in the area that it had targeted, and that it was incorrect to identify those who were not detained as threats to public safety.","“We were never going to pick up that many people,” he said. “To say that 100 percent are dangerous criminals on the street, or that those people weren’t picked up because of the misguided actions of the mayor, is just wrong.”","Mr. Schwab did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. He resigned last week, according to CNN.","“I just couldn’t bear the burden — continuing on as a representative of the agency and charged with upholding integrity, knowing that information was false,” he told CNN, adding that in his 16 years of experience in government he had never been asked to deflect when he knew something was inaccurate.","In a statement, Ms. Schaaf, whom President Trump criticized last week for alerting residents to the raid, praised Mr. Schwab “for speaking the truth while under intense pressure to lie.”","“Our democracy depends on public servants who act with integrity and hold transparency in the highest regard,” she added.","An official at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, briefed on the plans for the raid said last month that agents find only about 30 percent of their targets on average during large sweeps.","Mr. Schwab told CNN that he thought Ms. Schaaf’s actions were “misguided,” but that blaming her “for 800 dangerous people out there is just false.”","ICE responded to Mr. Schwab’s comments in a statement, saying, “Even one criminal alien on the street can put public safety at risk.”","“As Director Homan stated, while we can’t put a number on how many targets avoided arrest due to the mayor’s warning, it clearly had an impact,” the statement said. “While we disagree with Mr. Schwab on this issue, we appreciate his service and wish him well.”","“If anyone wants to have a public argument over precisely how many dangerous criminal aliens eluded arrest because of the mayor’s irresponsible actions, we are happy to have that debate,” Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said in a statement.","In a 2016 interview, Mr. Schwab told The Marion Press, his hometown paper in Michigan, that he joined the Army after high school and was deployed to Korea for four years. His service lasted until 2005, according to his LinkedIn page, and he later joined the Department of Defense, where he became a public affairs specialist in 2011.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Uber says it is cooperating with a police investigation and has suspended testing of its self-driving vehicles in Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Toronto.","It is the first time a self-driving vehicle has killed a pedestrian, and the event is already causing some to question the pace at which the technology is moving. Besides Uber, dozens of companies, including established car makers and small startups, are rushing to test experimental self-driving vehicles and autonomous systems on roads. These efforts have received blessing from local governments because the technology seems so promising and because a driver is usually behind the wheel as a backup. A safety driver was in the front seat when the accident in Tempe occurred.","Though automated driving could ultimately save countless lives on roads, some say the technology is being deployed too quickly.","At a time when many have lauded the technology as ready for large-scale deployment, “this is clear proof that is not yet the case,” says Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at MIT who studies automated driving. “Until we understand the testing and deployment of these systems further, we need to take our time and work through the evolution of the technology,” he says.","The accident is unlikely to set a legal precedent, says Ryan Calo, who is researching the legal implications of vehicle autonomy at the University of Washington. Even if the victim is found to have been partly responsible, the company may also be liable, and it will be keen to settle in order to avoid a test case, he says.","Calo calls on those developing AI-based vehicles to think very carefully about the potential impact of their systems on human lives, and consider the legal and ethical implications.","The ethical questions surrounding self-driving cars—and especially a conundrum known as the “trolley problem,” which requires that a car choose between two potential victims in an accident—have confused the issue, he adds: “I don’t think the trolley-problem conversation has been at all helpful.” Of the accident that killed the woman in Arizona, he says, “The sensors probably didn’t pick her up, or the algorithm didn’t understand what it’s seeing.”","Sign up for the The Algorithm","News and views on the latest in artificial intelligence","Thank you — please check your email to complete your sign up.","Incorrect email format","By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters and\nnotifications from MIT Technology Review.

Research conducted by Reimer and others reinforces this point. Other research has shown the challenge of establishing communications between self-driving systems and pedestrians.","The accident comes amid what seemed like rapid progress on self-driving technology and a push to loosen legal restrictions. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet spun out of Google, announced late last year that it was taking the safety driver out of its vehicles and said it would launch a driverless taxi service in Phoenix later this year.","Just days ago, Waymo, Uber, and others had urged Congress to pass legislation that would pave the way for self-driving cars in the US. The accident will most likely slow the passage of that bill.","There have been a handful of accidents involving self-driving vehicles, including a crash in Florida in May 2016 involving a Tesla Model S in Autopilot mode that failed to see a truck across the road ahead. The Tesla’s driver was killed. Federal investigators have found the technology to be at fault in several of these accidents, but they have so far resisted the urge to implement stricter rules or halt testing altogether.","So far, the public has showed little sign of turning against the technology, even after such incidents. “I am not really sure this is going to lead to a public worry or backlash,” says Kambhampati. “Because honestly, I thought there would be more of a backlash after the Tesla accident.”","Share","Tagged","Will Knight is MIT Technology Review’s Senior Editor for Artificial Intelligence.

In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","Meanwhile, a New York Times story published Saturday claims the firm siphoned off information from the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission.","Despite Cambridge assuring Facebook the data were deleted – Facebook eventually received reports that the data was never disposed of.","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.","Cambridge Analytica founder Alexander Nix once boasted that his firm had collected as many as 5,000 data points on the 270 million likely American voters – a staggering number, according to Mother Jones.","Looking back, that admission may have been ill-advised: Cambridge Analytica is now embroiled in a lawsuit over whether they need to turn over the data they’ve collected on individual voters should those voters request it. This threatens to pull back the curtain on methods that the company used to help Trump win – including the rumored use of a technique called psychographics. Psychographics is a groundbreaking data-analysis technique that sounds like something adapted from a bad science-fiction novel.","Cambridge Analytica opened its doors in 2013 and claims to use big data to predict human behavior and influence political elections, according to the company’s website. But what sets Cambridge Analytica apart from other data firms is that it claims to use what’s known as psychographics to build its voter profiles. Many political campaigns have used demographics (e.g., age, race, gender) to target political messaging, and President Obama successfully and famously used consumer data to target voters. But psychographics, in theory, go deeper, claiming to be able to predict a voter’s personality traits, such as how organized, extroverted, or quick to worry they are, by looking at a person’s online and consumer behavior.","Representatives of the company have since tried to walk this back:","To add, even Cambridge Analytica itself is sending mixed messages about the use of psychographics on the Trump campaign. Nix said in that same fall 2016 presentation, “Of the two candidates left in the election, one of them is using these technologies,” referring to Trump. Then, at a December post-election panel hosted by Google, Matt Oczkowski, Cambridge’s head of product, said “I don’t want to break your heart; but we actually didn’t really do any psychographics with the Trump campaign.”","Cambridge Analytica said it’s in touch with Facebook in order to resolve the matter as quickly as possible​, according to a company statement on Saturday.","“No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,” the statement said.","The suspension comes as CA is embroiled in a lawsuit, brought by David Carroll, a media professor at Parsons School of Design, over whether it must turn over the data it has collected on American voters when they request it. While there are no US laws requiring this, CA, being a UK company, is subject to UK laws, that mandate disclosure.","Still, critics of CA have sought to portray the firm as a purveyor of psychological warfare that has actively tried to interfere in international elections. The company has been forced to repeatedly deny allegations that it conspired with Russia to sway the US election in favor of Trump – allegations that surfaced after it was revealed that Nix, the founder of CA, had offered Julian Assange help in releasing Hillary Clinton’s stolen emails.","The article, \"\"They Lied To Us\" - Facebook Suspends \"Psychological Warfare\" Firm That Backed Trump\", was syndicated from and first appeared at: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/tk3hhwun9lA/they-lied-us-facebook-suspends-psychological-warfare-firm-backed-trump.","You may find more great articles by Tyler Durden on http://www.zerohedge.com/fullrss2.xml/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/draghi/CBO%20August%201.png/%2A%7CFORWARD%7C%2A."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances, though the FTC's probe may extend to Facebook's compliance with U.S.-EU principles for transferring data.","Facebook said in a statement on Monday that the company remains \"strongly committed\" to protecting people's information and that it welcomes the opportunity to answer the FTC's questions.","Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, believes Facebook was in violation of the 2011 settlement in letting Cambridge Analytica harvest data on friends of Facebook users. He called the investigation \"good news.\"","\"This is what Facebook was doing 10 years ago that people objected to, what the FTC should have stopped in 2011,\" Rotenberg said. \"It makes zero sense that when a person downloads their apps, they have the ability to transfer the data of their friends.\"","Although Zuckerberg talked about changes in 2014 that would have prevented this, Rotenberg said it should have been banned already under the 2011 consent decree. He said the FTC had dropped the ball in failing to enforce that.","Meanwhile, state attorneys general asked Zuckerberg for an update on how Facebook will allow users to control the privacy of their accounts more easily.","\"Facebook has made promises about users' privacy in the past, and we need to know that users can trust Facebook,\" they wrote. \"With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.\"","In a statement, Facebook's vice president for state and local public policy, Will Castleberry, said the attorneys general \"have raised important questions and we appreciate their interest. Our internal review of the situation continues and we look forward to responding.\"","Facebook's stock, which already took a big hit last week, fell Monday after the FTC announcement but recovered by the end of the day. With Monday's close at $160.06, the stock is down almost 14 percent since March 16, when the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke."],"isopubdate":""}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale.","3 COMMENTS","Good whistle blower.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2pnALew?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.48c1b038fb93","title":"Everything you need to know about the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook debacle - The Washington Post","text":["Everything you need to know about the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook debacle","Late on Friday, Facebook made an unexpected announcement: The data firm Cambridge Analytica, hyped as integral to President Trump’s election, was suspended from the social network for using data collected improperly from Facebook users.","It is a complicated issue that many people might have missed, given the timing of the announcement. With that in mind, here is an overview of the groups involved, what happened — and what it means.","1. What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a data firm that promises its customers insights into consumer or voter behavior.","On the commercial side, that means tools like “audience segmentation” — breaking out advertising audiences into smaller groups — and then targeting advertisements to those groups on “multiple platforms.”","On the political side, it is much the same thing, with one tweak. While advertisers generally target consumers as groups, political campaigns need to target specific people — registered voters receptive to a potential message.","“Combining the precision of data analytics with the insights of behavioral psychology and the best of individually addressable advertising technology,” the company’s website pledges, “you can run a truly end-to-end campaign.” And that is why Cambridge Analytica was created.","Robert Mercer is a prominent conservative donor whose public profile rose sharply over the past few years. He and his daughter Rebekah invested millions in efforts to reshape conservative politics, funding Citizens United, the anti-mainstream-media Media Research Center and Breitbart News.","In 2013, Robert Mercer partnered with a British firm called SCL Group and its elections director Alexander Nix to test SCL’s methodology in Virginia’s governor’s race, as the New York Times reported. Their candidate, Republican Ken Cuccinelli, lost. But the Mercers moved forward with a political data strategy anyway, partnering with Nix to create Cambridge Analytica, which would use SCL’s data and methodology for political work.","2. What prompted the Facebook suspension?","The key part of the Cambridge Analytica sales pitch is that “insights of behavioral psychology” line.","There are lots of data companies that can tell you who’s registered to vote, and there are lots of companies that compile consumer data on those same voters. This, in fact, was an instrumental part of Facebook’s sales pitch to political campaigns (back before it quietly buried that pitch in the wake of questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election). After the 2014 election, we wrote about how Facebook offered campaigns a place to overlap their voter data (who’s registered and basic demographic information) with Facebook’s vast array of data on its users’ behavior. While most firms that collect data on consumer behavior do so by tracking the bread crumbs we leave around our consumer culture — grocery store rewards cards, magazine subscriptions, etc. — Facebook has the advantage that so many Americans tell the company precisely what they like, by quite literally clicking the “like” button.","Facebook’s database of personal information may be the largest in the world, given that nearly a third of the globe has an account with the company. If you are a company looking to provide data services, you would justifiably be jealous of the information Facebook possesses. So Facebook (recognizing an opportunity when it sees it) provides a way for software developers to build on top of their platform, allowing other companies to use their data under certain conditions. It used to be fairly trivial, in fact, for developers to build an application that would then pull a great deal of information from the site, including information about your friends’ activity. In May 2014, the site announced it was tightening that access, beginning the following year.","That change came slightly too late.","To apply its “insights of behavioral psychology” to national politics, as the Mercers intended, the SCL/Cambridge team needed a lot of information about a lot of Americans. According to the Times’s report, a Cambridge employee named Christopher Wylie encountered a researcher at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan built an application that leveraged Facebook’s tools to pull information from the site and then pitched its use using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a tool that allows developers to hire humans (sometimes then referred to as “turkers”) to do simple tasks for small fees.","“The task posted by ‘Global Science Research’ appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would ‘download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.’ ”","Global Science Research was Kogan. Using this method, he gathered information on tens of millions of Americans. (The Times says more than 50 million; other outlets say 30 million.) That information was then used to build out SCL/Cambridge Analytica’s profiles.","In building his Facebook application, Kogan had pledged that his data collection was only for research purposes and that it would remain anonymized — not able to be linked to specific people. When the Guardian reported in late 2015 on the link between Kogan and Cambridge, it prompted Facebook to promise to investigate the situation. (The Guardian’s story was pegged to Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) presidential campaign using Cambridge Analytica for its voter contact efforts. Cruz was strongly supported by the Mercers, who also created well-funded outside groups to promote his candidacy.)","In its statement on Friday announcing the suspensions, Facebook carefully put the blame on Kogan misusing its tools and explained it had demanded in 2015 that Kogan, SCL and Cambridge delete its Facebook data. The suspension was prompted by learning last week — apparently after being contacted by the Times — that Cambridge was still in possession of some of the Facebook data. (The company denies that.)","3. What does Cambridge Analytica’s data actually look like?","It is not clear, but we do have one hint.","A professor at New York’s New School named David Carroll was studying ad targeting when he realized Cambridge’s link with SCL meant the company might be subject to Britain’s broader data-access laws, allowing him to potentially see what data the company had collected on him. In March 2017, he got a response.","It is not clear how Cambridge/SCL developed that profile of Carroll (which he described on Twitter as “accurate”), but one can see how Facebook data might help inform those categories.","One can also see how, once the profile was developed, the Facebook data underlying it would become unnecessary. It is as though you sneaked a peek at the secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken and then developed your own recipe based on it. You may not be in possession of the recipe, but that is sort of beside the point.","4. Where does the Trump campaign fit into this?","Trump’s digital team was run by Brad Parscale, who last month was named campaign manager for Trump’s 2020 effort. Trump’s general election campaign was slow to get geared up after the primary, and, by mid-2016, there was a debate over how to invest in digital marketing. Bolstered by Parscale’s advocacy (and Jared Kushner’s championing) the campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, over then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s apparent objections. The decision may have been made easier, too, by Cambridge/SCL’s role in the successful Brexit campaign in Britain the same month.","As noted above, the Mercers had been hoping Cruz would be the Republican nominee. Once Trump won the Republican nomination, though, they shifted their focus. (The extent to which the hiring of Cambridge Analytica greased that transition is not clear.) They were reportedly instrumental in the August 2016 overhaul of Trump’s campaign, recommending the hiring of both Stephen K. Bannon (from Breitbart) and Kellyanne Conway, who had been working for one of their pro-Cruz PACs.","Over the last few months of the campaign, Parscale’s team invested heavily in Facebook advertising, even hosting a Facebook employee at their Texas war room who helped guide their work. The advertising the campaign deployed was informed by Cambridge Analytica’s data.","Bloomberg reported on the data team shortly before the election and how Parscale managed the competing data from Cambridge and the Republican Party.","“Parscale was building his own list of Trump supporters, beyond the RNC’s reach,” Bloomberg’s Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg wrote. “Cambridge Analytica’s statistical models isolated likely supporters whom Parscale bombarded with ads on Facebook, while the campaign bought up email lists from the likes of Gingrich and Tea Party groups to prospect for others.”","One footnote: Campaign adviser Michael Flynn also contracted with SCL shortly before the end of the campaign, though he apparently never did any work for the company.","5. Does this mean Trump won the election unfairly?","Well, this is a broader question: Does Cambridge help win elections? Or, put another way: How much of Cambridge’s rhetoric about psychographics is just hype?","6. Fine. Where has Cambridge Analytica won elections?","In most cases, it is very hard to identify one particular factor that made the difference in a political campaign. Despite the ubiquity of politicking, campaigns do not happen that often and, when they do, there are thousands of factors that make each contest unique. So analyzing the effects of campaign tactics means perusing a small sample in which we are asked to compare apples to oranges to grapes to dogs to stars to love to six.","This is hugely advantageous for political consulting firms because it is often hard to check their claims about how effective they are. Politicians are deeply superstitious and seize on their own and others’ past successes to guide their decisions moving forward. What’s more, the field of data-driven political persuasion is fairly new, meaning a company that can claim success in a realm many career politicians do not really understand has a huge marketing advantage. Say that you have cracked the code to targeting voters with specific messages, and a lot of campaigns will write you checks.","Cambridge Analytica has not been around that long, but they have been involved in several successful campaigns. There was Sen. Thom Tillis’s (R-N.C.) Senate campaign in 2014, which he won by 1.5 points. There was the “Leave” campaign in the United Kingdom in 2016 which won by 3.8 points. And there was Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.1 points but won the electoral college.","There were also losing campaigns. Before Trump, the highest-profile effort Cambridge undertook was Cruz’s — and he lost. Sure, he ended up in second place in the delegate count despite being fairly unpopular the year before, but his strategy was like Trump’s: leverage a core base of support to ride out a crowded field of candidates.","In June 2016, Politico reported that Cruz’s team “was disappointed in Cambridge Analytica’s services and stopped using them before the Nevada GOP caucuses in late February, according to a former staffer for the Texas Republican.”","So it is hard to say in the abstract the effect Cambridge might have had in Trump’s race — and it is harder still to say what role the laundered Facebook data played.","About a year after the election, Cambridge’s Nix said in an interview that his firm wasn’t able to leverage its psychographics on Trump’s behalf.","Here is Nix, speaking to TechCrunch:","“We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. … We had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitative psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.”","7. Is special counsel Robert S. Mueller III tracking this whole thing?","Apparently.","Given that the Trump campaign and Cambridge invested so much in targeting people online, and given that we know Russian actors tried to leverage Facebook ads and social media to influence voters, there is a natural question as to whether those two efforts had any coordination.","In July, McClatchy reported Mueller’s team was looking specifically at that.","“Congressional and Justice Department investigators are focusing on whether Trump’s campaign pointed Russian cyber operatives to certain voting jurisdictions in key states,” Peter Stone and Greg Gordon wrote. They quoted a former Pentagon staffer named Mike Carpenter. “There appears to have been significant cooperation between Russia’s online propaganda machine and individuals in the United States who were knowledgeable about where to target the disinformation,” Carpenter said.","8. So are there links to Russia?","Well, it depends on what you mean by “links.” We are in this weird moment where any even tangential link to Russia or a Russian person is heralded as a sign of questionable collusion.","So here is what we know.","The Times reports that SCL Group had spoken with the Russian oil giant Lukoil in 2014 and 2015, and that the company “was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.” (In an interview with the “Today” show on Monday, Wylie reiterated this claim.)","The paper also notes that Cambridge included questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 focus groups, though we will note this was also the time period in which Russia’s seizing of Crimea became central to American foreign policy conversations.","Late last year, the Daily Beast reported that Nix had contacted WikiLeaks’s Julian Assange before the election offering to host emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman to create a searchable database. Assange declined the offer. Those emails are believed to have been stolen by Russian hackers linked to the country’s intelligence agencies.","One other link is worth mentioning. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher who developed the tool that led to the Facebook suspension, had reportedly also received a grant from the Russian government to research social media.","“Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way,” Kogan told the Guardian."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Reserve your seat now!","At many publishers, community and engagement editors have long been pushing for a change in the newsroom culture away from superficial metrics toward a more authentic relationship with readers. Yet that culture shift was often impeded by the value and sheer size of the Facebook audience, whose reach, distributed audience and referral traffic publishers came to rely on to hit their analytics and advertising goals.","Well that particular barrier has fallen. And now is a good time to talk about better engagement metrics.","ADVERTISEMENT","When engagement is no longer defined as the total number of likes, reactions and shares by a aggregate audience and is instead an interaction with a particular reader of your website or publication, increasingly one you can identify by name, what are the best ways to measure that? A handful of recent examples point the way to a better set of measurement practices that rethink traditional digital analytics and refocus attention on key performance indicators.","Measuring New Engagement With Old Web Metrics","The return to loyal users is a return to traditional web metrics. But instead of page views and total unique users, publishers are using time on site and frequency of visit to take the measure of their web audience. Loyal users are more likely to seek out the site on their own, leading to the return of the home page as a priority for publishers. They are more likely to spend time on the site and more likely to come back more often. The bounce rate for a loyal audience will typically be lower than the bounce rate for users arriving from social media.","ADVERTISEMENT","These are metrics that have always been available to publishers but that have often been overlooked.","The product team at Vox has been using web analytics to measure and grow reader loyalty. As they rethink the on-site editorial experience for their readers post-Facebook, the team is looking at how to package content to show readers relevant articles and keep them on the site longer. “We definitely think about recirculation as a key metric across all our networks and as a way of understanding our users getting a lot of value out of this,” the head of Vox Media’s CMS, Mandy Brown, told Nieman Lab.","Recirculate! Vox Media’s new structure for story packages gives readers context — and helps them stick around https://t.co/EvNaFN278X","What about time per user? In a new set of recommended KPIs, or key performance indicators, for public media, time per user (or sessions per user, if time can’t be measured accurately) is offered as a key measure of engagement. The goal of audience engagement is to “encourage affinity, loyalty membership and advocacy,” write Steve Mulder of NPR and Mark Fuerst of Public Media Futures Forums in a piece on Current. Across websites, podcasts, streaming video and mobile apps, time per user could be a consistent starting point to measure success.","Yet there are important limits to web metrics when it comes to engagement. Most important, they only measure the activity of journalists indirectly, through content. They don’t directly measure what journalists do to engage with readers and communities. One KPI that missing from the public media recommendations, for example: How often organizations engage with their audiences, a suggestion made by The Coral Project on Twitter.","These are good – but we do wish that the 'Engage with our Audiences' KPIs contained at least one KPI around how often the orgs (and their journalists) engage with their audiences https://t.co/10OckMSGWh","Engagement metrics need to account for the increasingly “real people” aspect of engagement work. Community and engagement teams now find themselves managing and scaling relationships with individual users. Rather than an aggregate audience and reach on social media, publishers have print subscribers, members of Facebook group, sources and email newsletter readers. Editorial engagement can even be the cornerstone of an audience revenue program. Editorial engagement, “builds the practice of bringing readers’ concerns deeper within the [news] organization,” Emily Goligoski and Elizabeth Hanson wrote in a report for the Tow Center earlier this year.","This kind of engagement work with real people needs metrics that measure the direct work of journalists, not just the indirect effect, and the quality of engagement, not just the volume.","Take Facebook groups for example. With Facebook pages getting less attention from the News Feed algorithm, groups are a way for publishers to remain engaged with users. The Dallas Morning News invites its subscribers to join a private Facebook group, one of more than a handful overseen by engagement editor Hannah Wise. Its success is a measure of subscribers’ loyalty to the News. “A group seemed like a low-cost way to test if our subscribers even wanted to talk to us since they have habits built around joining Facebook groups, liking content and reacting in the comments,” Wise told Solution Set. Wise also edits the News’s Hearken-powered project, Curious Texas.","✨Professional Life Update✨I am thrilled the @dallasnews is creating a dedicated engagement team inside the audience team and I will be leading it.","We’ll focus on building community relationships online and offline. Some really great stuff is in the works. Watch this space 💖 pic.twitter.com/SHZhkhf9Z2","Publishers from The Texas Tribune to The Atlantic are also measuring engagement with Facebook Groups. “We started looking at groups because it allows for more community and more semblances of privacy and sharing experiences,” The Atlantic’s Caitlin Frazier told Digiday. Newsrooms can use Facebook’s Group Insights dashboard to understand how members engage, see the most active group members, and examine post-by-post engagement.","Operating in a similar community-centric model, local newsletter publisher WhereBy.Us also measures engagement by looking the work of its journalists.

The data included who the call was to or from, the date, time and duration. The calls were not made using Facebook or one of its apps, they were just the calls he'd made on his phone.","As the tweet went viral, other users replied that they were seeing their same call history recorded in the data.","On Sunday the social networking giant confirmed that it had been recording the call history, and attempted to tamp down some of the criticism by emphasizing that the affected users had opted in to the process.","\"Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android,\" the company wrote. \"This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook.\"","Once enabled, the Messenger app begins \"to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history.\"","A screenshot provide by Facebook of the \"continuously upload\" contact opt-in screen on Messenger for Android.Facebook","Facebook stressed it didn't sell the data and doesn't record the text messages or the audio of the calls themselves.","It didn't say how many users had their history recorded.

Facebook reports quarterly financial results on Wednesday, July 29, 2015. (AP Photo/Jeff ... more >","The near-hysterical reaction to the Trump campaign’s reported use of personal Facebook data in 2016 ignores a fact of life about social media: businesses, platforms and political campaigns have been collecting users’ personal preferences for years through a variety of online tools to reach their target audiences.","This alleged data “breach” from Facebook accounts is not identity theft, in which hackers try to steal your credit card information, Social Security number or bank account. The accusation leveled against the voter-profiling research firm Cambridge Analytica involves the exploitation of Facebook users’ personal choices and “likes” — expressed online voluntarily for their friends to see — that let researchers and analysts make educated guesses about a person’s political leanings and susceptibility to advertising.","“This sounds scary to a lot of people because the name ‘Trump‘ is attached to it,” Republican digital strategist Patrick Ruffini said. “In reality, this was being done first by the Obama campaign in 2012 and subsequently by other Republican campaigns. This is no different than what Obama did, and no different than what other campaigns and companies have done.”","He said the data collection “was the equivalent of downloading someone’s Twitter follower list.”","Facebook said Monday that it had hired a firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by the Trump campaign, and the whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who accused Cambridge of misusing the data.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” Facebook said in a statement. “We remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Mr. Wylie said the data were first collected by Russian-American academic researcher Aleksandr Kogan through an app called This Is Your Digital Life,” which asked users to answer questions voluntarily for a psychological profile. By default, the app’s privacy settings allowed its developers to access users’ Facebook information, such as their hometowns and whether they “like” the game “Angry Birds” or the movie “The Shawshank Redemption.”","Cambridge is accused of gathering users’ data without their explicit consent in 2014 and 2015 from Mr. Kogan, in violation of Facebook policies.","“Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford the firm complete access to their servers and systems,” Facebook said. “We have approached the other parties involved — Christopher Wylie and Aleksandr Kogan — and asked them to submit to an audit as well. Mr. Kogan has given his verbal agreement to do so. Mr. Wylie thus far has declined.”","Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica last week for what it says is a violation of its policies.","The personal choices expressed on social media, along with a list of the users’ online “friends,” can be used by analysts to develop a personality profile of someone with a Facebook account. From there, users’ names can be matched against voter rolls to create a list of likely voters to reach through advertising in a presidential election.","Cambridge Analytica, formerly led by ex-White House strategist Steve Bannon, denies that it used any Facebook data for the Trump campaign in 2016. The firm says it deleted all the information when it learned that the academic researcher shouldn’t have sold the data to the company.","“This isn’t a spy movie,” the company said on Twitter. “We’re a data analytics company doing research & analysis on commercial, public and data sets for clients.”","Lawmakers are calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to explain what happened.","Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat, and John Kennedy, Louisiana Republican, called on the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday to hold a hearing with tech company CEOs to examine what they are doing to protect online data.","“The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights,” the senators wrote.","Consumer advocates are noting that Facebook didn’t notify the affected users for two years. Others are questioning whether Facebook users have had their privacy invaded.","“I think Facebook users should be deeply concerned,” said Patrick Hynes, president of the online communications firm Hynes Communications in Washington. “They have been given all kinds of public assurances that this wasn’t going to happen to their data. And they accepted a social media environment that said they’re going to be served ads based on their preferences, but that their personal information was never going to be given to any outside entity that would then use that information for ad sales or psychological profiling or any other kind of third-party activity. This violates the ‘contract’ that we have with Facebook.”","Mr. Ruffini, a former Republican National Committee strategist who runs the digital analytics firm Echelon Insights, said companies conduct similar kinds of online market research constantly.","“It’s no different than what companies every day are doing to figure out, based on available data points about you, to model out whether you’re going to buy a car,” Mr. Ruffini said. “Those things happen on the internet every day. Hundreds of people are doing this to you right now.”","Democrats, overlooking the fact that President Obama’s re-election campaign pioneered data mining of social media to reach voters younger than 30, see a sinister development in the Trump campaign’s reported use of the information.","Rep. James A. Hines, Connecticut Democrat and a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which has interviewed Mr. Bannon, said he cannot believe that a company formerly run by Mr. Bannon and owned by wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer would not have exploited the Facebook data to Mr. Trump’s advantage.","“That work was used,” Mr. Himes said Monday on CNN. “By whom, and exactly when, I’m not sure. [But] that work was used.”","Cambridge Analytica said Mr. Obama’s 2008 campaign “was famously data-driven, pioneered microtargeting in 2012, talking to people specifically based on the issues they care about.”","That statement prompted a former Obama campaign official, Jeremy Bird, to fire back on Twitter that Cambridge is accused of stealing data on 50 million Facebook users.","“That’s not ‘data-driven,’” Mr. Bird tweeted. “That’s theft. Do not use the Obama campaign to justify your shady business.”","Some congressional Democrats are pouncing on the development as another possible indication that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, sent a letter to Mr. Wylie on Monday inviting him to testify before the panel’s Democrats about Cambridge Analytica’s use of the Facebook data.","“The company has repeatedly touted its ability to influence voters through ‘psychographic’ targeting and has claimed it was the fundamental reason that Donald Trump won the 2016 election,” Mr. Schiff said. “Indeed, it may be that through Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign made use of illegitimately acquired data on millions of Americans in order to help sway the election.”","Mr. Schiff said Mr. Kogan’s Russian background “raises further questions, which the committee must investigate.”"],"isopubdate":""}

Let me restate that to make it absolutely clear: Facebook tracked your phone call dates and times, logs of when you messaged people, and actual contact numbers with names.","Why, exactly, this information is tracked is part of the company's marketing witches brew, perhaps related to selling those bits of data to folks like Cambridge Analytica, which collected information on 50 million Facebook users before the last U.S. presidential election in an effort to help paying clients win.","Another reason Facebook keeps that data is because it uses that contact information to make friend recommendations on its site. If you've ever wondered why your ex's friends, your hairdresser or your psychologist shows up as a friend suggestion, there you have it.","In response to an email inquiry by Ars Technica about this data gathering, a Facebook spokesperson stated, \"The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.\"","Infographics show the classes and anxieties in the supposedly classless U.S. economy.","For those of us who follow politics, we’re used to commentators referring to the President’s low approval rating as a surprise given the U.S.'s “booming” economy. This seeming disconnect, however, should really prompt us to reconsider the measurements by which we assess the health of an economy. With a robust U.S. stock market and GDP and low unemployment figures, it’s easy to see why some think all is well. But looking at real U.S. wages, which have remained stagnant—and have, thus, in effect gone down given rising costs from inflation—a very different picture emerges. For the 1%, the economy is booming. For the rest of us, it’s hard to even know where we stand. A recent study by Porch (a home-improvement company) of blue-collar vs. white-collar workers shows how traditional categories are becoming less distinct—the study references \"new-collar\" workers, who require technical certifications but not college degrees.

People are outraged by how their personal data has been mined through Facebook, used to profile them, and then leveraged to influence others in matters of great importance - all without their knowledge or consent.","It came to light that academic Aleksandr Kogan had created a personality quiz on Facebook, something most app developers do at some stage in their career. What most don’t do however, is harvest the data and sell it on to third parties, in this case Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm heavily involved in US and UK political campaigns. It’s not just the 270,000 people who accepted the terms of this “personality quiz”, to allow Global Science Research (GSR) access to their personal data, who feel tricked. It’s one thing that their data was sold on to Cambridge Analytica, but what about the further 50 million people connected to the 270,000 whose data was harvested and sold via the same method?","Now, whether various terms and conditions between Facebook, its users, Cambridge Analytica, and any other third parties make all this legal is a matter for the lawyers, pending an investigation in both the UK and US. But in the world of data analytics, consumer privacy is a companion in any of the work that we at Ecovis do as practitioners, and there is a line that can be crossed without the correct culture and ethical framework. Regardless of the terms, the uproar alone is probably enough to say that the line has been crossed.","The truth is that companies know more about us as customers than perhaps we realise, and certainly more than ever before. In general, we benefit from this; the communication we receive is more relevant to us, offers are more tailored to our needs, supermarkets stock more of the products we like, retailers stop sending us catalogues when we’re clearly not interested. Even customer feedback can now be “mined” en masse, to understand themes in the customer base. Problems in customer experience are identified and rectified, and companies can identify issues of growing importance to act on, such as a visible commitment to corporate and social responsibility.","While the Facebook scandal certainly strikes us as immoral, soon it will also be illegal in the EU, and following Brexit, will continue to be illegal in the UK. With the advent of GDPR in May 2018, we know that power is being given to the people. Companies must explicitly request permission and be granted consent to use or process our personal data for any purpose other than what’s necessary to carry out their business (a “necessary” example, the shipping address to send our goods!). We can withdraw our consent at any time, and companies are required to permanently delete our data in that case.

Through our data analytics service, we are helping our clients to realise immense value from their company data and helping to change the way their business is carried out. In doing so, Ecovis continue to make sure our moral and ethical obligations are fulfilled.","The use of data to companies is powerful and financially valuable, allowing businesses to optimise costs, recognise the needs of their customers (and service them) and dramatically increase their return on marketing investment.

FEC documents show that between October 3 and October 19 of the same year Make America Number 1 paid out $323,908 to Cambridge Analytica — $20,000 of which was for \"DATA ACQUISITION SERVICES.\"","Remember, this is after Facebook discovered Cambridge Analytica had been in possession of ill-gotten Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica told Facebook it had deleted that data when Facebook instructed it to, but recent reports indicate at least some of the data wasn't deleted.","Was Thiel unaware of what the Super PAC was doing with its money? Maybe. Is Thiel a reckless investor who doesn't first do due diligence? You tell me.","Now, in his role as a Facebook board member, Thiel likely did not know the details about the shady goings-on at Cambridge Analytica. However, the fact that he co-founded Palantir — itself a data analysis firm — suggests he isn't naive about what a company like Cambridge Analytica could do with data profiles on 50 million Facebook users.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

If we can’t, we don’t deserve it,” said the advertisement, which appeared in plain text on a white background with a tiny Facebook logo.","The world’s largest social media network is coming under growing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States, and is trying to repair its reputation among users, advertisers, lawmakers and investors.","This follows allegations that the British consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to users’ information to build profiles of American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.","U.S. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press” on Sunday that Facebook had not been “fully forthcoming” over how Cambridge Analytica had used Facebook data.","Warner repeated calls for Zuckerberg to testify in person before U.S. lawmakers, saying Facebook and other internet companies had been reluctant to confront “the dark underbelly of social media” and how it can be manipulated.","“BREACH OF TRUST”","Zuckerberg acknowledged that an app built by a university researcher had “leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014”.","“This was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time,” Zuckerberg said, reiterating an apology first made last week in U.S. television interviews.","The Reuters/Ipsos online poll found that 41 percent of Americans trust Facebook to obey laws that protect their personal information, compared with 66 percent who said they trust Amazon.com Inc, 62 percent who trust Alphabet Inc’s Google, 60 percent for Microsoft Corp.","The poll was conducted from Wednesday through Friday and had 2,237 responses.

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","\"I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,\" said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the \"maximum exposure\" could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more - likely in the tens of millions - because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user's list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend's demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","\"They say 'trust us,' but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement.","Rep. Adam Schiff, Calif., the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","\"I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,\" Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. \"There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms.\"","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union's justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","\"I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,\" Collins said Sunday. \"It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.\"","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","\"We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,\" Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, said in the statement. \"That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information.\"","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a \"breach\" of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook's request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor's role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook's privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica's app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ecree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, \"We've heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.\" That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend's data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday, \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, \"bespeaks the same recklessness with its users' data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.\"","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","\"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,\" Rich said. \"They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.\"","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users' sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users' friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users' explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers' consent before \"enacting changes that override their privacy practices,\" the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","\"This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission's failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,\" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can't do the job.\"","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla., also criticized Facebook on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"","\"Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they're above the rules that apply to everybody else,\" Rubio said.","(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Billed as a research vehicle for psychologists, the app, downloaded by approximately 270,000 people, asked them to share things such as content they had liked and the city they’d listed on their Facebook profile.","The social network says that Kogan passed the information to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies in violation of its rules. When it discovered this in 2015, it removed the app and asked Kogan, SCL/Cambridge Analytica, and Wylie to certify they had destroyed the data collected. All three parties said they had done so.","But according to its post, Facebook recently received reports that not all the information had been deleted. The social network says it’s looking into these claims and is suspending Kogan, Wylie, and SCL/Cambridge Analytica pending further information.","But wait, there’s more: In a related story on March 17, the New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica collected private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without permission, in what it described as “one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.” The story cites documents and former employees, including on-the-record statements from Wylie.","Why this matters: The use of social media to target political messages during the 2016 election has caused plenty of controversy. Facebook’s move will be seen as a sign it’s taking seriously accusations that it was used to manipulate public opinion, but it also raises the question of whether other data was siphoned off without the network’s knowledge."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Being affordable, that means that, unlike other high throughput platforms, MinION technology is available to a wider user base - helping us to democratise (and open-source) biology.","We asked Sebastian Cocioba, biohacker and molecular florist, about what got him into biohacking, and how he is using the MinION, among other things, to help open-source biology and to educate and equip the next generation of budding biologists.","Sebastian is one of a growing community of people who adore biology, but have had a slightly different journey into exploring the essence of life than the usual bachelor’s, master’s, PhD, postdoc route. We asked him how he became a biohacker, what he’s doing with MinIONs and next generation sequencing, among other things, and how we can help inspire, educate and equip a new generation of biologists with the tools to increase scientific literacy.","What does biohacking mean to you?","Biohacking is the tinkering and modification of biological systems through conventional and unconventional means, typically in an informal setting, such as home labs, garage labs and community hackerspaces.","How did you get into biohacking?","I’ve always been interested in plants and have been diving deeper and deeper into the biological aspect of plants, especially floral morphology and physiology. One day I stumbled upon the concept of genetic engineering with plants and began collecting the resources and knowledge of how to do this, mainly on the internet and google forums.","As my interest grew, so too did my home lab. I collected lab equipment off eBay in various states of disrepair and taught myself a bit of electrical engineering. I fixed what seemed like a dead unit bought for $40 and brought it back to working order with a new value exceeding $2000.","After several years, I built up a fully functional genetic engineering laboratory in the 3rd bedroom of my mom’s apartment; capable of doing everything from general molecular biology to genetic engineering and recently I added Next Generation Sequencing to my lab’s wheelhouse of skills.","Imagine a world where school children sequence one of the 400,000 plant species on this planet as part of their studies and get direct scientific attribution at an early age.","Can you describe yourself and your not-for-profit organisation?","I am a 26 year old college dropout with no formal degree working on various contract research projects for institutions like the MIT Media Lab and School of Visual Arts in the comfort of my home laboratory.","I am also on the board of directors for my non-profit organization, Binomica Labs, where we develop discovery-driven research-based curricula for students of middle and high school. They answer small scientific questions and get direct attribution for their work, as well as training for peer review through our internal group of established research scientists.","Our goal is to help students of all ages publish in peer reviewed journals through self-driven, novel research projects they are directly interested in. Science is the practical extension of natural human curiosity and we wish to harness this intrinsic trait through more hands-on learning focused on the generation of new knowledge.","What’s your favourite project?","The one I find most interesting is the Decentralized Oxalis Genome Project. We are sequencing the cosmopolitan weed Oxalis stricta as a means of developing a biohacker-driven pipeline for genomics of otherwise orphaned organisms which academia has no immediate interest in sequencing or studying.","Every participant provides a small amount of reliable sequencing data via traditional sanger sequencing based on a draft reference genome we produce in our amateur home labs. The result will be another fully sequenced plant genome and also the framework for other hackerspaces to do the same.","The ultimate goal is to get the project into the school curriculum. Imagine a world where school children sequence one of the 400,000 plant species on this planet as part of their studies and get direct scientific attribution at an early age. They can use this as an example of real world experience of independent research. Imagine applying to university (or a PhD) with three publications under your belt?","Do you think projects such as yours can increase the openness of science?","Certainly! By allowing the general public to take part in the pursuit of new knowledge we gain a collective increase in scientific literacy and can open new potential collaborations with formal institutions. The increase in generation and sharing of this new data will only reinforce the need for openness and provide future generations with an established framework for open genomics and research in general.","If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe - Carl Sagan","What interests you in genomics, specifically?","Since I mainly do genetic engineering research, in order to modify the organism in any meaningful way I must first have a clear map of its genetic blueprint. It would be unscientific of me to tinker in the dark and expect to generate any meaningful data without a map to guide me.","Why the MinION?","It’s the only whole genome sequencing platform I can afford that is free of any investment or initial capital contracts. Truly a personal genome sequencing device that is portable and anyone can use effectively.","The added benefit of nanopore technology is the long read capabilities. When you do not have a reference genome to align your sequence with, having the benefit of long contiguous reads can drastically decrease the computational overhead to produce genomic maps of any acceptable quality.","Due to the nature of nanopore tech, you can also sequence otherwise impossible regions of genomic DNA like centromere zones where conventional sequencing, which relies on PCR based methods, are rendered useless. Ultra long stretches of repeats are no match for the MinION so there is an abundance of added value aside from the accessibility of the device to relative novices such as myself.","It gives me a comprehensive report on not just the integrity of the data generated by the nanopore but on the sequencing run itself. This will give me vital feedback when designing my next set of nanopore experiments. The data garnered using this program makes every subsequent flow cell run better and better.","Would you say you benefit from open source tools developed in academic institutions?","ABSOLUTELY!!!! Without these tools it would be impossible for me to conduct next generation whole genome sequencing at home. Data is useless if you can’t use it and these tools allow me to take the raw information and curate it into new knowledge.","I owe my career to the developers of these tools and wish to one day pay it forward by contributing my own set of tools for future researchers, especially those in situations similar to myself, to conduct their projects with greater efficiency and less aches of head and heart.","What obstacles do you face in your research?","The largest obstacle has been the computational requirements for generating alignments of large genomic datasets using household computer systems. The RAM requirements alone would set me back tens of thousands. Luckily there are things like Amazon AWS instances which allow for rental of computing clusters, but I do deeply envy institutions with readily accessible supercomputer systems.","Hopefully with the recent upsurge in graphics cards purchased by machine learning and bitcoin mining endeavors, the price will lower and more will begin to utilize the immense parallel processing capabilities of gaming graphics cards.","Aside from computational limitations, the actual datasets generated are too big to share with my friends easily. I’d have to burn several bluray disks to transfer the near terabyte of genomic raw data from our nanopore runs.","What is life like for an ardent biohacker?","My situation is a little unique since my focus is not on forming a startup or living forever but rather conducting good scientific research… at home! There is a quiet comfort in having your lab a mere 10 feet away from your bedroom. Those surprisingly common bursts of inspiration do not require a hour long commute to a university lab in the middle of the night. Just wake up, set up a PCR reaction, go back to bed, wake in the morning and run a gel. Days blend into one another but the ability to manipulate nature in your PJs is worth every sacrifice.","Days blend into one another but the ability to manipulate nature in your PJs is worth every sacrifice.","What do you envisage for the future of biology, and biohacking?","For science to become recognized as the deeply universal human activity it has always been. I wish for biohackers to commune with formal academics and for there to be no line of discrimination between the abilities of the amateur with respect to research. Credit where credit is due and a meritocracy based collaboration. I wish for science to be as commonplace as entertainment and casual hobbies.","There is so much we have yet to discover and learn about our planet and we are only beginning to scratch the surface. Biohacking can not only provide the biotech industry with feedstock for new innovations but also accademia with more leads to follow.","By essentially being the custodians of orphaned organisms, we become the first responders for conservation work, invasive species understanding, and new ideas in basic research.","Science education is so important, and people like you are an inspiration. How can we help inspire the next generation of biohackers?","By proving that we can punch above our weight, if given a chance.","By establishing precedence, we gain the trust of institutions so that opportunities can be given to anyone as long as they show passion, dedication, and perseverance despite inevitable failures and setbacks.","The public perception of science is that only the intellectual elites can generate new knowledge… which is categorically and objectively untrue.","How do you think biohacking can help to increase scientific literacy?","To be literate in science one must practice science much like literacy in reading means practicing to read. As the technological and financial barriers decrease, more and more people can dive directly into research in the comfort of their homes.","My wish is to not stop at mere literacy but reach for the moonshot of global scientific eloquence.","If we are to play god, let us be responsible gods and learn to respect and understand the power each subsequent generation will have in shaping our world and beyond.","What would you say to an aspiring biohacker, ready to launch themselves into the world of scientific research?","Start with a question...and let it consume your body and soul. Find a topic you are interested in and narrow it down to a question you are curious and passionate about understanding. Then, catch up on all the published literature in that respective field until you are at the bleeding edge of our understanding.","Meanwhile verse yourself in the philosophy of science as well as the theory of experimental design. Once you have all that under your belt, the next steps will be self evident. Immerse yourself in your field of interest. Reach out to authors, go to conferences, visit biohacker spaces and community labs, talk to professors of local universities...and never ever give up.

The company is facing multiple privacy investigations in the U.S. and U.K. over the leak of personal information pertaining to as many as 60 million Facebook users to voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica (see Probes Begin as Facebook Slammed by Data Leak Blowback).","Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged last week to improve privacy protections and be more transparent with users. The latest findings, however, suggest a deeper disconnect between what Facebook stores and what users expected the site to gather.","The privacy uproar over Cambridge Analytica has led some users to download their Facebook archive, a rich repository of personal information the site has cataloged. Over the last several days, those archives have yielded data users have found surprising.","Some archives show contact information that Facebook has collected from mobile phone address books. Other information included detailed call logs, such as to whom a call was made for how long and records of SMS messages. The information is metadata - data pertaining to other data, in this case concerning details of transmissions; but it does not include the content of those calls or communications.","Permission Granted?","Facebook maintains that it has always asked for permission for that kind of information, but some users say they never granted permission. The situation gained steam after a tweet last Wednesday from Dylan McKay, a software developer and student in Wellington, New Zealand.","He found call logs for every chat he had with his partner's mother between 2016 and last year. McKay has created an informal survey that's so far gathered about 1,000 responses on what type of metadata people have found in their Facebook archives.","McKay's tweet prompted others to dig around their Facebook archives. Emma Kennedy, a London-based author, writes on Twitter that she never granted permission for Facebook to collect the data she found.","I've just looked at the data files I requested from Facebook and they had every single phone number in my contacts. They had every single social event I went to, a list of all my friends (and their birthdays) and a list of every text I've sent.","\"They have plundered my phone,\" Kennedy writes in another tweet. \"They have phone numbers of people who aren't on Facebook. They have phone numbers of household names who, I'm sure, would be furious to know their phone numbers are accessible. I'm appalled.\"","Only Android Affected","It appears the surprise call logs are only showing up for Facebook users on Android devices. Apple has never allowed developers access to call logs or SMS data on iOS, in large part for security reasons, but it does allow access to the address book. Apple officials in Sydney did not have an immediate comment.","Facebook addressed the latest controversy in a blog post on Sunday. The logging of calls and text history has been an opt-in feature in Messenger since 2015 and in Facebook Lite.","Facebook Lite was launched in 2015. It's aimed at developing markets and uses less data than the full-fledged app. The company only made it available last week to users in the U.S., Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand.","Suspicion Centers on Android Messenger App","It doesn't appear that the people who are complaining that their contacts have been uploaded to Facebook and calls logged would have been able to use Facebook Lite. Hence by process of elimination, that appears to make Facebook's Messenger app the culprit.","Facebook asserts that users have always been asked for their permission. Aside from other technical explanations that have yet to emerge, that means if Facebook's characterization is accurate, forgetful memories may have fueled an unjustified outcry.","However, the publication Ars Technica suggests a different possible scenario, rooted in Android's historical permissions settings, may have occurred.","The Google-developed Android operating system allows users to give permissions to apps for certain functions. When someone downloads an app, the app asks if it is allowed to access certain data or functionality, such as a phone's camera or microphone, contacts or other information.","Over the years, as some apps became more aggressive or deceptive and security concerns emerged, Android began offering more fine-grained access permissions. But in versions of Android 4.1 and prior, granting access to a phone's contacts list also granted access to call and message logs by default, Ars reports.","That means that Facebook - when asking for contacts information - could have also received the call and SMS metadata. The permission structure, however, was changed in version 16 of the Android API.","But Ars Technica reports that Android apps could get around the change by writing to the old version of the API. The old version of the API, 4.0, was only deprecated in Android last October, it adds.","When asked about the Ars Technica report, Facebook maintains that it has always asked for permission to log call and text history even if Android did not. The company provided screen shots of the current advisories that are displayed by Android after Messenger is installed.","These are the current advisories displayed by Android after someone installs Facebook's Messenger.","While the Android advisory windows do describe some of the behaviors that Messenger would be allowed to do with contacts, calls and SMS messages, it doesn't state that the data will be stored on Facebook's servers. However, Facebook is more direct in its advisory.","The feature is headlined \"Text anyone in your phone\" and then says it will \"continuously upload info about your contacts like phone numbers and nicknames, and your call and text history.\"","Facebook's disclosure in Messenger","Questions Remain","ISMG asked Facebook if Ars Technica's theory is the reason for why users are surprised, and also asked if Facebook could clarify how it asked for permissions for past versions of the full Facebook mobile app and Messenger, but it did not receive a reply.","Asking for access to a mobile phone's address book is common among app developers because it is used to match a new user with other people they know and who use the same app. The key in this situation, however, is whether Facebook has been clear enough with users over how much data it has been collecting.","In its blog post, Facebook says it does not share call or SMS metadata with third parties.","It is possible for users to delete contacts data the social network has collected. Also, in Messenger, users can turn off a menu item that continuously uploads new contact information to the company.","Facebook also says it is possible to turn off the setting that syncs a person's call and text history.

Still, it has some genuine usefulness. And while the single best way to keep your privacy safe on Facebook is to delete your account, taking these simple steps in the settings is the next best thing.","Remember, it's not just friends of friends you need to think about hiding from; it's an army of advertisers looking to target you not just on Facebook itself, but around the web, using Facebook's ad platform. In the video above and the post below, we'll show you how to deal with both.","Fine-Tuning Friends","Limiting who can see which of your posts is an easy first step. On a desktop, go to the little dropdown arrow in the upper-right corner, and click Settings. From there, click on Privacy on the left-hand side. This is where the magic happens.","Under Who can see my stuff, click on Who can see your future posts to manage your defaults. You can make public to anyone at all, limited to your friends, or exclude specific friends. You can quarantine your posts by geography, or by current or previous employers or schools, or by groups. Just remember that the next time you change it, the new group becomes the default. So double check every time you post.","This section has other important privacy tools you can fiddle with, including who can look you up with your email address or phone number. We'd recommend not listing either in the first place, but if you do, keep the circle as small as possible. (If you do have to share one or the other with Facebook for account purposes, you can hide them by going to your profile page, clicking Contact and Basic Info, then Edit when you mouse over the email field. From there, click on the downward arrow with two silhouettes to customize who can see it, including no one but you.)","But pay special attention to the option to (deep breath) Limit the audience for posts you’ve shared with friends of friends or public? If you ever had a public account, taking it private wasn't retroactive. If you want to hide those previously viewable posts, lock this setting down.","Over on Timeline and Tagging you can control over what shows up on your own Facebook timeline. Basically, you can’t stop your friends from tagging you (sorry!), but you can stop those embarrassing photos from popping up on your page. At the very least, you should go to Review posts you’re tagged in before the post appears on your timeline, and enable that so that you can screen any tags before they land on your page.","To test out your changes, go to Review what other people see on your timeline. You can even see how specific people view your page, like your boss or your ex or complete strangers. It also never hurts to take stock of you present yourself to the world. (Looking at you, people who haven't updated your cover photo since the Obama administration.)","That should about cover your friends. Now onto advertisers, which are like friends, except they never leave you alone, even if you ask nicely.","Ad It Up","In that same Settings panel, head down to Ads. As you probably realized, Facebook knows what you do pretty much everywhere online. So does Google, so do dozens of ad networks you’ve never heard of. You're being tracked pretty much all the time, by everyone, thanks to this here internet.","You can still limit how Facebook uses that information, though. Tired of that lawnmower you looked at following you to Facebook? Turn off Ads based on my use of websites and apps. Saying no to Ads on apps and websites off the Facebook companies does the same, except for all the sites Facebook serves ads to around the web. Which is most of them.","Lastly, for some fun insight into how advertisers think of you, click on Your Interests. There you’ll find all the categories Facebook uses to tailor ads for you. You can remove any you don’t like, and marvel at the ones that don’t make any sense. This won't make the ads go away, but it'll at least you can banish all those off-brand kitchen gadgets from your News Feed.","And you’re good! Or at least, as good as can be expected. It’s still Facebook, after all."],"isopubdate":"2017-11-14"}

And that paralysis is, remarkably quickly, leading people to reassess their relationship with the site as a whole. The teens got there first, really. Facebook usage among younger people has been declining for years, in the face of competition from upstart rivals such as Snapchat, internal disruption from Facebook-owned Instagram, and a general sense that Facebook is full of old people and parents. But the backlash isn’t a generational thing any more. We’re all losing control of our data, both online and off, and we’re starting to kick back.","Not only is the burgeoning #deletefacebook movement picking up steam (although it will take a few weeks before hard numbers are available about how many have followed through on their words), but people are also beginning to look up, as if from a daydream, to ask: how exactly did we end up in this situation? Why did we give up our privacy so willingly? And how can we get it back?","The Guardian view on big tech: a new era needs new rules | Editorial","Read more","The 50m profiles harvested from Facebook by a Cambridge Analytica partner under the guise of research are a huge data store, but they pale in comparison with the amount of information the company holds on its own users. At the same time that Facebook turned off the spigot that had been used to pump industrial quantities of data off its platform, the company opened up a second set of floodgates: the Facebook Audience Network, which allows third parties to track, profile and advertise to Facebook users wherever they find them on the internet.","Facebook isn’t really a social network. It’s barely even an advertising company. It’s a data analytics firm, which manages to use its position as the middleman for a vast proportion of all human communication to find out everything there is to know about its users.","Just as Cambridge Analytica claimed enormous powers of perception with a scant selection of personal information, Facebook also boasts to advertisers about how much it knows about its users – and how effective it can be at influencing their minds: it cites a games company that “made video adverts to match different gamer styles” for a “63% increase in purchase intent”; a clothes retailer that achieved “a dramatic increase in sales” with “richly personalised ads”; and a mobile network that scored “a major boost in awareness and purchase intent” by focusing on users with families. (Facebook used to have a similar page on which it showed off to politicians about how effective it was at swinging elections, but it quietly removed that in February.)","If you think you’re a passive user of Facebook, minimising the data you provide to the site or refraining from oversharing details of your life, you have probably underestimated the scope of its reach. Facebook doesn’t just learn from the pictures you post, and the comments you leave: the site learns from which posts you read and which you don’t; it learns from when you stop scrolling down your feed and how long it takes you to restart; it learns from your browsing on other websites that have nothing to do with Facebook itself; and it even learns from the messages you type out then delete before sending (the company published an academic paper on this “self-censorship” back in 2013).","Facebook boasts to advertisers about how much it knows about its users – and how it can influence their minds","This data life isn’t limited to Facebook. Google, famously, is in the same basic business, although the company is a bit more transparent about it (for a shock, try going to the “My Activity” and “Location History” pages to be vividly reminded that Google is tracking everything). And Amazon is building a modern surveillance panopticon, replete with an always-on microphone for your kitchen and a jaunty camera for your bedroom, purely to sell you more stuff.","Avoiding the big players doesn’t help much. Large data brokers such as Experian and Equifax exist to collate information about everyone, whether or not they’re online. The security services continue to build their own surveillance databases, with powers strengthened in the UK through the recent Investigatory Powers Act. Even going to church now comes with the potential for a dose of surveillance: the Church of England has authorised the roll-out of 14,000 contactless card readers, to let parishioners give without carrying cash. Is it time to say goodbye to the anonymity of the collection plate, and hope you’re one of the more generous donors?","Richard Stallman has been warning of this state of affairs since before Zuckerberg even touched his first computer. The veteran computer scientist, creator of the GNU operating system and leader of the Free Software Movement, warns that “the only database that is not dangerous is the one that is never collected”.","“There is a limit on the level of surveillance that democracy can co-exist with, and we’re far above that,” he tells me on the phone from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “We suffer more surveillance than the inhabitants of the Soviet Union, and we need to push it way down.","“Any database of personal data will be misused, if a misuse can be imagined by humans. It can be misused by the organisation that collects the data. In many cases, the purpose of collecting it is to misuse it, as in the case of Facebook, but also in the case of Amazon, Google to some extent, and thousands of smaller companies as well.","“It can also be misused by rogue employees of the company and it can also be stolen by some third party and misused. There’d be no danger of data breaches if a database doesn’t exist. And, finally, it can be taken by the state and misused.”","Stallman has little sympathy for those who choose to use such services. “They’re foolish,” he says, when I ask him why he thinks data harvesting is tacitly accepted by so many people. “They’re accustomed to a certain kind of convenience ... they choose to ignore that it might be dangerous.”","I’m less certain that there’s a choice being made at all, though. Yes, people may regularly be accepting terms and conditions that require them to give up their data, but that doesn’t mean they read them. I should know: I have. A few years ago, I decided to read, in full, the small print for every single product or service I used. I read almost 150,000 words of legalese – three-quarters of Moby Dick – in less than a week, from the 21,000 words required to turn off the alarm on my iPhone on a Monday morning to the 4,000 words required to browse BuzzFeed in my lunch break.","The experience was gruesome. Legal documents are not written to be read by humans, and certainly not to be read back-to-back in a harrowing marathon of End-User Licence Agreements. But I did learn one thing, which is that the modern notion of consent upon which the entire data edifice is built has the shakiest of foundations.","Lukasz Olejnik, an independent security and privacy researcher, agrees: “Years ago, people and organisations used to shift the blame on the users, even in public. This blaming is unfortunate, because expecting users to be subject-matter experts and versed in the obscure technical aspects is misguided.","“Blaming users is an oversimplification, as most do not understand the true implications when data are shared – they cannot. You can’t expect people to fully appreciate the amount of information extracted from aggregated datasets. That said, you can’t expect users to know what is really happening with their data if it’s not clearly communicated in an informed consent prompt, which should in some cases include also the consequences of hitting ‘I agree’.”","He adds that at many organisations, privacy was not being taken seriously, “except when there was a need to include the phrase ‘We take the privacy of our users very seriously’ following a data breach”.","The modern notion of consent upon which the entire data edifice is built has the shakiest of foundations","It doesn’t have to be like this. Doctors are required to demonstrate not just consent, but informed consent, from patients: the latter have to understand what they are agreeing to, or the agreement is moot. After years of mis-selling scandals, the same principle is slowly making its way to the financial industry. Logging in to check an ISA, you may be confronted with a 12-point questionnaire designed to check you understand the risks and are happy for the investment to continue.","Yet online, the biggest companies in the world base their businesses around users hitting “I agree” on a dialogue box on a website once, a decade ago, and then never being told what their agreement entails, nor being offered any way to retract their consent and take back control of the information they gave up.","Change is coming. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR – overhauls a continent’s worth of rules around a clear principle that the only person who can ever own an individual’s data is that individual.

The reasons fell into three buckets: targeted advertising, security, and evaluation and improvement of services (“business intelligence”).","For a window of 30 days, WhatsApp offered users the option of opting out of data sharing for the purposes of advertising, but no way to entirely opt out of the new data sharing scheme.","The move outraged privacy advocates. After all, at the time of its $19 billion acquisition by Facebook in 2014, WhatsApp had promised never to share data.","That promise goes back further still. In November 2009, WhatsApp founder Jan Koum posted this to the company’s blog:","So first of all, let’s set the record straight. We have not, we do not and we will not ever sell your personal information to anyone. Period. End of story. Hopefully this clears things up.","Clear as mud. In December, France told WhatsApp and Facebook to knock off the data sharing. France’s ultra-vigilant privacy watchdog, the Chair of the National Data Protection Commission (CNIL), gave WhatsApp and Facebook a month to comply with an order to stop sharing data. In its public notice, it said that the messaging app will face sanctions for sharing user phone numbers and usage data for “business intelligence” purposes if it didn’t comply.","WhatsApp swore that it would work to comply with all these data protection authorities, even though they were all barking out differing orders:","We’re committed to resolving the different, and at times conflicting, concerns we’ve heard from European Data Protection Authorities with a common EU approach before the General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in May 2018.","Ahhh, the GDPR: it’s right around the corner, and it features in that public commitment the ICO got WhatsApp to sign.","The document outlines the history of WhatsApp’s privacy policy before and after the Facebook acquisition. The upshot: outside of using UK customers’ data as a “data processor” – data sharing done in order for Facebook to provide support service to WhatsApp, such as to run its messaging service, or perhaps to help out a business that takes out an ad on Facebook to refer people to its WhatsApp account – there’s been no data shared.","My investigation has not been concerned about WhatsApp’s sharing of personal data with Facebook when Facebook are only providing a support service to WhatsApp.","The technical term for such sharing is that WhatsApp can use Facebook as a data processor. This is common practice and if done consistently with the law, under contract, does not generally raise data protection concerns.","In the public commitment, WhatsApp promises to refrain from sharing data with Facebook until the GDPR comes into effect in May, and only if it can do so in accordance with the regulation.","Denham said in her announcement that the investigation had been sparked by outcry from the public and from regulators over WhatsApp and Facebook sharing data.","At the heart of these concerns lies a desire for improved transparency, control, and accountability, at a time when personal data is ever more central to the business models of key players in the digital economy.","One of many examples of that loud outcry: The EU’s influential privacy body, the Article 29 Working Party (WP29), in October 2016 published an unflattering open letter outlining its worries.","Isabelle Falque Pierrotin, who chairs the working party, explained the problem, which was that the new terms had contradicted promises made to users when they signed up for the service:","These changes have been introduced in contradiction with previous public statements of the two companies ensuring that no sharing of data would ever take place.","The companies had also been vague about the precise nature of the sharing, she said:","The Article 29 Working Party has serious concerns regarding the manner in which the information relating to the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy was provided to users and consequently about the validity of the users’ consent."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-16"}

As detailed by the report, Cambridge Analytica — a consulting firm that secured financial backing from prominent Republican donor Robert Mercer — “harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.”","The Times notes that the breach “allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.”","As another New York Times report makes clear, Facebook users were paid a small sum to take a “personality quiz” and download an app. That app “would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time.” Only a “tiny fraction” of the estimated 50 million users involved had actually agreed to release their information to a third party.","As one might expect, the U.K.-based Cambridge Analytica has been suspended from Facebook. The firm is also under scrutiny from lawmakers in both the U.S. and the U.K.","But as Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth tweeted, “This was unequivocally not a data breach.” Bosworth pointed out that there was no hack, and nothing was stolen.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","Technically, he’s correct. But that creates a different sort of criticism toward Facebook: if this can happen — if there are ways for third parties to use your information without you agreeing to it — can you really trust Facebook at all?","Taking Control Of Facebook","So what can you do? Some who were souring on Facebook might be willing to delete the app completely and leave the platform. That’s certainly one option.","If you are going to remain on Facebook, our best tip would be to take a look at everything linked to your account. Go into your Settings, then click Apps. From there, you’ll be able to see every third-party app in which you’ve logged in using Facebook. Feel free to remove any apps from your account that you don’t want having access to your basic profile information. While you’re at it, click Ads to check out or change your ad settings.","We would urge all users to not allow access from unknown developers — do you really need to take a personality quiz? It also wouldn’t hurt to create your own logins for third-party apps, rather than relying on Facebook to provide login information.","Comments","Phil Dzikiy is Editor of Security Baron.

You can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container. Clicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.Which website features will not function?Because you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.","In addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.What does Facebook Container NOT protect against?It is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.","Rather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.What data does Mozilla receive from this extension?Mozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn moreOther ContainersFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site. Known IssuesWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.NOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.What version of Firefox do I need for this?This extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.","If you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)How does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?Facebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.","You can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.","Facebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.Report IssuesIf you come across any issues with this extension, please let us know by filing an issue here.

He sold nearly $500 million worth of Facebook stock in the 28-day month, according to SEC filings.","But investors need not worry.","“Insider selling can often be a warning sign for stocks, but Facebook investors should look at Zuckerberg’s move to sell as a good thing, as it has nothing to do with a lack of faith in the company,” wrote Benjamin Rains, president and senior investment strategist of Zacks Investment Research.","Zuckerberg’s stock exit is part of a plan, which he made public in September 2017, to transfer his Facebook assets to his philanthropic vehicle, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI).","In September, he said he would sell 35 million to 75 million shares of Facebook stock, worth approximately $6 billion to $12.5 billion based on stock prices at the time, in the following 18 months to fund CZI, which ambitiously pledged $3 billion in February 2017 to cure all diseases in one generation.","In the long term, Zuckerberg has pledged to donate 99 precent of his Facebook holdings to CZI, a commitment currently worth about $50 billion. He owns 10 percent of Facebook, including 87 percent of voting shares, according to a company filing in February.","In August 2017, Gates donated 64 million shares of Microsoft stocks worth $4.6 billion.

We did.","What do I mean?","I mean one hard lesson of this age is: social media makes us hackable. You and me. Human beings. Prone to being manipulated, played like violins. Of course, the truth is that we always are vulnerable, fallible things. But social media is like installing a backdoor in your mind, that almost anyone with the requisite purpose and skills can easily exploit.","So massively and easily hackable, in fact, that whole societies are getting manipulated in mere months into believing outlandish things — like electing demagogues President, or leaving their allies behind. What democracy faces now is like propaganda on steroids. Here’s how (and I’ll leave aside the obvious issue of “hypertargeting” people with personal info essentially taken without their consent).","The most powerful trick that hackers from a certain country used to “influence” American voters was social proof. They’d set up several social media accounts. The first would put forth some absurdly radical view — say, “Obama’s a secret Muslim” or “refugees are raping women in your town”. Then another account would pretend to hotly dispute it (“Why I never!!”), to be totally unconvinced. The first account would slowly but surely “persuade” them. Several more would chime in, too, saying they were “persuaded” as well.","Now, this masquerade of persuasion was in public view — by design. A little theatrical show often meant that the original discussion would attract hundreds, maybe thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, over time, of likes, retweets, replies, and so on (or the equivalent on Facebook). And that, my friends, is social proof. You believe a thing because a hundred people, or a thousand people, or a hundred thousand people, appear to validate it — all the objections resolved, the questions answered, tougher minds than you changed. If enough people believe it’s real, hasn’t it been proven? Popularity becomes a litmus test for truth.","(Note the subtlety of the ploy — and my oversimplification. Not just naive popularity is at stake here. You’re watching someone else’s mind being changed. This isn’t persuasive messaging, like advertising — it’s more like meta-messaging. So you’re not being persuaded directly — you’re being shaped, molded, influenced, without even knowing or considering it, by what you think is a genuine, good-faith interaction. That’s clever, isn’t it?)","How easy it is to hack a mind. Using this technique of social proof, hackers were able to manipulate people at mass scale, spending pennies — all they really had was to carefully construct social proof, to design sociality itself to “prove” what they wanted it to.","Now. You probably think: “Pah! Umair! Come on, dude. I’d never fall for such a thing!” Really? Think about it with me — and be honest. Don’t you, every single day, when you check social media, ascertain the veracity of a message by how many people have amplified it? Responded to it? Already verified it? Even just a little bit, don’t you give more credence to popular things than unpopular ones? Hence, you that way rely on other people’s opinions as a kind of cognitive crutch. You can tell me you don’t, but the simple truth is that we all do (including me).","Why is that? Why must we rely on social proof to sort noise from signal on the web? It’s simple — because there is too much info there for anyone to filter through themselves. We must rely on others to achieve what you might call informational economies of scale — discover, verify, validate a wave here and there amidst this endless, roiling sea of information. But information overload in this way makes us susceptible to the misuses of social proof, too.","Now. Social proof is the first leg of why social media makes minds easily hackable. What’s the second?","It’s that social media has been engineered to be massively addictive. How many people liked your latest status update? How many new friends, fans, followers do you have? Ping, buzz, update. In this way, we became compulsive users of social technologies — checking our apps hundreds of times a day. Chasing that next dopamine hit — wow! I gained 100 new fans for that offhand joke!! that perfect selfie!! — we’re glued to social technologies like we’ve never been attached to any technology before, not even TV, because they give us that whoosh, that adrenaline rush of dopamine, of approval and faux intimacy, which, being fragile little humans, we forever crave.","What happens when you combine addictive, dopamine tech with social proof? Kaboom. You have something like history’s perfect recipe to hack minds on a mass scale. To spread disinformation, propaganda, and half-truths unchallenged. To provoke, incite, inflame, and aggrieve. Dopamine tech addicts us to social proof — but social proof makes it easy to manipulate us into believing fantastically absurd things.","Not just a few people — but whole societies of them, easily, almost effortlessly, with a troll farm here or there, in just a matter of years. How else do we explain much of the world turning upside down, going extremist, in just a few years?","Think about it. There you are, checking your social technologies every few minutes, nervously waiting for the next update. What are you doing most of the while? You’re relying on social proof to validate facts, seeing who’s already been persuaded by what and whom else, to ascertain realities, to filter signal from noise — you are using popularity as a litmus test for truth. So because that technology is dopamine driven, you’re addicted to social proof, biting your nails, thinking, “well, a hundred people believe it’s true…it’s got to have some credibility. Let me reply and…” Click. Tap. Whoosh. The rush. You see my point.","But popularity is not a very good test of truth. Social proof is not a very good way to judge veridicality, to establish what’s true and what’s false. In fact, it’s a very poor way. Humans relied on it for millennia — and we called those ages dark ages, didn’t we? Because people became prone to groupthink, to ideology, to superstition — which, repeated endlessly, solidified into belief. It was pretty popular to believe the Sun revolved around the Earth, too. Then, after centuries, along came science, reason, empiricism — Enlightenment from such dark times.","In just the same way, social technologies have taken us epistemologically backwards. We have come to rely on social proof as truth-testing—addictively so, in pursuit of the next dopamine hit. But that leaves us easily mentally hacked. All that a clever hacker has to do is manipulate what can be proven socially — and presto! A new reality is created. Obama really is a Muslim. Those immigrants really are taking your jobs. And so on.","So. Facebook didn’t get hacked. Facebook made it easy to hack us. You and me. Our minds. It tunneled a dopamine backdoor straight into our brains, which anyone with enough cleverness and time could exploit, with social proof. And soon enough, they did. So easily that whole societies were hacked in just a few years.","Hence, today, democracy is falling apart. Not just because we didn’t vote, or we aren’t passionate enough. But we have been manipulated into becoming something like the inhabitants of dark ages. If enough people believe it, enough of us tend to believe it, too. A democracy cannot thrive that way. It is an exercise in self-determination, and it needs people who are self-determined, too — not victims of one another’s folly."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings. Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them.","Wednesday’s announcement follows revelations that a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn’t given explicit consent to sharing. In addition, Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices.","Facebook’s chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for “some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.”","Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details.","The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people. For example, Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page.","Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls. Now, Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place. Facebook says it is also adding “clearer explanations” about how its privacy controls work.","Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer, called the new settings “the first of many steps” the company is taking to address privacy concerns.","Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25. The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data. They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents, no matter where it is based.","To comply with this, Facebook is adding a section called “access your information,” a secure way for users to manage data they’ve shared with the company, including status updates, comments and things they have searched for. That’s where people can go to delete information or download a copy. While this download was already possible, it took some time to figure out how to do it. Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail, without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past.","Cox said that while the changes are “in line with the principle of GDPR,” there’s also a “bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.”","Facebook also said it will propose updates to its terms of service in the coming weeks and update its privacy policy, but gave no further details."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Last month, the NRA made a $3m ad buy in these states that branded Clinton as a “hypocrite” for accepting secret service protection, while calling for more gun control, which the ad charged “would leave you defenseless”. An earlier NRA ad buy attacked Clinton on Benghazi.","In 2012, the NRA spent $15m in the hope of making Barack Obama a one-term president, and this year’s spending to defeat Clinton is expected to surpass that sum, according to the board member and another NRA source.","The five million-member NRA’s embrace of Trump, who once backed more gun control measures, has been spurred in part by its intense fear of a Clinton presidency.","Democrats running for president have traditionally shown “trepidation” about calling for more gun control, notes Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. But this year, Schlapp told the Guardian, “the NRA and gun enthusiasts are faced with the specter of a Democrat running for the White House embracing additional gun control”.","The NRA disdains Clinton’s advocacy of moderate gun control measures –including expanding background checks on gun purchases and reinstating a ban on assault weapons to curb mass shootings – but is fearful that she would nominate supreme court justices who do not concur with the NRA’s staunch opposition to new gun controls.","“This race is probably more about the supreme court than anything else from the NRA’s perspective,” said the NRA board member.","The supreme court stakes are high: the vacancy created by the death of conservative Antonin Scalia is likely to remain open until the next president takes office. And the NRA is especially concerned that a more liberal court might overturn an earlier supreme court decision, known as Heller, which established an individual’s right to keep a handgun in the house for self-defense.","Significantly, the NRA’s endorsement of Trump in May at its annual convention came earlier than usual: Mitt Romney and John McCain had to wait until October in 2012 and 2008 to get the NRA’s blessing.","The NRA’s commitment to Trump was underscored when Chris Cox, the NRA’s top lobbyist gave a primetime speech at the GOP convention this summer, a first for the increasingly GOP-oriented pro-gun lobbying behemoth. A senior GOP operative noted that historically the NRA “tries to stay assiduously non-partisan. The dynamics of speaking at a convention are a little dicey.”","The NRA’s big campaign blitz has been partly fueled by an aggressive fundraising operation which in recent years has targeted mega-donors. In 2014, for instance, the NRA received $4.9m from Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the financial hub of the conservative advocacy network backed by the billionaire Koch brothers. The NRA is hoping to pull in another seven-figure grant this year, say two NRA sources, although nothing has come in yet and the Koch network itself is not focusing on the presidential race and Trump has been sharply criticized by Charles Koch.","The NRA’s entree to the Koch world stems in part from bonds that the gun group’s top officials have forged. One donor who goes to the twice-a-year policy and fundraising retreats hosted by the Koch network, told the Guardian that the NRA’s top executive, Wayne LaPierre, has attended them on a couple of occasions, affording him a chance to pitch and schmooze with big network donors such as investor Foster Friess.","Another key big-money link involves the hedge fund tycoon Robert Mercer, who has given a pro-Trump Super Pac at least $2m, and is also a lifetime NRA member and a Koch network donor. This year Cambridge Analytica, a voter data firm in which Mercer is a key investor, has worked with the Herald Group, a DC-based consulting firm, to implement the NRA’s “Trigger the Vote” drive to register new voters and get them to the polls. i360, a big voter data firm that is closely tied to the Koch donor network, has also been involved in the Trigger the Vote campaign.","The pro-Trump blitz comes despite the real estate mogul’s earlier backing for a ban on assault weapons and longer waiting periods for background checks with gun purchases, ideas that the NRA has rejected. But Trump’s high-decibel anti-gun-control rhetoric this year seems to have ingratiated him with the NRA brass, and coupled with the strong pro-gun records of Trump’s two sons, proved instrumental in winning the NRA’s backing.","Trump and the NRA parted ways briefly earlier this year, when Trump responded to the Orlando massacre by suggesting that if the nightclub where it took place had allowed its guests to bring in arms, then the killings could have been averted. The NRA quickly shot back to distance itself from Trump: speaking to an ABC news show, the group’s top lobbyist, Cox, said that Trump’s calls for arming people in clubs “defies common sense. It also defies the law.”"],"isopubdate":"2016-09-16"}

Nix did not know he was being taped as reporters from NBC News' U.K. partner ITN Channel 4 News pose as potential clients who want to disrupt the Sri Lankan elections.","UPDATE:","According to a report in today's New York Times, a company called Cambridge Analytica illegally grabbed data from 50 million Facebook profiles without the permission of the account owners. This was allegedly done for the 2014 mid-term elections as Cambridge was the recipient of a $15 million investment from loaded Republican donor Robert Mercer. Cambridge also attracted the attention of Mercer's political advisor, Stephen Bannon, by promising to develop a method to identify personality traits of U.S. voters and guide them into voting GOP.","The Times article is based on information it obtained from documents and from former Cambridge employees and associates. The company was able to create one of the largest data leaks in Facebook history. This allowed Cambridge to hone its system in time for Republicans to use the data obtained illegally, to work on President Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.","Cambridge still has control of this data, and Facebook has yet to state that the data was stolen from it. As it turns out, Cambridge says that it paid for the data from a researcher who claimed that he was collecting it for academic reasons. The researcher, a Russian-American by the name of Aleksandr Kogan, has been suspended from using Facebook along with Cambridge Analytica and the latter's co-founder, Christopher Wylie.","Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix denied obtaining and employing Facebook data during previous hearings. However, he changed his tune in a statement to the Times, although he put the blame on the researcher Kogan. He also said that the data was deleted two-years ago, contradicting others familiar with the story.","The data used by Cambridge Analytica came from an app built by the Russian-American Kogan, who was a psychology professor at Cambridge University. The professor was familiar with a similar app built by the University’s Psychometrics Centre, which uses \"Likes\" put up by Facebook users to come up with personality traits of these social media users. The information was used by the Trump campaign to target the placement of things like digital ads and fund-raising requests. The data was also used to figure out where the campaign should spend $5 million in television ads, and where to send Trump for personal appearances.","Is there something shady about Cambridge Analtyical? Consider that CEO Nix was recorded by Channel 4 TV in Britain as saying that he has used front companies and ex-spies on behalf of political clients. But the political clients are getting harder to find. In fact, no American campaigns have appeared to sign up for the company's services for the 2018 mid-term election, and it is unknown whether the Trump 2020 re-election campaign will use them again.","Email from Russian-American professor Aleksandr Kogan to Cambridge Analytica co-founder Christopher Wylie detailing the kinds of traits that can be predicted using data from Facebook and a questionnaire","No one asked for a saint. But it's a Grand Canyon sized stretch to make a career conman and pathological liar, anywhere near trustworthy without having to resort to false equivalencies and other textbook fallacies.","The clowns were Hillary, Obama and all their thief gang who ruled the country for the past 8 years... All these conspiracy theories lead to a hot stinking pile of poop. Nothing more. FaceBook is responsible for their own data and who can say that data was exactly used to manipulate people??

People aren't as stupid as you think. They don't get fooled by all these media stories.

This notion that is saying all those Americans were fooled merely by these fb posts are insane and hilarious. This is just another excuse story Dems want to put out juet because they lost in 2016. Dems also has used these services before and no one complained about that then...","There was nothing on those fb posts about Hillary that were false. Many of those fb posts contained how corrupt Hillary is as a politician all her life and how she and her crony husband earned millions and millions of dollars from Russia an various other countries in return of American wealth such as Uranium. People ought to know those FACTS one way or the other because American main stream media do not like to talk about those things.","Licensed by Hillary Clinton on her own will without properly going to the congress, approved by her friend the puppet president who does not love his country Mr. Barack Obama.

She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa[14] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[15] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[12] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[16] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[17]","In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[15] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[18]","She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[19] During her time at Google, she grew the ad and sales team from four people to 4,000.[20]","In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as \"a perfect fit\" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[21]","After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was \"primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow.\"[9] By late spring,[when?] Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, \"with the ads discreetly presented\"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[22]","In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[23]","In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[24]","In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[27] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[28] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled \"Why we have too few women leaders.\"[29] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[30] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[31] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[32] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[33] In 2016, she delivered the Commencement Address at the University of California Berkeley graduation ceremony. It was the first time she spoke publicly about her husband's death, and stressed the importance of resilience.[34] The following year she delivered the Commencement Address to Virginia Tech's Class of 2017. On June 8, 2018 she gave the Commencement Address for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA.[35]","It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[36][37][38][39][40][41] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[42]","Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[43] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.","A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[44]","Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is \"too elitist\" and another that she is \"tone-deaf\" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[45][46] Sandberg mentions both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is \"acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families\"[47] and that her intention was to \"offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook.\".[48] Furthermore, following the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal, it has been put into question Sandberg's willingness to actually lean in. \" 'She's not leaning in at all,\" McNamee said, in a reference Sandberg's widely read book published five years ago. \"If ever there was a time for her to lean in, this is it.' \" [49]","In her book, she does suggest other women to lean in during challenges.","...we're failing to encourage women to aspire to leadership. It is time to cheer on girls and women who want to sit at the table, seek challenges, and lean in to their careers.[50]","Instead, she has been perceived as a COO who avoids engaging in this crisis.\n\"Sandberg, the architect of the business model that is now the subject of so much scrutiny, has remained silent in public.\" [49]","In her favor, it can be said that in her book she recognizes those who do tackle crises.","I have the deepest respect for people who provide hands-on help to those in crises. It is the most difficult work in the world.[51]","Sandberg released her second book, Option B, in April 2017. Option B is co-authored with Wharton professor, Adam Grant. The book puts emphasis on grief and resilience in challenges within life.[52] It offers practical tips for creating resilience in the family and community. 2.75 million copies have been sold since the release.[53]","In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[54][55][56]","On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly, and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill, while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia, and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]","Sandberg was named one of the \"25 Most Influential People on the Web\" by Business Week in 2009.[79]","She has been listed as one of the world's 100 most powerful women by Forbes.[80] In 2014, Sandberg was listed as ninth, just behind Michelle Obama,[81] and in 2017 Number 4.[82]","In 2012, Newsweek and The Daily Beast released their first \"Digital Power Index\", a list of the 100 most significant people in the digital world that year (plus 10 additional \"Lifetime Achievement\" winners), and she was ranked #3 in the \"Evangelists\" category.[83]","In 2012, she was named in Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world assembled by Time.[6]"],"isopubdate":""}

{"originalurl":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/gop-rigs-elections-gerrymandering-voter-id-laws-dark-money-w515664","title":"GOP Rigs Elections: Gerrymandering, Voter-ID Laws, Dark Money – Rolling Stone","text":["On a quiet, tree-lined street in Racine, Wisconsin, in a neighborhood known as the Danish Village for its Scandinavian ancestry, sits a two-story white house with a large American flag hanging from the porch and a pro-police “We Back the Badge” sign in the yard. It’s the home of Republican state Sen. Van Wanggaard, a 65-year-old former cop whose blond hair resembles that of Dennis the Menace.","Two houses to the south, Wanggaard’s state Senate district – the 21st – abruptly cuts off to exclude the rest of the largely Democratic neighborhood. This used to be one of the state’s most competitive Senate districts, encompassing all of rectangular-shaped Racine County, a 50/50 mix of urban and rural communities in southeast Wisconsin. But since the GOP gained control of the state’s government in 2010, and redrew the legislative maps, the district is now shaped like a horseshoe, pulling in the Republican countryside of Racine and Kenosha counties while excluding heavily Democratic areas – except for the block where Wanggaard lives. “It’s a prime example of how a party in power chose a district for their guy,” says John Lehman, a Democrat who represented the 21st before Wanggaard.","To say that Republicans are facing a toxic political environment heading into the 2018 midterm elections would be a massive understatement. Donald Trump is the most unpopular president at this stage of his term in modern American history. Just three in 10 Americans have a favorable view of the Republican Party, and Democratic voters’ enthusiasm to vote in 2018 tops Republican voters’ by 17 points. But because of sophisticated gerrymandering, Republicans who should be vulnerable, like Wanggaard, have been seen as untouchable. “It’s more challenging than it should be because of the way the districts are drawn,” says Jenni Dye, who works for Democrats in Wisconsin’s state Senate. Wanggaard is among 11 Republican state senators up for re-election in 2018, but no one has stepped forward to challenge him yet.","The gerrymandering in Wisconsin, which experts call among the most extreme in U.S. history, is but one part of Republicans’ stealth plan to stay in office. Since Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican Legislature took power, they’ve also introduced some of the country’s harshest voting restrictions, passing laws that make it harder for Democratic-leaning constituencies to register to vote and cast ballots. At the same time, the state has become the “Wild West of dark money,” according to Lisa Graves, a senior fellow at the Madison-based Center for Media and Democracy, with Republican politicians like Walker raising unprecedented sums from billionaire donors to finance their campaigns.","Related","“All three of these things have to be seen as part of a whole,” says Eric Holder, Barack Obama’s attorney general, who founded the National Democratic Redistricting Committee in 2016 to challenge Republican gerrymandering efforts. “Unregulated dark money combined with these voter-ID laws combined with gerrymandering is inconsistent with how our nation’s system is supposed to be set up. American citizens ought to be concerned about the state of our democracy. We could end up with a system where a well-financed minority that has views inconsistent with the vast majority of the American people runs this country.”","More immediately, a beleaguered Republican Party tainted by Trump could still retain majorities in 2018 and 2020. “It’s not a level playing field,” says Tom Perez, head of the Democratic National Committee. “There are millions of people whose votes effectively don’t count.” And as a measure of the GOP’s ability to maintain a political advantage, despite widespread public opposition to its policies, look no further than Wisconsin. “We’ve been under a counterrevolution here for the past six years,” says Matt Rothschild, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks the influence of money in politics. “Walker has urged other states to follow his model. Reactionary politics is a big Wisconsin export now.”","In the summer of 2011, soon after activists occupied the rotunda of the Wisconsin state capitol to protest Walker’s bill stripping public-employee unions of collective-bargaining rights, Republican members of the legislature visited the offices of Michael Best & Friedrich, the party’s go-to law firm. The GOP was in control of the state’s redistricting process for the first time since the 1950s, and Republicans were shown to the “map room,” where their aides were drawing new political districts in secret following the 2010 census. The legislators signed confidentiality agreements, pledging not to discuss the work with anyone, even though the redistricting was financed with taxpayer funds. “Public comments on this map may be different than what you hear in this room,” read the talking points distributed to GOP legislators. “Ignore the public comments.”","The new maps had titles like “Aggressive,” to describe how they favored Republicans. “The maps we pass will determine who’s here 10 years from now,” a legislative aide told the Republican caucus. “We have an opportunity . . . to draw these maps that Republicans haven’t had in decades.”","On July 11th, 2011, the maps were introduced in the Legislature; no Democrat had seen them before they were released. There was one public hearing, two days later, and the reshaped districts were approved the next week on a party-line vote. “This looks fair to me,” said Wanggaard to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “I don’t have anything jumping out at me.” (Wanggaard declined to comment for this article.)","Yet his district had been radically transformed, from a 50/50 swing district to one that favored a Republican by 16 points. Racine and Kenosha counties, which border each other, had been separate state Senate districts, which made sense: The counties have their own newspapers, school districts and boards of supervisors. Both districts were politically competitive. “For the citizens, their vote really mattered,” says Lehman, the former state senator. “That’s the way it ought to be in every single district in America.”","Republicans took the districts and flipped them vertically, combining Racine and Kenosha counties for the first time in a hundred years. As a result, Republicans gained at least two seats in the state Legislature. Wanggaard’s new red district encompassed the sprawling GOP exurbs and farmland, with Democratic voters concentrated in the urban centers of the two counties.","Lehman, a retired public-school teacher in Racine, represented the 21st District from 1996 to 2010. He lived a few blocks from Wanggaard and used to teach at the same high school where Wanggaard was sometimes stationed as an off-duty cop. Wanggaard defeated him in 2010 by 3,000 votes. But after Wanggaard voted for Walker’s anti-union legislation, Lehman beat him in a recall election in 2012. By then the new district lines had been drawn by Republicans, but they didn’t take effect until after the recall, which put Lehman in the awkward position of winning an election in his competitive old district but serving a new, deeply Republican one. “I tried to serve the district, but it was like a foreign land,” he says.","On a brisk afternoon in late November, Lehman took me on a tour of the 21st. We departed from the Racine neighborhood where he and Wanggaard live and drove down narrow country roads to the far southwest corner of the district, passing old farms, new McMansions and small towns with yard signs that read “Keeping Christ in Christmas.” After an hour, we reached the resort town of Twin Lakes, population 6,000, near the Illinois border.","Unlike Racine, which has a large black population and votes Democratic, Twin Lakes is overwhelmingly white and Republican; Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff to Donald Trump, used to be its village attorney. When Lehman spoke at a Memorial Day parade in Twin Lakes, throwing candy to kids, “few people knew who I was,” he says. When he had listening sessions in the district’s rural areas, nobody showed up. “If you lived out here, would you pay any attention to anything that happened in Racine?” Lehman asks.","In 2014, Lehman decided to run for lieutenant governor instead of trying to win re-election in his new district. “It was unwinnable for a Democrat,” he says. Wanggaard ran again and won by 23 points.","Most of the state Legislature’s Republican majority has been just as secure. In 2012, Obama carried Wisconsin by seven points, and Democratic legislative candidates received 51.4 percent of the statewide vote, but Republican candidates won 60 of 99 seats in the Statehouse. Under the Republican map, the number of safe GOP seats in the 132-member legislature increased from 55 to 69, and the number of swing districts decreased from 24 to 13. It’s a practically foolproof system: No matter what happened nationally, Republicans would maintain control of state politics.","This isn’t just a problem in Wisconsin. Following the 2010 elections, Republicans had full control of the redistricting process for state legislative and U.S. House seats in 21 states, compared with eight states for Democrats. Republicans now hold as many as 22 additional House seats because of gerrymandering, according to an analysis by the Associated Press – nearly the same margin as the 24 seats Democrats need in order to take back the House. During the 2012 elections, Democratic House candidates won 1.4 million more votes nationally than Republicans, but the GOP won 33 more seats. Of course, Democrats have also employed gerrymandering to gain partisan advantage, including in blue states like Illinois and Maryland. But in the past decade Republicans have turned the manipulation of political lines into an art form.","Democrats in Wisconsin went to court to contest these efforts. In November 2016, a federal court panel surprisingly struck down Wisconsin’s state legislative maps as “an unconstitutional political gerrymander” that was “intended to burden the representational rights of Democratic voters . . . by impeding their ability to translate their votes into legislative seats.” Republicans appealed to the Supreme Court, which will rule on the landmark case, Gill v. Whitford, this year. The justices have the chance to outlaw partisan gerrymandering not just in Wisconsin but nationwide, for the first time in American history. “It would be a really big deal for the court to say there’s limits on how far you can go when it comes to partisan gerrymandering,” Holder says.","Gerrymandering the state’s political boundaries isn’t the only method Republicans in Wisconsin use to prevent Democrats from winning elections. On Election Day 2016, Charisma Townsend, a 24-year-old massage therapist, went to cast her ballot at a library in Milwaukee’s Washington Park, a working-class, predominantly African-American neighborhood northwest of downtown. Voting was important to Townsend. “I try my hardest to make change where I can, and I feel like voting is one of those things that helps you make a change,” she says. And she was eager to vote against Trump, whom she calls “a waste of space for our country.”","But this was Wisconsin’s first major election that required people to show government-issued photo ID to vote. Townsend, who was registered in Wisconsin, had misplaced her driver’s license before the election; she brought her student ID from Milwaukee Area Technical College, a copy of her energy bill and a picture of her driver’s license on her phone. None were accepted as a valid voting ID under the law.","Instead, poll workers gave her a provisional ballot. It would only count if she went to the DMV to get a new license and then to the board of elections to confirm her vote within 72 hours of Election Day. But Townsend worked full-time and couldn’t get away. Having voted for Obama in 2012, she found herself unable to cast a ballot in 2016. “I showed them so many different versions of me,” she says. “I felt like they were trying their hardest for me to not vote.”","Townsend was not alone. After the Legislature passed the law in May 2011, a federal court found that nine percent of registered voters in the state did not have the required forms of ID. Black voters, who overwhelmingly supported Democrats in Wisconsin, were 50 percent more likely than whites to lack such IDs. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, up to 11 percent of Americans do not possess government-issued photo IDs, including 25 percent of African-American voters. “We see these restrictions sprouting up like mushrooms in battleground states with large minority populations,” says Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the ACLU, which challenged Wisconsin’s law in court. “Laws that require you to have a particular ID to cast a ballot disproportionately impact certain groups of voters, particularly poorer voters who don’t have the same access to documentation and IDs as the rest of us.”","Republicans claimed the voter-ID law was needed to stop widespread voter fraud. After Wanggaard lost the recall by 819 votes, his lawyer said election officials in Racine had “used procedures that would make Fidel Castro blush.” Republicans claimed that voter registrations were found in a dumpster, poll books were unsigned and union members were bused from Michigan to vote illegally. “Anyone who argues . . . that we do not need voter ID either wants to conceal these potential fraudulent activities or hasn’t been paying attention,” Wanggaard, who co-sponsored the law, told Vice News. Yet no evidence of fraud turned up when the county sheriff and district attorney, both Republicans, launched a monthlong investigation, nor did Republicans present any cases of voter impersonation when the law was challenged in court. (The law, initially blocked for violating the Voting Rights Act, was reinstated in 2014 by a panel of conservative judges.)","Voter fraud is a very small problem in Wisconsin, and nationally. According to one major study, from 2000 to 2014, there were only 31 cases of voter impersonation out of more than 1 billion votes cast. “Studies show that the kind of fraud that these laws are supposedly enacted to prevent happens less frequently than Americans being struck by lightning,” says Ho.","Even some Republicans have admitted that ID laws help prevent Democrats from voting. On the night of Wisconsin’s 2016 primary, Rep. Glenn Grothman predicted a Republican would carry the state in November, saying, “I think Hillary Clinton is about the weakest candidate the Democrats have ever put up, and now we have photo ID, and I think photo ID is going to make a little bit of a difference.”","The Republican strategy worked as intended. Wisconsin ranked second in the nation in voter participation in 2008 and 2012, but in 2016 saw a 3.3 percent drop in turnout, the largest decrease in voting of any state other than Mississippi. Roughly half of it occurred in Milwaukee. In black neighborhoods, which heavily favored Clinton, turnout decreased by 23 percent. Overall, black turnout dropped by 19 percent in Wisconsin in 2016 compared with 2012, more than four times the national decline among black voters, according to a report by the Center for American Progress.","After the election, registered voters who didn’t cast a ballot in Milwaukee and Madison, the state’s two most Democratic areas, were asked why. One in 10 nonvoters said they were blocked or deterred by the state’s ID law, according to a University of Wisconsin study. That meant up to 23,000 people in two counties alone didn’t show up at least in part because of the ID requirement – almost the exact same number of voters by which Trump won the state. Up to 45,000 people were prevented from voting statewide. African-Americans, who voted for Clinton over Trump by an 88-to-8 margin, were three times more likely than whites to be kept from the polls. “Thousands, and perhaps tens of thousands, of otherwise eligible people were deterred from voting by the ID law,” said University of Wisconsin political scientist Kenneth Mayer.","That’s why Republicans passed the law in the first place. In a closed-door meeting of the Senate Republican Caucus in 2011, state Sen. Mary Lazich argued in favor of the bill, saying, “We’ve got to think about what this could mean for the neighborhoods around Milwaukee and the college campuses.” According to a Republican aide who attended the meeting, two other state senators were “giddy” and “politically frothing at the mouth” over the bill.","Wisconsin made it particularly difficult for certain Democratic-leaning constituencies to comply with the law. Because of how it was written, only three of 13 four-year schools in the University of Wisconsin system had compliant student IDs, and just seven of 23 private colleges. Nor did the state adequately reach out to the groups most at risk of being disenfranchised: Wisconsin ran ads about the law in 52 movie theaters across the state, but not a single ad in Milwaukee, where 70 percent of the state’s African-Americans live.","Since the 2010 elections, 23 states have adopted new voting restrictions, such as ID laws, cutting early voting, adding new barriers to voter registration, purging the voting rolls and disenfranchising ex-felons – all of which hurt Democrats more than Republicans. It’s no accident that these laws were passed after the election of the first black president in 2008, who was ushered in by the record turnout of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and young voters. “If you look at the timing of these laws in relation to the changing demographics of the electorate, it can’t just be a coincidence,” says the ACLU’s Ho.","In 2013, the Supreme Court compounded the problem by ruling that states with long histories of voting discrimination no longer had to clear new election rules with the federal government. That made the 2016 election the first presidential contest in more than 50 years without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act, the crown jewel of the civil-rights movement. “It tarnishes the promise that we made to Americans that when they step into the ballot box they are going to be free of racial discrimination,” says Myrna Perez, director of the Voting Rights and Elections project at the Brennan Center for Justice.","Across the country, from Arizona to Ohio to North Carolina, people had trouble voting as a result. According to a study by MIT, an estimated 16 million people – 12 percent of all voters – experienced at least one problem voting in 2016. There were more than 1 million lost votes because eligible voters didn’t have the right ID or they encountered long lines at the polls or couldn’t register. Trump won the election by a combined total of 78,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","Since Trump’s election, Republicans have accelerated their efforts to make it harder to vote. The president’s whopping lie that “millions voted illegally” in 2016 led to the creation of a Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which was run by figures like Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who have repeatedly spread false claims about voter fraud in order to pass policies that restrict access to the ballot. The commission was abruptly disbanded by Trump in early January after facing 15 federal and state lawsuits for violating a wide range of privacy and transparency laws, stemming from the commission’s unprecedented request for sensitive voter data from all 50 states.","Despite the setback, Trump’s Justice Department has reversed the Obama administration’s opposition to voter-ID laws and voter purging. And Republican-controlled statehouses have passed more new voting restrictions in 2017 than in 2016 and 2015 combined. “It’s not a coincidence that states that were badly gerrymandered during the last round of redistricting, like Texas, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, also passed some of the most oppressive voter-ID laws,” says Holder. “They are two parts of the same attack by the Republicans: They have systematically attacked Americans’ right to vote.”","In January 2010, a conservative majority on the Supreme Court radically rewrote America’s campaign-finance laws to allow mega-donors and corporations to contribute unlimited sums, often in secret, to political action committees. The Citizens United v. FEC decision gave wealthy donors unprecedented influence to buy elections, which Republicans quickly used to their political advantage.","During the recall election between Wanggaard and Lehman in the summer of 2012, voters in Racine received a chilling mailer featuring a man grabbing a woman with his hand over her mouth. you’re not safe. thanks to john lehman, said the front of the mailer. The back illustration showed a man in a black hoodie, with the line home invasions. theft. homicide. do the crime. don’t serve the time. The mailer, delivered to 10,000 homes in Racine, was authored by the Republican State Leadership Committee, which raised $30 million ahead of the 2010 elections and spent $1.1 million of it in Wisconsin. Thanks to the Citizens United decision, the RSLC could accept unlimited donations from corporate interests like Koch Industries and tobacco companies to attack Lehman for voting for a state budget that allowed felons to be released early for good behavior or health issues. With clear racial overtones, the mailer was sent just months after Trayvon Martin’s murder in Florida. “It’s the meanest mailer I’ve ever seen,” Lehman told HuffPost.","Scott Walker took this fundraising strategy to new heights when he faced his own recall election in 2012. Walker had long been close to GOP billionaires like Charles and David Koch, who gave $9 million to Walker and his allies between 2010 and 2014. “We’ve spent a lot of money in Wisconsin,” David Koch said in February 2012. “We are going to spend a lot more.” The Kochs and other like-minded conservative donors made Wisconsin their guinea pig for destroying the progressive movement, funding a sprawling network of foundations, think tanks, media organizations and political groups that propped up Walker and the state’s Republican majority.","Walker asked a major fundraiser in September 2011 how he could raise enough money to survive the recall, despite intense public opposition to his full-scale attack on unions, the number-one funder and organizing ally of Democrats. “Corporations. Go heavy after them to give,” wrote his fundraiser Kate Doner. “Take Koch’s money. Get on a plane to Vegas and sit down with Sheldon Adelson. Ask for $1m now.”","Walker did just that, but instead of raising money for his campaign, he steered wealthy donors, including Trump, to the pro-business Wisconsin Club for Growth, which was run by Republican operative Eric O’Keefe. Sometimes called the “third Koch brother,” O’Keefe was national field coordinator for the Libertarian Party in 1980 when David Koch was the party’s vice presidential candidate. Unlike Walker’s campaign, Wisconsin Club for Growth could accept unlimited donations and didn’t have to disclose its donors. “The Governor is encouraging all to invest in the Wisconsin Club for Growth [which] can accept Corporate and Personal donations without limitations and no donors disclosure,” wrote Doner. (The e-mails were released by The Guardian.) Walker’s fundraising spree gave the governor and his allies a huge advantage over his Democratic opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett – $58.7 million to $21.9 million – and he easily won the recall by seven points.","His donors received a generous return on their investment. Between April 2011 and January 2012, Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons, whose company manufactured lead paint, a known danger for developing children, gave three checks totaling $750,000 to Wisconsin Club for Growth. Walker’s adviser warned him about Simmons’ background in a “red flag” e-mail. “We should discuss this so you are aware of what you might need to defend in terms of contributions from donors when these are disclosed,” wrote Walker’s aide Keith Gilkes. “Harold Simmons has consistently been a target of environmentalists. One of the most immediate issues was that NL Industries (purchased by Simmons in 1986) was the leading maker of lead pigment paint.”","After Walker’s recall election, in June 2013, Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature inserted a late-night provision into a budget bill that blocked Wisconsin residents from suing manufacturers like Simmons for lead poisoning. It was among the 100 “worst” pieces of legislation passed during Walker’s tenure, according to a 2016 Wisconsin Democracy Campaign report. The Legislature also changed the definition of “lead-bearing paint” to allow greater amounts of lead, and reduced state lead-paint inspections.","But Walker had a big problem: It was illegal for his campaign to directly coordinate with outside groups like Wisconsin Club for Growth. A special prosecutor opened an investigation alleging a “criminal scheme” between Walker and his outside allies. Conducted in secret, it was known as a “John Doe” investigation. The probe implicated the highest echelons of Walker’s inner circle, until the investigation was abruptly shut down by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in July 2015. Justices are elected in Wisconsin, and the court’s four conservative judges, who had a majority, had received $8 million in outside support from the very groups under investigation, like Wisconsin Club for Growth.","Following the decision, the Republican Legislature launched an unprecedented attack on the state’s campaign-finance system. It doubled the amount donors could give to candidates; allowed corporations to give directly to political parties; authorized outside groups to coordinate with political candidates on “issue advocacy” (the very thing Walker was under investigation for); exempted donors from disclosing where they worked; prevented future John Doe investigations from focusing on political crimes like bribery and misconduct in office; and dismantled the state’s watchdog agency. Wanggaard co-sponsored the bill curtailing John Doe investigations, which he said were “like 1939 Germany.” The bills passed in the middle of the night on November 7th, 2015. “It was just a systematic destruction of the good-government democracy that Wisconsin had enjoyed up to the election of Scott Walker and the Republicans,” says Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin.","Nationally, $3 billion in outside money has been spent since the Citizens United decision, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with at least $800 million of it from entities that don’t have to disclose their donors (hence the term “dark money”). In 2017, Walker was head of the Republican Governors Association, which can accept unlimited contributions. In the first half of that year, the organization brought in a record haul of $36 million, $15 million more than Democrats. The Koch brothers have already pledged to spend $400 million on 2018 races.","Of course, this money doesn’t just help elect Republicans, it dictates their legislative priorities. Before the release of the tax bill, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan invited Corry Bliss, head of the American Action Network Super PAC, to address a closed-door meeting of the House GOP caucus. Bliss previewed an ad campaign in support of the tax overhaul (the group plans to spend $100 million backing the Republican agenda). The message was clear: Support the bill and you’ll be rewarded. Don’t and you’ll be targeted. “Like a teacher showing the kids a paddle on the first day of class, the blatant implication was that those who misbehaved would be spanked,” one member of Congress told HuffPost. (The Koch brothers’ political network chipped in another $20 million for tax reform.)","The tax bill was a shameless giveaway to the wealthiest Americans. Eighty-three percent of the benefits will go to the top one percent by 2027, according to the Tax Policy Center. The bill is deeply unpopular, with only a third of the public approving of it. But Republicans admitted they passed it because their donors told them to. “My donors are basically saying, ‘Get it done or don’t ever call me again,’ ” said Rep. Chris Collins of New York.","I visited Wisconsin a few days after the Senate passed its version of the tax bill. A dozen of Paul Ryan’s constituents were holding a protest in downtown Racine. “Help! Need Cash to Buy Paul Ryan,” one sign said. Cars drove by honking their horns in support. The window of Ryan’s district office was covered with signs and colorful Post-it notes protesting the tax bill: “Paul Ryan steals from the poor, disabled and our vets to give to the ultrarich,” read one. “You care only about donors, not voter[s]!” said another.","Despite these Republican advantages, the end of 2017 brought good news for Democrats. In November, the party won the Virginia governor’s race and picked up a surprising 15 seats in the state’s House of Delegates. A month later, Democrat Doug Jones won a shocking upset over Roy Moore in a special election for the U.S. Senate in Alabama. Democrats are now favored to win control of the House in 2018 and have a shot at taking back the Senate. The tide is even turning in Wisconsin, where in early January 2018 Democrats won a special election by 10 points for a state Senate district that Trump won by 17 points and Republicans had held since 2000. It was the Democrats’ 34th pickup of the 2018 cycle.","The lower courts have already signaled a willingness to push back on unfair redistricting. On January 9th, a federal court struck down North Carolina’s U.S. House map, which gives Republicans a 10-to-three advantage over Democrats, the first time a federal court has invalidated congressional lines for partisan gerrymandering. But on January 18th, the Supreme Court blocked the redrawing of North Carolina’s maps, pending appeal. GOP-drawn districts have also been struck down in Alabama, Florida, Virginia and Texas. Many of these rulings are similarly being appealed by Republicans, making it unlikely such districts will be redrawn before the 2018 elections. After this story went to press, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state’s Congressional maps – which give Republicans a 13 to 5 advantage – and ordered they be redrawn in 2018, boosting Democratic prospects in the state.","Even the recent Democratic victories foreshadow some of the problems the party may face in 2018. In Alabama, Jones defeated Moore by 1.5 percentage points but carried only one of seven congressional districts. In Virginia, Democratic candidates for the House of Delegates won 224,000 more votes than Republicans but were still denied a majority. A Virginia-like result would produce few gains for Democrats in more heavily gerrymandered states like Wisconsin. Democrats need to win 57 percent of the statewide vote there, an almost impossible number, to take back the state Legislature in 2018, says Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor at the University of Chicago.","Nationally, Democrats must win the popular vote for the House of Representatives by eight points to get a bare majority of seats. That might be doable given the unpopularity of Trump, but Democrats still worry about facing a rigged system. “If you have a wave election in 2018, it’s entirely possible Democrats could win a significantly greater number of votes and not have the Congress that reflects that wave,” says Holder. And that’s not how democracy is supposed to work. Hanging in the balance are basic rights for millions of Americans – the right to vote, the right to fair representation, the right to not have elections auctioned to the highest bidder. Welcome to the 2018 election season."],"isopubdate":"2018-06-25"}

Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds","Read more","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.","Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn’t authorized to have that information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded the app and shared their personal details with it, Facebook said. The New York Timesreports that the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information that it received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports “several days ago” that not all the data was deleted.","While it investigates the matter, Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; the academic who created the app in question, a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received the user data from the app.","Exactly why the handling of this data warranted both suspension and Facebook’s unusual public explanation of the move wasn’t clear. The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the “public prominence” of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an “unacceptable violation of trust” and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties “responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.”","In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied any wrongdoing. He said the parent company’s SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake “a large scale research project in the U.S.,” but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan’s company. For the “avoidance of doubt,” the spokesman said, none of Kogan’s data was used in Cambridge Analytica’s 2016 election work.","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica’s role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","But the company has also surfaced a few times during the probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. For instance, Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation after pleading guilty to a felony charge , disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the Hillary Clinton campaign.

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen.

Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

In what legal experts say may be a “watershed” case, a US citizen is using British laws to try to discover how he was profiled and potentially targeted by the Trump campaign.","David Carroll, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design in New York, has discovered a transatlantic legal mechanism that he hopes will give him access to information being sought by both the FBI and the Senate intelligence committee. In recent weeks, investigators looking at how people acting on behalf of Russia targeted American voters have focused on Trump’s data operation. But although the FBI obtained a court order against Facebook to make it disclose evidence, the exact way in which US citizens were profiled and targeted remains largely unknown.","But British data protection laws may provide some transparency on the company at the heart of Trump’s data operation – Cambridge Analytica – and how it created profiles of 240 million Americans. In January, Carroll discovered he – and a group of other citizens – had the right under UK law to ask for his personal data back from the company, and when it failed to supply it, he started filing pre-trial actions to sue the company under British law. The lawsuit is the result of a unique situation, according to Ravi Naik of Irvine Thanvi Natas, the British solicitor who is leading the case. It arose because although Cambridge Analytica is largely owned by Trump’s biggest donor, hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and though its vice-president at the time of the US election was Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the company was spun out of an older British military and elections contractor, SCL, with which it still shares staff, directors and a London office.","In the US, Americans have almost no rights over their data whatsoever","Ravi Naik","Naik says: “It’s this fascinating situation because when it became apparent that Cambridge Analytica had processed Americans’ data in Britain, it suddenly opened up this window of opportunity. In the US, Americans have almost no rights over their data whatsoever, but the data protection framework is set up in such a way that it doesn’t matter where people are: it matters where the data is processed.","“I’m a human rights practitioner and in the past most of my cases were national security issues, but increasingly it’s about data protection and the way people are affected by the misuse of their data. I see this as an issue affecting fundamental rights and it’s taking citizen activism to uncover what’s going on, to request data. I really hear echoes of the civil rights movement in people becoming more aware, more resistant and willing to fight.”","As an academic, Carroll had studied advertising, data and design, but he was still shocked when Cambridge Analytica eventually sent him a “profile” that it had created about him though not the data it was created from. “It was very strange and unsettling because they had given me ‘scores’ for different issues but I had no idea what they’d based this on.” The company scored him 3/10 on “Gun Rights Importance”, 7/10 on “National Security Importance” and “unlikely” to vote Republican.","“I was perplexed by it. I started thinking, ‘Have I had conversations about gun rights on Facebook? Where are they getting this from? And what are they doing with it?’” He reported the firm to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, which is investigating the use of data in political campaigning; he has also launched a CrowdJustice campaign and is appealing to the public to help him take the case as far as he can through the British courts.","It really is a David and Goliath fight and I think it will be the model for other citizens’ actions against other big corporations","Frank Pasquale, University of Maryland","“There are so many disturbing aspects to this. One of the things that really troubles me is how the company can buy anonymous data completely legally from all these different sources, but as soon as it attaches it to voter files, you are re-identified. It means that every privacy policy we have ignored in our use of technology is a broken promise. It would be one thing if this information stayed in the US, if it was an American company and it only did voter data stuff.”","But, he argues, “it’s not just a US company and it’s not just a civilian company”. Instead, he says, it has ties with the military through SCL – “and it doesn’t just do voter targeting”. Carroll has provided information to the Senate intelligence committee and believes that the disclosures mandated by a British court could provide evidence helpful to investigators.","Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland, author of The Black Box Society and a leading expert on big data and the law, called the case a “watershed moment”.","“It really is a David and Goliath fight and I think it will be the model for other citizens’ actions against other big corporations. I think we will look back and see it as a really significant case in terms of the future of algorithmic accountability and data protection. These issues are so critical and in the US there are only these incredible, lethargic data laws largely because of the incredible power of the lobbying industry.”","Big data’s power is terrifying. That could be good news for democracy | George Monbiot","Read more","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician who has created the firm PersonalData.IO to help people reclaim their data, and who helped Carroll with his quest, said it was important that people realised that there are tools they can use against big corporations.","“In the US election, the FBI has been trying to get information from the top down but this doesn’t help with regard to the French election or Brexit,” Dehaye said. “And we know we just cannot trust Facebook, even with good intent, to run our elections fairly. There are a few huge companies amassing vast amounts of data on vast amounts of people and there’s no democratic oversight.”","Pasquale said news that Facebook information had been used by Russian agents to target US citizens may prove to be a tipping point. “It shows this information has now been weaponised by a state actor. What we’re seeing is really a failure of the first order. Mark Zuckerberg wrote this 6,000-word letter about creating a global political community and yet we now know that Facebook was a platform for a devastating attack on the most robust democracy in the world.”"],"isopubdate":"2017-09-30"}

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

This was allegedly done for the 2014 mid-term elections as Cambridge was the recipient of a $15 million investment from loaded Republican donor Robert Mercer.

This allowed Cambridge to hone its system in time for Republicans to use the data obtained illegally, to work on President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016.","Cambridge still has control of this data, and Facebook has yet to state that the data was stolen from it.

You'll get a file with every photo and comment you've posted, all the ads you've clicked on, stuff you've liked and searched for and everyone you've friended — and unfriended — over the years.","Now, the company is under fire for collecting data on people's phone calls and text messages if they used Android devices. While Facebook insists users had to specifically agree, or opt in, to have such data collected, at least some users appeared surprised.","Facebook's trove of data is used to decide which ads to show you. It also makes using Facebook more seamless and enjoyable — say, by determining which posts to emphasize in your feed, or reminding you of friends' birthdays.","Facebook claims to protect all this information, and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that's relatively clear and concise. But few users bother to read it. You might be surprised at what Facebook's privacy policy allows — and what's left unsaid.","Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users. While past privacy debacles have centered on what marketers gather on users, the stakes are higher this time because the firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society.","Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it's adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users. Thanks largely to years of privacy scandals and pressure from users and regulators, Facebook also offers a complex set of controls that let users limit how their information is used — to a point.","You can turn off ad targeting and see generic ads instead, the way you would on television or in a newspaper. In the ad settings, you'd need to uncheck all your interests, interactions with companies and websites and other personal information you don't want to use in targeting. Of course, if you click on a new interest after this, you'll have to go back and uncheck it in your ad preferences to prevent targeting. It's a tedious task.","As Facebook explains, it puts you in target categories based on your activity. So, if you are 35, live in Seattle and have liked an outdoor adventure page, Facebook may show you an ad for a mountain bike shop in your area.","But activity isn't limited to pages or posts you like, comments you make and your use of outside apps and websites.","\"If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those and analyzes them too,\" Zeynep Tufekci, a prominent techno-sociologist, said in a 2017 TED talk.","And, increasingly, Facebook tries to match what it knows about you with your offline data, purchased from data brokers or gathered in other ways. The more information it has, the fuller the picture of you it can offer to advertisers. It can infer things about you that you had no intention of sharing — anything from your ethnicity to personality traits, happiness and use of addictive substances, Tufekci said.","These types of data collection aren't necessarily explicit in privacy policies or settings.","What Facebook does say is that advertisers don't get the raw data. They just tell Facebook what kind of people they want their ads to reach, then Facebook makes the matches and shows the ads.","Apps can also collect a lot of data about you, as revealed in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The firm got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million.","Facebook says Cambridge Analytica got the data inappropriately — but only because the app said it collected data for research rather than political profiling. Gathering data on friends was permitted at the time, even if they had never installed the app or given explicit consent.","Ian Bogost, a Georgia Tech communications professor who built a tongue-in-cheek game called \"Cow Clicker\" in 2010, wrote in The Atlantic recently that abusing the Facebook platform for \"deliberately nefarious ends\" was easy to do then. What's worse, he said, it was hard to avoid extracting private data.","If \"you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior,\" he wrote. \"I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood.\"","Facebook has since restricted the amount of types of data apps can access. But other types of data collection are still permitted. For this reason, it's a good idea to check all the apps you've given permissions to over the years. You can also do this in your settings."],"isopubdate":""}

The social network maintains that Cambridge Analytica violated Facebook’s rules, but all of that collected personal data did not come from a hack.","How Cambridge Analytica got the Facebook data","Until the middle of 2014, Facebook allowed apps to abuse a loophole to collect personal data on a user’s entire friend network. In this case, an app not only harvested data from the person using the personality quiz app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" created by U.K. academic Aleksandr Kogan, but also delved into that person’s friends network and harvested all of their Facebook profile data, as well. Facebook claimed only 270,000 people downloaded that app, but Kogan managed to obtain data from 50 million accounts without their consent. Of those, enough data had been harvested from 30 million for Cambridge Analytica to create psychographic profiles on them.","Facebook removed Kogan’s “research” app in 2015 and demanded users’ collected data to be destroyed.

They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","In a series of rapid-fire and later-deleted tweets made on Saturday, Facebook CSO Alex Stamos took exception to the “breach” terminology.

The firm added, “No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Whistleblower Chritopher Wylie tells his story","Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica, can help you fully understand the scope of what happened and how it “exploited” Facebook.","Wylie is sorry for the role he played in the “full service propaganda machine.” He added that “it was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country. The psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.”","How many times will people accept Facebook’s version of truth — that “protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook”? Over and over throughout the years, despite carefully worded statements after some privacy fiasco, Facebook has proven that users’ privacy is not at the heart of the company. Making money via collecting data about users to sell ads is.","Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.) added, “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

You!","text":["Unfortunately, there is yet another Facebook outrage happening at the same time -- it has been discovered that the company has been logging phone call and SMS information from Android users. Today, Facebook admits to the behavior, but it claims the blame is with users. In other words, Facebook is taking no responsibility.","You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission.","This is not the case.","Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provide you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.","We introduced this feature for Android users a couple of years ago. Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and services as a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with. This was first introduced in Messenger in 2015, and later offered as an option in Facebook Lite, a lightweight version of Facebook for Android.","When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history. For Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose ‘learn more’ or ‘not now’. On Facebook Lite, the options are to turn it on or ‘skip’. If you chose to turn this feature on, we will begin to continuously log this information, which can be downloaded at any time using the Download Your Information tool.","If, at any point, you no longer wish to continuously upload this information, you can easily turn this feature off in your settings. You can also to turn off continuous call and text history logging while keeping contact uploading enabled. You can also go to this page to see which contacts you have uploaded from Messenger, and you can delete all contact information you’ve uploaded from that app should you choose.","When this feature is enabled, uploading your contacts also allows us to use information like when a call or text was made or received.

{"originalurl":"https://www.mcgarrsolicitors.ie/2008/01/20/facebooks-european-privacy-problem/","title":"Facebook's European Privacy Problem - McGarr Solicitors - Dublin Solicitors Ireland","text":["There is a suggestion in the Irish Times that Facebook Inc may be considering locating a European base of operations in Ireland. In that context it may be useful to consider the current situation regarding Facebook, its attendant applications and their use of Irish and","European users’ Personal Data. The main question is whether all of Facebook’s behaviour is in compliance with Europe’s Data Protection Law, and the extent to which that law may apply to either Facebook Inc or any of the controllers of the Applications which rely on its systems.","This discussion is intended to be readable by a non-lawyer but it is inescapable that some law has been quoted. Please bear with us though the legislative turbulence.","Data Protection’s Roots The EU’s Data Protection Directives were introduced to eliminate potential inhibitions to trade arising from differing degrees of Data Protection in Member States. Directive 95/46 explicitly recognises the right to privacy contained in EU law and in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Breaches of that general right to Privacy are only acceptable if justified under the exceptions allowed for in Article 8 of the ECHR. See this informative posting by Thomas Otter for more background.","The Directives and the implementing Acts are intended to protect the personal data of EU citizens in a uniform manner across the EU. Personal Data is defined by Directive 95/46 Art 2(a) as","any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person","processing of data carried out by a natural person in the exercise of activities which are wholly personal or domestic, such as correspondence and the holding of addresses.","It should be clear that a PR person dealing with their address book falls outside this exemption, but that it allows for private people to keep a gmail address book, and even perhaps to check it against membership of Facebook, provided that action is entirely personal or domestic. If a person is in a business where networking or keeping connections was required for their work, it is likely that this would fall outside the remit of the above exemption.","Part of The Establishment Directives are high level legislation which set out what each member state must ensure is law in their jurisdiction. It is up to each member state to bring their laws into line with those aims in whatever form is most suitable for their legal system. In Ireland, the Data Protection Acts set out to whom their provisions apply. In Section 3B, they include entities established in the state. Facebook seems to fall within one of the definitions of an entity established in Ireland. (Section 3B (a)(ii))","makes use of equipment in the state for processing the data otherwise than for the purpose of transit through the territory of the State","I think one such piece of equipment, given the earlier quoted definition of processing as including “dissemination or otherwise making available” personal data, is sitting on my desk.","Facebook Inc already has an office in London. This also puts them within the alternate definition of “establishment” ( in the UK) in Section 3A (a) as having","an office, branch or agency through which he or she carries on any activity","But, one of the difficulties for transnational companies is that the Directive doesn’t allow them to pick just one EU country and comply with its Data Protection laws. Directive 95/46 Recital 19 puts an onus on a Data Controller established in multiple territories to fulfill the obligations of all those states.","One of Ireland’s obligations is that if a data controller is outside the EEA (which Facebook Inc is) and the data is processed inside this state (which, we’ve suggested above, happens with Facebook data) they must “designate a representative established in the State” (per the Data Protection Acts Section 3B(c)). I have not been able to find if Facebook has designated anyone as their representative in Ireland.","Consent by the person whose personal data is processed does not remove the duty to register as a data Controller or Processor.","Safe Harbour? Thomas Otter, whose excellent article on Facebook and Data Protection I linked to above, refers to Facebook Inc as claiming “safe harbour” status. This is a method by which companies and organisations working in countries which have not been deemed to have adequate protection for data may export the data of European citizens to those countries. In effect these organisations pledge to meet the requirements of the Data Protection Directives themselves.","US Companies who want this status must register with the US Department of Commerce and have a Privacy Policy which complies with the terms of the Data Protection Directives. The problem for Facebook Inc is that they seem to have grown so quickly that their systems haven’t caught up with their compliance requirements in this area. For example, as reported by Channel Four News late last year, Facebook will resist requests to delete the Personal Data it holds when asked to do so by the data subject. Alan Burlison was the source of that report, and he outlines on his blog the responses he got from Facebook, and then, following his complaints, from the UK Information Commissioner and from Truste, a 3rd party who certifies compliance with European Safe Harbour requirements.","Here’s the response he initially received;","If you deactivate, your account is removed from the site. However, we save all your profile content (friends, photos, interests, etc.), so if you want to reactivate sometime, your account will look just the way it did when you deactivated.","After Channel Four News came and interviewed him, he received a follow-up email;","We have permanently deleted your account per your request. We do not retain any information about your account once it is deleted, and thus deletion is irreversible.","This shows that compliance with the Data Protection principle that a person has a right to have information stored about them amended or erased is technically possible. It just isn’t policy. Which would put Facebook’s real data handling policies at odds with the claim to be a Safe Haven. Which in turn would raise the question of whether it is lawful for it to pass that data outsi0de EEA borders. Which, of course, is exactly what it potentially does every time a developer for the Facebook Platform creates an application.","Failure to comply with the provisions of the Data Protection Act is a criminal offence. If European users suffer a loss arising from unlawfully held personal data they would have grounds for an action against Facebook Inc. Facebook’s privacy policy shows that it is aware of the Data Protection Directives. This potential financial risk is something which they will know or ought reasonably to know about, it can be presumed. I can’t speak for Californian law, but here the common law burden of Director’s duties to their companies may leave those directors personally liable for losses which arise from a breach they ought to have reasonably avoided.","Applications, Complications","In all of this discussion, I’ve treated the Facebook Inc database as a single, unitary item. But, of course, pieces of it are passed to third parties when a Facebook member agrees to install an application. This agreement in total consisting of not unselecting a tickbox beside the statement “Allow [Application Name] to access my information.” It is arguable that this wouldn’t, by itself, be enough to constitute genuine consent.","Where are these third parties based? Certainly some of them are in Europe. We’re not privy to the terms of any given agreement between Facebook and an Application controller. Nonetheless, questions need to be raised about the data protection standards of the entities or people controlling these applications. Are they registered with the local Data Protection Commissioner in each state they are established? Are they all registered as Safe Harbours if they are based in the US? If not, what liability may attach to the developers or their employers arising from these applications in the case of any future claims?","Endnote Data Protection law is a relatively new field. There is not a great deal of caselaw clarifying these matters. This puts anyone trying to apply it to a real world situation in the unhappy position of attempting to interpret the legislation- a task best left to judges. Nothing I say here should be taken as legal advice.","THE VIEWS AND COMMENTS EXPRESSED HEREIN ARE THOSE OF, AND PERSONAL TO, THE WRITER, AND ARE INTENDED FOR GENERAL DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY.

If a person is in a business where networking or keeping connections was required for their work, it is likely that this would fall outside the remit of the above exemption.","I wonder if the courts would view 5000 friends as a “domestic” matter, never mind the testing an application bit in the incident to which I referred…","Interesting post – thank you.

This past weekend, Facebook took out full-page ads in major newspapers apologizing for a, quote, \"breach of trust.\" The company placed the ads after news broke that a political data mining firm, Cambridge Analytica, reportedly used the data of 50 million Facebook users. One person who does not buy the apology is Tim Wu. He's a former senior adviser at the Federal Trade Commission. And he was there in 2011, the last time that Facebook got in trouble for failing to keep its promises about privacy. Tim Wu is skeptical that the company will change its ways anytime soon.","TIM WU: The problem the FTC was confronting was the problem, similar to now, that there were a number of abusive apps that you installed, and then they did a lot more with your data than you thought they were. And one of the big problems is that Facebook gave you the impression that you could control your own privacy by, you know, setting the settings in certain ways, but those settings didn't do anything. They were, like, fake buttons.","KING: Why even put them up if they were fake, just to give people a sense of security?","WU: Yes, or - you know, they prevented some things, but the apps were very easily capable of getting around the settings. So they promised to fix it all up. They entered in a big consent decree. They agreed to audits every two years for the next 20 years and a massive privacy probe. It was all going to be different. But the problem didn't go away. In fact, those little settings remained fake. The survey app that we - really, created by Cambridge Analytica - was able to take the data of people's friends and family and take it all for itself even though Facebook was supposedly not allowing that. So that is the problem. They've basically broken the promise they made to the country in 2011 and the promises they kept making to everybody through these privacy settings. And I think that's the core of the problem.","KING: Why does Facebook continue breaking its promises? Aren't they afraid that they'll get hammered by the FTC if they don't shape up?","WU: I think they clearly did not make it a priority. Let's put it that way. And I think that period, 2012 to 2015, was one where they were obsessed with revenue generation. And the fact is that privacy - it's like kryptonite to their business model. You know, they have to be able to promise their advertisers that they have the goods on everyone and they have the power to manipulate people. And so if they are also extremely tight on privacy, that tends to throw a wrench into the machine.","KING: Many of us use Facebook, and we want to keep using Facebook. And Facebook is a business. So what exactly is the fix here?","WU: I think the problem lies here. It's actually a very fundamental one, which is Facebook is always in the position of serving two masters. If its actual purpose was just trying to connect friends and family, and it didn't have a secondary motive of trying to also prove to another set of people that it could gather as much data as possible and make it possible to manipulate or influence or persuade people, then it wouldn't be a problem. For example, if they were a nonprofit, it wouldn't be a problem. But they...","KING: But they're not, right? (Laughter).","WU: They're not. But, well, that's the problem. I think there's a sort of intrinsic problem with having for-profit entities with this business model in this position of so much public trust because they're always at the edge because their profitability depends on it.","KING: Let me ask you - Facebook runs afoul of the FTC. Can the FTC seek damages for that violation? Can they fine Facebook?","WU: Yes, they can. Every single violation is punishable by a $40,000 fine. So it could be billions of dollars in damages if the FTC decides to police this very aggressively.","KING: Do you think Mark Zuckerberg is sincere in his apologies? He appeared on television. He seemed really concerned by what had happened. Are you buying it?","WU: He's the kind of guy who tends to decide how he should feel and then feel that way. I think at the heart of this company is something rotten, is some overwhelming ambition to be the biggest, most powerful company out there. And it's because they're running fast and hard, trying to break things and handling stuff that's almost like radioactive material - people's data - I think more mistakes are going to happen. I don't think we're at the end of it unless they fundamentally change their business model.","KING: And fundamentally, that would make them a less successful business. So they are not likely to, are they?","WU: Well, if Mark Zuckerberg is telling the truth when he says, what I care about is connecting people to their families and friends, that's a very lofty ambition. If that's what he really wants to do, he can do it. But it doesn't mean he'll be the most profitable company in the world. You know, utilities - which is what Facebook is, a social utility - have never been understood as profit centers before.","KING: Right.","WU: And there's a reason. The social sphere is a little bit different. And maybe we need to accept that it's not a source of major profit to be in people's personal lives.","KING: We've talked a lot about what you think Facebook's responsibilities are and some moves that they could make. What about just straight-up government regulation? What would regulating Facebook look like even if Facebook didn't 100 percent like it or want it?","WU: So there's two major ways this could happen, and they all revolve around the idea that personal data is very sensitive. You know, it's almost like radioactive waste or something. You can't just dump it all over the place, right? And that's basically what Facebook has been doing. And now we're finding out, hey, it's kind of dangerous when we let people, completely unregulated, handle this stuff. So they need to be a fiduciary, be a trustee when it comes to the personal data of their customers. They need to be under very strong legal duties to handle that stuff carefully and properly and not, for example, allow it to be given out to random researchers without even anonymizing it or really making sure it doesn't get stolen. You know, they didn't take any serious measures to prevent it from being stolen. And that's where regulation would go.","KING: What do you think a realistic future looks like for Facebook?","WU: I think a time of reckoning is coming. I think they need new management, frankly. Yes, I do. I don't think this management is doing what they say that they're promising, which is putting people's privacy first. They've been saying that for years. They're not actually doing it. Either that - they can stay the same, then they need to be under a lot more government supervision if we're going to trust them.","KING: Tim Wu is a professor at Columbia Law School. He was a senior adviser at the Federal Trade Commission.

According to Facebook, \"in 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login\" to Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie. Facebook says that about 270,000 people who downloaded Kogan's app, called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" gave permission for Kogan to access information about them, such as their locations and posts they liked -- but Kogan violated the rules by sharing it. Kogan disputes Facebook's claim that he lied about why he was collecting the data.","Wylie helped to found Cambridge Analytica but left in 2014, and now says the firm wrongly used the data to build psychological profiles of 50 million Americans for the Trump campaign.","\"Cambridge Analytica will try to pick at whatever mental weakness or vulnerability that we think you have and try to warp your perception of what's real around you,\" Wylie said in an interview with ABC News. \"If you are looking to create an information weapon, the battle space you operate in is social media. That is where the fight happens.\"","Facebook says it thought the third parties with whom Kogan shared the data had deleted it in response to the social media company's demands, but has now learned they didn't. Cambridge Analytica said in a statement on Saturday that it deleted the data Kogan provided when it became clear that Kogan had not gathered it in line with Facebook's terms of service.","Read More","JUST WATCHED","Ex-employee blows the whistle on data firm","MUST WATCH","Ex-employee blows the whistle on data firm01:38","Being profiled in this way by a political campaign is different than being targeted by a company selling shoes, for example, with a Facebook ad. While companies may select Facebook users based upon generic data such as what school they graduated from or what zip code they live in, industry practices prevent advertisers from knowing the personal identities of the people they're targeting. Congress needs to respond now -- in two ways.","First, we need laws that give Americans more information about how data we share online will be used. As I've argued before, organizations asking us to share personally identifiable information on social media should be required to say who they are, from whom they get funding, and how they're going to use the data. This stipulation could help prevent situations like this in the future.","Second, Congress should force Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify about what happened. This could shed some light on the shady way this all played out, helping lawmakers figure out how to prevent such episodes from recurring. It would also rightly publicly shame the company for failing to live up to moral obligations it had to its users to be forthcoming and transparent about what it knew.","It's unconscionable that Facebook didn't reveal what happened in 2015, when the company now says it first found out about it. Facebook had both legal and moral obligations to disclose all of this at that time. Although Facebook chose not to inform users in 2015, the company announced Monday that it had hired a digital forensic firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica's servers and systems in an effort to show that it deleted certain data on some American users. A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment about the audit.","The people whose data was shared without their permission had a right to know about it. Ann Ravel, an attorney who was previously chair of the Federal Election Commission, told me in an interview that the fact that Facebook didn't disclose the problem earlier violates laws in most states requiring companies to notify people of such breaches.","Facebook also had a civic responsibility to tell Americans what was going on. The use of personally identifiable information (PII) in this way is widely eschewed by the advertising industry. The principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance -- a non-profit group made up of industry organizations including the Better Business Bureau, 4A's and Association of National Advertisers -- require companies to \"give clear, meaningful, and prominent notice\" about how they collect and use data.","Clearly, the Americans who shared information about themselves on the \"thisisyourdigitallife\" app didn't know it would end up in the hands of political consultants. If Facebook had disclosed before the 2016 election that a firm used by Trump was employing such dirty tactics, it likely could have changed the decisions of some voters at the ballot box.","On Monday, crisis expert Eric Dezenhall argued on CNBC that it's unfair that Trump is being criticized for using social media in new ways, since President Obama did, too. That argument is ridiculous, of course, since the Obama campaign was never accused of using deceptive practices to obtain data. Obama was the first presidential candidate to fully exploit social media platforms to communicate with voters; Trump tweeted constantly on the campaign trail, but his team is now accused of using unethical and widely disavowed practices to obtain information about potential voters.","An earlier disclosure by Facebook could have also flagged possible violations of the law. Ravel noted that Federal Trade Commission rules state that \"access to and disclosure of PII ... must be strictly limited to individuals with an official need to know.\" Furthermore, Cambridge Analytica is an affiliate of a British firm. Although Cambridge Analytica has not made a public statement about the audit or its international status, it's not legal for foreigners to work on political campaigns in the United States.","A timely announcement by Facebook could have brought these issues to light -- and could have influenced the decisions voters made on Election Day. While ads may promote products or even politicians based upon demographic information, it's widely recognized that it's not okay to use personally identifiable information about Americans without our permission. Disclosure of such dubious practices could have also sparked more timely action by regulators. Lawmakers need to prevent the company from getting away with such secrecy again. They should start by summoning Zuckerberg to Capitol Hill."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

{"originalurl":"https://newrepublic.com/article/117878/information-fiduciary-solution-facebook-digital-gerrymandering","title":"Information Fiduciary: Solution to Facebook digital gerrymandering | The New Republic","text":["Facebook Could Decide an Election Without Anyone Ever Finding Out","The scary future of digital gerrymandering—and how to prevent it","June 2, 2014","On November 2, 2010, Facebook’s American users were subject to an ambitious experiment in civic-engineering: Could a social network get otherwise-indolent people to cast a ballot in that day’s congressional midterm elections?","The answer was yes.","The prod to nudge bystanders to the voting booths was simple. It consisted of a graphic containing a link for looking up polling places, a button to click to announce that you had voted, and the profile photos of up to six Facebook friends who had indicated they’d already done the same. With Facebook’s cooperation, the political scientists who dreamed up the study planted that graphic in the newsfeeds of tens of millions of users. (Other groups of Facebook users were shown a generic get-out-the-vote message or received no voting reminder at all.) Then, in an awesome feat of data-crunching, the researchers cross-referenced their subjects’ names with the day’s actual voting records from precincts across the country to measure how much their voting prompt increased turnout.","Overall, users notified of their friends’ voting were 0.39 percent more likely to vote than those in the control group, and any resulting decisions to cast a ballot also appeared to ripple to the behavior of close Facebook friends, even if those people hadn’t received the original message. That small increase in turnout rates amounted to a lot of new votes. The researchers concluded that their Facebook graphic directly mobilized 60,000 voters, and, thanks to the ripple effect, ultimately caused an additional 340,000 votes to be cast that day. As they point out, George W. Bush won Florida, and thus the presidency, by 537 votes—fewer than 0.01 percent of the votes cast in that state.","Now consider a hypothetical, hotly contested future election. Suppose that Mark Zuckerberg personally favors whichever candidate you don’t like. He arranges for a voting prompt to appear within the newsfeeds of tens of millions of active Facebook users—but unlike in the 2010 experiment, the group that will not receive the message is not chosen at random. Rather, Zuckerberg makes use of the fact that Facebook “likes” can predict political views and party affiliation, even beyond the many users who proudly advertise those affiliations directly. With that knowledge, our hypothetical Zuck chooses not to spice the feeds of users unsympathetic to his views. Such machinations then flip the outcome of our hypothetical election. Should the law constrain this kind of behavior?","The scenario imagined above is an example of digital gerrymandering. All sorts of factors contribute to what Facebook or Twitter present in a feed, or what Google or Bing show us in search results. Our expectation is that those intermediaries will provide open conduits to others’ content and that the variables in their processes just help yield the information we find most relevant. (In that spirit, we expect that advertiser-sponsored links and posts will be clearly labeled so as to make them easy to distinguish from the regular ones.) Digital gerrymandering occurs when a site instead distributes information in a manner that serves its own ideological agenda. This is possible on any service that personalizes what users see or the order in which they see it, and it’s increasingly easy to effect.","There are plenty of reasons to regard digital gerrymandering as such a toxic exercise that no right-thinking company would attempt it. But none of these businesses actually promises neutrality in its proprietary algorithms, whatever that would mean in practical terms. And they have already shown themselves willing to leverage their awesome platforms to attempt to influence policy. In January 2012, for example, Google blacked out its home page “doodle” as a protest against the pending Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), said by its opponents (myself among them) to facilitate censorship. The altered logo linked to an official blog entry importuning Google users to petition Congress; SOPA was ultimately tabled, just as Google and many others had wanted. A social-media or search company looking to take the next step and attempt to create a favorable outcome in an election would certainly have the means.","So what’s stopping that from happening? The most important fail-safe is the threat that a significant number of users, outraged by a betrayal of trust, would adopt alternative services, hurting the responsible company’s revenue and reputation. But while a propagandistic Google doodle or similarly ideological alteration to a common home page lies in plain view, newsfeeds and search results have no baseline. They can be subtly tweaked without hazarding the same backlash. Indeed, in our get-out-the-vote hypothetical, the people with the most cause for complaint are those who won’t be fed the prompt and may never know it existed. Not only that, but the disclosure policies of social networks and search engines already state that the companies reserve the right to season their newsfeeds and search results however they like. An effort to sway turnout could be construed as being covered by the existing agreements and require no special notice to users.","At the same time, passing new laws to prevent digital gerrymandering would be ill advised. People may be due the benefits of a democratic electoral process. But in the United States, content curators appropriately have a First Amendment right to present their content as they see fit. Meddling with how a company gives information to its users, especially when no one’s arguing that the information in question is false, is asking for trouble. (That’s one reason why the European Court of Justice got it wrongwhen it opened the door to people censoring the search-engine results for their names, validating a so-called “right to be forgotten.”)","There’s a better solution available: enticing Web companies entrusted with personal data and preferences to act as “information fiduciaries.” Champions of the concept include Jack Balkin of Yale Law School, who sees a precedent in the way that lawyers and doctors obtain sensitive information about their clients and patients—and are then not allowed to use that knowledge for outside purposes. Balkin asks, “Should we treat certain online businesses, because of their importance to people’s lives, and the degree of trust and confidence that people inevitably must place in these businesses, in the same way?”","As things stand, Web companies are simply bound to follow their own privacy policies, however flimsy. Information fiduciaries would have to do more. For example, they might be required to keep automatic audit trails reflecting when the personal data of their users is shared with another company, or is used in a new way. (Interestingly, the kind of ledger that crypto-currencies like Bitcoin use to track the movement of money could be adapted to this function.) They would provide a way for users to toggle search results or newsfeeds to see how that content would appear without the influence of reams of personal data—that is, non-personalized. And, most important, information fiduciaries would forswear any formulas of personalization derived from their own ideological goals. Such a system could be voluntary, in the way that businesspeople who make suggestions on buying and selling stocks and bonds can elect between careers as investment advisers or brokers: the “advisers” owe duties not to put their own interests above those of their clients, while the “brokers” have no such duty, even as they—confusingly—can go by such titles as financial adviser, financial consultant, wealth manager, and registered representative. (If someone’s telling you how to handle your nest egg, you might ask flat out whether he or she is your fiduciary and walk swiftly to the exit if the answer is no.)","Constructed correctly, the duties of the information fiduciary would be limited enough for the Facebooks and Googles of the world, while meaningful enough to the people who rely on the services, that the intermediaries could be induced to opt into them. To provide further incentive, the government could offer tax breaks or certain legal immunities for those willing to step up toward an enhanced duty to their users. My search results and newsfeed might still end up different from yours based on our political leanings, but only because the algorithm is trying to give me what I want—the way that an investment adviser may recommend stocks to the reckless and bonds to the sedate—and never because the search engine or social network is trying to covertly pick election winners.","Four decades ago, another emerging technology had Americans worried about how it might be manipulating them. In 1974, amid a panic over the possibility of subliminal messages in TV advertisements, the Federal Communications Commission strictly forbade that kind of communication. There was a foundation for the move; historically, broadcasters have accepted a burden of evenhandedness in exchange for licenses to use the public airwaves. The same duty of audience protection ought to be brought to today’s dominant medium. As more and more of what shapes our views and behaviors comes from inscrutable, artificial-intelligence-driven processes, the worst-case scenarios should be placed off limits in ways that don’t trip over into restrictions on free speech. Our information intermediaries can keep their sauces secret, inevitably advantaging some sources of content and disadvantaging others, while still agreeing that some ingredients are poison—and must be off the table."],"isopubdate":"2014-06-02"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers. Facebook said this was standard practice for large political and corporate spenders.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

This was the only one that felt creepy, even though we played by the rules, and didn't do anything I felt was ugly, with the data,' stated Davidsen.","The revelations, if true, mean that Obama's campaign used similar tactics to those of Cambridge Analytica, which worked on President Donald Trump's election campaign, and reportedly harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook users.","Members of Congress called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about Facebook's actions on Monday in the wake of the revelation.","Meanwhile, British privacy regulators are seeking a warrant to search the offices of the U.K.-based Cambridge Analytica as both US and European lawmakers demand an explanation of how the consulting firm gained access to the data.","The news also saw Facebook shares closed down nearly 7.0 percent on Monday, wiping nearly $40 billion off its market value as investors worried that new legislation could damage the company's advertising business.","Members of Congress called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about Facebook's actions on Monday in the wake of the revelations about Cambridge Analytica","Facebook said on Monday it had hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to investigate and determine whether Cambridge Analytical still had the data.","'Auditors from Strop Fried berg were on site at Cambridge Analytic's London office this evening,' the company said in a statement late Monday. 'At the request of the UK Information Commissioner´s Office, which has announced it is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation, the Strop Fried berg auditors stood down.'","Yet the Obama campaign may have harvested information from millions during the 2012 run.","Of course, the biggest difference is that those signing up to the Obama campaign did so knowingly. While with Cambridge Analytic, users were told they were contributing to an academic research project. That information was then passed to the Trump campaign.","But that doesn't mean the friends of the Obama supporters consented to have their details used in their data mining.","The New York Times Magazine reported how the campaign had a list of a million people who had signed into the campaign website through Facebook.","This information obtained by Cambridge Analytica is said to have been used to help elect President Donald Trump in the US, as well as to boost the Brexit campaign in the UK. CEO Alexander Nix has said the firm was 'always acquiring more' data","To do so, they were prompted to agree to grant the campaign permission to access their Facebook friends list, photos and other personal information.","Another prompt, which most people also agreed to, asked for them to grant access to their news feed.","Through these prompts, the campaign had access to millions of people, and their interests, and friends - who they could note down as potential donors, unregistered voters and persuadable votes - to target in specific campaigns.","One staffer said that once a supporter signed up through Facebook, it would take them mere seconds to go through their friends' lists, match them with votes lists, and then they would go through photos - trying to weed out old girlfriends and college friends who could share their political beliefs.","The campaign reportedly mined data from 15 million Facebook users, which triggered alarms at the social media giant, but the company always decided that the campaign had not violated its privacy and data rules.","Facebook did not respond to reporters' requests for comment.","WHAT DOES FACEBOOK KNOW ABOUT YOU?","Facebook uses personal data it collects on members using their on-site activity, location settings and internet connection to target its ads.","The firm uses 98 data points to create 'complete consumer profiles'.","Some of this data is taken from your Faebook profile information, but the social network watches online activity for the rest.","It can 'see' virtually every website you visit if you are logged into Facebook.","The 98 data points it tracks are:","1.

{"originalurl":"https://narativ.org/2017/08/20/politics-of-greed/","title":"Politics of Greed - Narativ","text":["Topics","Posts","Politics of Greed","Exclusive: With Breitbart’s Stephen Bannon out at the White House, a renewed focus on the Mercer family, who helped install Trump and its deep ties to Russia.","With reporting by Tracie McElroy","Donald J. Trump was still gushing about his capture of the Republican presidential nomination a month earlier when he met with uber political financier Rebekah Mercer at a swanky Hamptons house party on August 13th last year. For all the boasting, Trump and Mercer both knew his campaign for the White House was in deep trouble.","Weeks of sliding poll numbers had thrown the campaign into turmoil. Trump had reportedly erupted in private meetings, deriding his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, as being “low energy” (a term he’d previously reserved for rivals like Jeb Bush). As Mercer and Trump engaged in political strategy in the Hamptons, Manafort’s campaign death was hanging in the air. The New York Times was about to publish a devastating story revealing Manafort had been paid $12.7 million from Vladimir Putin’s pro-Russian party in the Ukraine.","With the Manafort political writing on the wall, Rebekah Mercer recommended Stephen Bannon, a long-time confidante of Donald Trump. People who know Bekah caution not to confuse her congeniality for flexibility. “She’s very nice and very unassuming … but she’s also no bullshit. Her style is, ‘If you want my money, you have to do things the way I want,'” a sourcetold The Hill.","By the following Wednesday, Manafort was out at the Trump campaign, and Stephen Bannon became its CEO. Kellyanne Conway was upped from campaign adviser to manager. Both have long histories connecting them to the Mercers. Rebekah and her father, Robert, funded Bannon’s anti-Clinton film “Clinton Cash”, and his alt-right Breitbart Media. “RebekahMercer has been known to indicate to people in the public policy world that she can influence Breitbart coverage where needed,” says The Hill.","With her appointments in place, Mercer money came flowing into the Trump campaign, with $17 million dollars going to the Super PAC “Make America #1”. By September, Bekah assumed control of the PAC. For all intents and purposes, the Mercers owned the campaign – financially and operationally. The same month, the Trump campaign paid the Mercer-backed Cambridge Analytica $5 million for its work targeting social news feeds through psychographics. Stephen Bannon is also an advisor to Cambridge Analytica and much of the content being pushed by it came from Breitbart. The super PAC paid Kellyanne Conway’s company $247,000 and Bannon’s production company $950,000 for their work on the campaign, which may be a felony violating election conflicts of interest rules.","Once Trump was elected, Bekah was named to the transition team and is believed to have influenced the appointments of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.","Rebekah, Robert, and Diana Mercer at the 2014 World Science Festival Gala on April 7, 2014","The Mercer fortune is closely tied to Russia and Deutsche Bank.","43-year-old Rebekah Mercer is the political operative of the family’s fortune, but her father is the source of the funds. She is his middle daughter, and ten years ago bought a bakery in Manhattan’s “Hell’s Kitchen” neighborhood with her sisters. He is a 70-year-old reclusive billionaire who owns the hedge funds Renaissance Technologies and Medallion Fund. Over the years, the father and daughter duo have become the largest political donors in Republican circles. It’s worth noting that Renaissance’s other partners are equally generous to Democratic circles.","Mercer’s funds have always had close connections to Russia – both in staffing and business. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many of Russia’s top scientists fled the country to find cushy jobs in the U.S., and some of them landed at Mercer’s funds. In 2003, two of them, Pavel Volfbeyn and Alexander Belopolsky, departed the company. Insiders at the fund were caught by surprise when another Russian, Alexey Kononenko, was elevated over them. “People with knowledge of the firm say Kononenko’s promotion was a significant event in Renaissance’s history and that the Russian had actually executed a power play,” according to Bloomberg.","Very little is known about how Renaissance makes so much money, but it has a Midas touch like no other, making money in good times and bad. It operates quantum trading computers programmed by some of the world’s most brilliant scientists, many of whom are Russian. That means machines do all the trading based on algorithms, executing millions of trades in milliseconds. They can drive the stock market up and down with very little, if any, human interference. The machines place bets on whether prices will go up or down and make profit when their bets are right.","Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) shakes hands with ex-Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Josef Ackermann (L) and the head of Knauf Group Nikolaus Wilhelm Knauf in 2010. Ackerman would go on to join the Russian owned Bank of Cyprus, largely thought of as a money laundering operation for Russia. Bank of Cyprus’ former Vice Chair is Wilbur Ross, Trump’s Commerce Secretary.","Vladimir Putin and Russia’s energy sector is linked to Deutsche Bank.","Nine years ago, with Russia reeling from economic failure and rising foreign debt, Vladimir Putin authorized the State’s development bank, VEB, to start issuing bailouts to key Russian oligarchs, including Mikhail Fridman’s Alfa Bank and Oleg Deripaska’s United Company RUSAL. The $50 billion dollars in loans came with strings. “The major question is the price [they] will have to pay for such generosity,” analyst Troika Dialogsaid. In Russia, that means one thing: loyalty to Vladimir Putin.","The Russian firms who received the bailouts from VEB became organs of the state, allowing the Kremlin to cut off energy supplies to countries it wanted to annex, like the Ukraine, or for other foreign misadventures. Alfa, you’ll recall, is deeply tied to the Trump-Russia scandal through a server in Trump Tower. VEB’s CEO had a secret meeting with Jared Kushner last December, and Oleg Deripaska, who is tied to organized crime in the US and Russia’s richest man, paid Paul Manafort 10 million dollars a year between 2006-2009 to supportVladimir Putin’s political interests in the Ukraine and the US.","The other main stakeholder in the bailout was Deutsche Bank. The Bank is deeply tied to Russia’s energy sector and is the also the prime broker for Mercer’s Renaissance Technologies. Mercer’s fund takes large bets on energy price and Deutsche facilitates them. “Energy is indeed the largest speculative market with billions made and lost daily”, says Bill Parish.”[Mercer’s] Renaissance simply speculates on stocks and commodities and does millions of transactions with Deutsche Bank each year.”","Jared Kushner and Donald Trump during a news conference at the Trump National Golf Club Westchester in 2016. Mary Altaffer/AP Photo","Donald Trump owes $300 million to Deutsche Bank with no obvious means to pay it off. As Trump was fast approaching bankruptcy, as was his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump decided to launch his White House bid as a way to rescue his fortune.","Deutsche Bank is by any standard a bad corporate entity. The bank was recently fined $10 billion for its role in a Russian money-laundering scheme. The bank was also heavily involved in financing the vastly over-budget 2014 Sochi Olympics (itself a Russian money laundering scheme). In 2014, Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Carl Levin (D-MI) launched a congressional investigation into Mercer and Deutsche Bank’s illegal tax evasion scheme.","The Moscow Exchange is tied to Rebekah’s ex-husband, Sylvain Michel Mirochnikoff. The market rallied after the election of Donald J. Trump and the sale of 19.5% of Rosneft in December.","Rebekah Mercer’s husband is directly linked to the Moscow Exchange, which rises and falls on world events.","Then there’s Rebekah Mercer’s husband, Sylvain Michel Mirochnikoff, who until recently shared an apartment with her in a Trump-branded building on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. They are now getting divorced.","Mirochnikoff is a Morgan Stanley broker. In 2012, he joined the board of the International Security Exchange, which buys and sell stocks electronically. The following year the ISE partnered with the Moscow exchange to “share information”. If you’re in the business of placing bets on the futures of stocks (especially energy stocks), which Mercer’s Renaissance Technologies is, a family member with an inside track to Russia’s exchange could be very profitable. When Russia invaded Crimea in 2013, for example, the Moscow Exchange rallied. As Putin cut off gas supplies to the Ukraine from Russia’s state-run oil and energy companies, Mercer, Mirochnikoff and Oleg Deripaska were all making money off the crisis.","The same thing happened late last year. The Moscow Exchange rallied after Trump’s election in November and the sale of 19.5% of Russian oil giant Rosneft in December (see chart). As Trump’s presidency has faltered, so has the Moscow Exchange.","The Mercers have become accustomed to making money by making “knowledgeable” bets on the future of stock prices. Through Russia, Deutsche Bank and Mirochnikoff, they had an inside track on world events that would move the markets and could easily react to them, particularly in the energy sector. By funding and staffing the Trump campaign, and manipulating people’s fears through Cambridge Analytica and Breitbart, they were able to install a financially imperiled president who was not only beholden to their chief financial partner, Deutsche Bank, but could also imitate Vladimir Putin’s strategy of manipulating world events to turn a profit.","5 thoughts on “Politics of Greed”","May US courts under the RICO statute tear Mercer Kochs and the Oligarchs that have developed the GOP into their own private stable of serfs.\nWhen treason is the game.. no amount of money will protect you or your billions from US Justice.","The Emperor has no clothes.

They would then use that data to do things like append their email lists.","“They came to office in the days following election recruiting & were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side,” Davidsen tweeted.","Douglas Graham /CQ Roll Call/Getty","She added that she believes Facebook also recruits people “on the other side” too:","I am also 100% positive that Facebook activity recruits and staffs people that are on the other side.","Davidsen began the tweet thread with a link to a Time article outlining the Obama campaign's Facebook targeting campaign, which she said was codenamed “Project Taargus”:","That’s because the more than 1 million Obama backers who signed up for the [Facebook-based app] gave the campaign permission to look at their Facebook friend lists. In an instant, the campaign had a way to see the hidden young voters. Roughly 85% of those without a listed phone number could be found in the uploaded friend lists. What’s more, Facebook offered an ideal way to reach them. “People don’t trust campaigns. They don’t even trust media organizations,” says Goff. “Who do they trust? Their friends.”","The campaign called this effort targeted sharing. And in those final weeks of the campaign, the team blitzed the supporters who had signed up for the app with requests to share specific online content with specific friends simply by clicking a button. More than 600,000 supporters followed through with more than 5 million contacts, asking their friends to register to vote, give money, vote or look at a video designed to change their mind. A geek squad in Chicago created models from vast data sets to find the best approaches for each potential voter. “We are not just sending you a banner ad,” explains Dan Wagner, the Obama campaign’s 29-year-old head of analytics, who helped oversee the project. “We are giving you relevant information from your friends.”","Facebook did not immediately respond to IJR's request for comment.

{"originalurl":"https://qz.com/1234829/california-has-a-plan-to-police-facebook/","title":"If Facebook can't protect user data, California lawmakers may step in — Quartz","text":["California has a plan to police Facebook","Silicon Valley operates in a regulatory Wild West. But with repeated and high-profile data breaches piling up, its days of unchecked authority might be numbered.","Because internet technology has developed faster than state and federal privacy laws, Silicon Valley companies have for years been in charge of how the data they collect from their customers is used. Anyone browsing the web, performing a search on Google, or logging into Facebook operates on blind faith that the companies behind the technology will protect their private data and use it appropriately.","But history has shown that faith-based system isn’t exactly working. Yahoo user data was breached in 2013, 2014, and 2016. There was a massive breach of sensitive Equifax data in 2017. And Facebook is currently embroiled in a scandal over how its user data was used by right-wing political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Indeed, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reportedly investigating whether the social media giant violated an agreement over privacy it made in 2011.","California data protection law","That most recent case has reignited conversations about whether federal and state governments should exert more oversight over so-called Big Tech. The willingness to do so will first be tested in coming months in Silicon Valley’s backyard, as a piece of legislation makes its way through California’s state capitol in Sacramento. First introduced in February by assemblyman Marc Levine, the legislation seeks to establish a data protection authority that would be charged with regulating how big tech companies request and use Californians’ personal data. The regulated data would include people’s names, social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, financial account data, medical data, and email addresses, among other information.","“These are the wealthiest corporations since God created light.”","If passed by the legislature and signed into law by governor Jerry Brown, the authority would be an important and symbolic step toward reining in the power of technology companies. It would also be a bold signal by California to Washington that if federal lawmakers won’t step up to the challenge of monitoring giant technology companies, California will take matters into its own hands.","“Given that Facebook is in California and the questions about whether there’s enough regulation of internet giants, maybe this could be a big thing,” says Eric Goldman, the co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law.","The author of the bill certainly thinks so. Once a project manager for an open source encryption technology product, Levine switched gears in the mid-2000s and got into local politics. In 2012, he was elected to the California state legislature, where he represents communities in Marin and southern Sonoma. Now he’s readying to shepherd the idea of the California Data Protection Authority through the legislature.","“These are the wealthiest, most profitable corporations in all of world history, since God created light,” Levine says. “For lawmakers, or even consumers of social media, to be hoodwinked into thinking that these are geeky college kids in garages, wearing hoodies and jamming on their keyboards writing code, is absolute garbage. These are the richest special interests ever and we have to get a handle on this.”","Modeled on the EU","Levine’s bill (AB 2182) was loosely designed in the image of a new law in the European Union called General Data Protection Regulation. That law put into place constraints on how tech companies can use people’s data, backed by very high penalties for violators—up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is higher. The proposed California authority would have the power to adopt regulations that would set data-privacy standards for the tech companies that operate just a few miles south of Levine’s district. Some of those include:","Creating a standardized online user agreement aimed at helping people clearly understand what permissions they are giving to a company regarding the use and dissemination of their personal information.","Establishing rules around how a person’s information will be removed from a company’s database if the person chooses to stop being a customer.","“I think this is important for where it may lead,” says Ari Waldman, the director of the New York Law School’s Innovation Center for Law and Technology. “It’s a baby step in the right direction. We undoubtedly need a data protection authority in this country above and beyond the FTC.”","“It’s a baby step in the right direction.”","If the regulatory authority is established in California, it’s conceivable that any rules it imposes could set data-privacy policy for the rest of the nation. That’s because it’s difficult for companies to quickly ascertain whether any one particular piece of data comes from California or someplace else. Therefore, in order to comply with California law, companies would likely have to adopt nationwide standards based on the actions of California regulators, Waldman says.","No enforcement powers","Still, the proposed law is imperfect. Even if the state establishes a regulatory authority to monitor data privacy, the wording of the bill is such that the agency would have no enforcement powers. Levine says he plans to speak to the governor to request money be set aside for his proposed authority—something in the “seven figure” range (he suggested about $7 million) to get it started, and then more down the line.","The Consumer Technology Association declined to comment for this story. A representative with the California Technology Council said his group had held several meetings to discuss the proposed legislation, but declined to offer further comment. Both groups represent the interests of technology companies.","It’s still early. The bill needs to be approved by at least one state assembly committee before it’s put up to vote. It has been referred to the committee on privacy and consumer protection but has yet to be formally debated.","“I think a lot of people, including lawmakers, are dazzled by the industry leaders of Big Tech,” Levine says. “If you’ve ever seen someone take a tour of the Googleplex or the Facebook office, it’s like it’s a Disneyland, a place of wonder. We need to dispel that in Sacramento.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}
{"originalurl":"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/428530/facebook-the-real-presidential-swing-state/","title":"Facebook: The Real Presidential Swing State - MIT Technology Review","text":["Why we made this change","Visitors are allowed 3 free articles per month (without a subscription), and private browsing prevents us from counting how many stories you've read. We hope you understand, and consider subscribing for unlimited online access.","Facebook: The Real Presidential Swing State","The outcome of the 2012 campaign could have less to do with grand vision than with online data analytics and peer-to-peer voter targeting.","Facebook and Internet campaign strategies grew up at the same time. In 2003 and early 2004, when Facebook was a new dorm-room plaything, Howard Dean’s presidential campaign pioneered Internet fund-­raising. By 2008, Facebook had crossed the 100-million-user mark and was coming to dominate online social networking; that year, Barack Obama’s campaign wielded a custom social-networking site that helped win the White House (see “How Obama Really Did It”). A Facebook cofounder, Chris Hughes, helped build that site.","Now, in 2012, Facebook is central to the upcoming presidential election. Both Obama and his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, are well aware that half or more of the electorate is on Facebook. Both campaigns’ websites are entwined with Facebook pages; visitors are encouraged to log in with their Facebook accounts and then post messages supporting the candidates for their friends to see. What Facebook also gives the candidates is an arena for testing, analyzing, and distributing precisely targeted political advertising. Both campaigns can also use Facebook to urge their supporters to vote and, potentially, to lobby their undecided friends in swing states. That means this is where the 2012 election might be won or lost—even if far more money will be spent elsewhere, especially on TV ads.","Making use of social connections can lead to the ideal form of marketing: individual messages of persuasion delivered by trusted friends. You can see the president’s campaign reaching for this goal with Obama 2012, an app that his supporters can use to integrate their Facebook accounts with the campaign’s website. The app’s avowed task is to give people a quick and easy way to access the volunteering and organizing functions that worked so well for Obama in 2008. But the permission screen that comes with the app makes clear that it has another purpose as well. When I installed the app, I noticed that it said it would grab information about my friends: their birthdates, locations, and “likes.”","Facebook’s policies require that such data be used in only the context of the app itself, but even so, the campaign should be able to create tools that prompt supporters to approach voting-age friends in swing states and craft personalized appeals based on what the campaign can infer about those friends’ interests and views. Similar tools are coming from other quarters, too. In July NGP VAN, a company in Somerville, Massachusetts, that maintains a database on all registered U.S. voters and helps Democratic candidates access the data, released a Facebook app called Social Organizing. The app lets Democratic volunteers log in with Facebook and match their friends with voters in the database. Like the Obama app, NGP VAN’s makes it possible for candidates to execute a peer-to-peer persuasion strategy using Facebook.","So don’t be surprised—especially if you live in a state that is considered up for grabs, such as Ohio or Florida—if you hear from an old college friend with a political pitch based on what the campaign thinks is important to you, as suggested by your Facebook data. If you’ve “liked” a page blaming Obama for high gas prices, you might be reminded about his pro-drilling positions.","Don’t be surprised if you hear from an old friend with a pitch based on what the campaign thinks is important to you. If you’ve “liked” a page ­blaming Obama for high gas prices, you might be reminded about his pro-drilling positions.","The Obama campaign didn’t respond to requests for an interview about its plans, but Joe Trippi, the Democratic strategist who pioneered Internet fund-raising for Dean in 2003 and 2004, expects that the campaign will use sophisticated methods to determine how and when to encourage peer-to-peer appeals in the final weeks of the race. “What’s most important in terms of being able to reach people is to know not only that the voter is undecided—and also what issues, what is holding them up from crossing the line—but who their friends are in the network that might be able to talk to them,” he says. “And then get those friends the information that says, ‘We need you to talk to your friend in Pennsylvania about these three issues that matter most to them.’ This is a field organizer’s dream.” Certainly it is more than Trippi could have dreamed of as a $15-a-day campaign worker knocking on doors in Jones County, Iowa, for Senator Edward Kennedy in 1979, carrying shoeboxes of index cards indicating whether voters said they supported ­Kennedy for the next year’s Democratic presidential nomination.","The Romney campaign’s website also encourages supporters to log in using Facebook, but it requests permission only to view the individual user’s information—not information about the user’s friends “right now,” says the Romney campaign’s digital director, Zac Moffatt. The same is true for the Republican National Committee’s Facebook app. This may change, though, because the Republicans share Trippi’s view. “I think you will start to see, on our side, that app permissions will get changed,” says a Republican digital strategist who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Republicans are working on apps that take advantage of all the things in the Facebook social graph.”","How much information can the campaigns glean this way? Consider that the average friend count on Facebook is 190. As of early August, more than 150,000 people were using the Obama 2012 app. Multiply those numbers and you get more than 28 million people. Now, surely many friend lists overlap, and many of those people aren’t even voters. And some users block the ability of apps like Obama’s to gather information about them when their friends install the programs (a Consumer Reports study, however, found that only 37 percent of users touch app settings). But even if these factors make 90 percent of Obama supporters’ friends useless to the campaign, the president’s campaign app would still have intelligence on 2.8 million American voters who didn’t necessarily take any explicit action to share it.","Persuading just a small percentage of those people could be crucial. In 2000, the contested election that put George W. Bush in office was determined largely by 537 votes in Florida, out of six million cast in that state. And in 2004 Bush beat John Kerry by fewer than 120,000 people out of 5.6 million who voted in Ohio. (Facebook is the virtual battleground within that battleground state. In 2012, just over five million account holders of voting age lived in Ohio—out of a total voting-age population of 8.8 million, according to Well & Lighthouse, a Democratic consulting firm.) Given math like that, the right peer-to-peer and message targeting strategies “could be the difference in swing states,” Trippi says.","Fast and on target","In addition to any peer-to-peer strategies they might employ, the candidates are already waging online advertising campaigns that are more scientifically designed and demographically precise than the ones Obama and John McCain deployed in 2008. Political operatives can now rapidly test ad copy across multiple demographics, getting strategic insights within hours. They can even keep track of exactly which ads individual computer owners have clicked on.","These abilities were brought to bear in an ad campaign that rolled out in March of 2010, when President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act—so-called Obamacare.","The midterm elections were just eight months away, and the president was concerned for a vulnerable ally, Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader. On the health care issue alone, Reid’s online strategist, Jon-David Schlough, developed 18 sets of targeted advertisements for people in different demographic groups. For example, the version geared to students pointed out that the legislation would let them keep their parents’ insurance until age 26; the one for the elderly focused on what it would do to close a Medicaid benefit gap known as the doughnut hole.","Then, for each of the 18 campaigns, different versions were tested on Facebook. Schlough says the site gave him access to a wide range of demographic groups, made it possible to place small ads at low rates, and offered easy ways to experiment rapidly with different combinations of headline, image, and text. The versions that generated the most clicks would get wider distribution on multiple websites.","Eventually, the campaign could be sure that, say, an ad about being able to stay on parental insurance plans would be shown to a specific 25-year-old four times a day for two weeks. It’s called nanotargeting, and “it’s now a component of all campaigns,” says Schlough, the founder of Well & Lighthouse. “Political types are used to large data-set analysis on things like polling data and turnout data. But the fact that so much more data is available, so much faster, is allowing us to innovate a lot quicker.”","For Reid, such innovations might have been decisive. Consider that his opponent, Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle, spent about as much as Reid and was ahead in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election. In the end, Reid won by more than 5 percentage points.","David Talbot is Technology Review’s chief correspondent.","This article was revised on August 15, 2012.","Become an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.","Share","Tagged","Credit","I’m MIT Technology Review’s senior writer, interested in a wide range of topics including climate change, energy, and information and communication technologies.

The revelations that have panicked Facebook executives and spooked its investors started at Cambridge Analytica's offices, the brainchild of now 28-year-old co-founder-turned self-proclaimed-whistleblower Christopher Wylie.","\"All of these pieces of information, put together, create a digital portrait of who you are,\" Wylie said.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Sen. Ted Cruz and President Trump's 2016 campaign. The idea was to put 2016 political advertising on steroids by targeting certain people based on very specific people.","Here's how it happened: In 2014, a company called Global Science Research (GSR) used Facebook to distribute a personality quiz to analyze whether users were extroverted or neurotic. The company said it was doing it just for research purposes, but it actually harvested the psychological data from all the users and -- with their permission -- got access to some data on their Facebook friends.","\"It scaled really quickly. We spent over $1 million on it, so it wasn't cheap but in terms of the amount of data that was collected, and the quality of that data, it was a rare example of where something was fast, relatively cheap, but high-quality, \" Wylie said.","\"I take a share of responsibility in this because I was the research director and I worked on this program so I'm going to start by saying I'm taking responsibility and I'm owning up,\" Wylie said. \"In terms of who else needs to take responsibility: Cambridge Analytica -- it funded the program, it approved the program -- as an entity this is what ultimately became the foundation of what Cambridge Analytica is.\"","Wylie added: \"Last week I offered to help Facebook and work with Facebook and their lawyers confirmed that they wanted to work in a collaborative manner -- when all of this came out I got banned [from Facebook] -- they decided that actually the whistleblower is the person they want to apparently go after.\"","Facebook said the use of the data was unauthorized. Since 2015, the company has banned third-party developers from collecting data on users friends.","But Facebook's critics say the company should have done more. David Carroll, who has filed a lawsuit to figure out exactly what information was used, believes the social media giant should bear some responsibility.","\"If they did let data get collected in an illicit manner and didn't adequately protect it when they learned how it was used, then yes, they are responsible. That's the deal they make with us, that they protect our data in order for us to use the service,\" Carroll said.","The more information a political campaign knows about you, the more they can target ads. They know your personality and they know your interests. They know your religion and how strongly you believe it, and they can target ads against those beliefs.","Users don't need to worry that their personal information will be hacked, or your bank information stolen, but Wylie has said that this information was used to create ads that turned people against each other and they were deliberately divisive."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The drop wipes more than $30 billion off Facebook's market cap.","Lawmakers in the US and the UK are examining Facebook and its role in election interference","Facebook is under huge pressure from lawmakers in the US and the UK over the way it handles user data and how that data can be manipulated for targeted political advertising.","A former Cambridge Analytica employee, Christopher Wylie, blew the whistle, saying: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on.\"","Cambridge Analytica managed to access the data after teaming up with a University of Cambridge psychology professor, Aleksandr Kogan, and his company Global Science Research in 2014. GSR had developed an app, Thisisyourdigitallife, which examined what people \"liked\" on Facebook. Cambridge Analytica and GSR paid about 270,000 people to download the app and take a personality test — but the app also siphoned off data about the users' friends.","Facebook eventually became aware of the app, and it asked GSR and Cambridge Analytica to delete all the data they held on users. But The New York Times found Cambridge Analytica still held most of the data. Facebook suspended the company from its platform on Friday, prior to the full revelations becoming public but after it had been notified that a story was being published.","And Damian Collins, the British politician overseeing a select committee investigation into fake news, said on Sunday that Cambridge Analytica had misled members of Parliament over its use of Facebook data.","He also said Facebook executives had tried to avoid tough questions over their company's role in spreading fake news and in election interference.","\"Alexander Nix denied to the Committee last month that his company had received any data from the Global Science Research company (GSR),\" he said. \"From the evidence that has been published by The Guardian and The Observer this weekend, it seems clear that he has deliberately mislead the Committee and Parliament by giving false statements.\"","He added: \"I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry. It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.

While it’s fair to criticize how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy. The facts tell a different story.","We’ve listened to feedback from people who use Facebook, experts in privacy and security, and regulators on how we can do better. We’ve devoted hundreds of people and new technology to enforce our policies better and kick bad actors off our platform. To name just a few examples:","First, it’s always been against our policy for a developer to collect data it doesn’t need to operate its app. But in the past five years we’ve significantly improved our ability to detect and prevent these violations. All apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process where developers must explain how they are going to use what they collect – before they’re allowed to even ask for it.","Second, when developers are permitted to use our platform, we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can manage or revoke those permissions at any time. We introduced this more than three years ago.","Third, we enforce our policies by banning developers from our platform, pursuing litigation to ensure any improperly collected data is deleted, and working with developers who want to make sure their apps follow the rules.","We’re not stopping here. Our privacy program, created in 2012, includes hundreds of people from a variety of teams across the company. This group works with product managers and engineers to protect people’s data, to give people information about how our features work, and to provide people control over how their data is used. This program is audited as part of a 20-year agreement we have with the US Federal Trade Commission. We’re held accountable for what we say and what we do.","Our approach reflects the laws and regulations we have to follow – both in the US and around the world – but it also reflects something more fundamental. Facebook may be successful today, but our future isn’t guaranteed without the trust of the people who choose to come here every day. It’s why we promote a culture inside Facebook that questions decisions and that is relentless in finding ways to improve.

Revelations over the weekend about its reckless sharing of user data sent its stock price plunging on Monday, and fresh calls for regulations on the social media network are looking more real than ever.","In the last few days, multipleoutlets broke various facets of the story: Facebook has known since 2015 that Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining company hired by President Trump’s election campaign, improperly obtained the personal data of 50 million of the network’s users—and the social giant failed to do much of anything about it. In a blog post on Friday, Facebook said it has suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL, while it investigates their alleged failure to comply with an agreement to delete the ill-gotten data.","Advertisement","The particulars of this case are relatively complex, but the most important thing to understand is that Facebook collects an enormous amount of data about its users, and it lost control of that data. When it found out, it asked the bad actors responsible to promise they would delete the data. Now Facebook claims that Cambridge Analytica and SCL may have failed to fulfill that promise. And whatever you do, Facebook execs say, don’t call this a “breach.”","So after years of Facebook big shots telling us to just trust them when it comes to the ways it handles our data and targets us with advertising, a third-party allegedly violated Facebook’s trust. In the past, the company has met such scandals with a mixture of outright denials and promises to change, while mostly maintaining the status quo—and its bottom line just kept growing. On Monday, early market signs showed the dam could be breaking.","This morning, Reuters reported that Facebook’s stock fell more than 4 percent in premarket trading. That trend has continued thoughout the day, with the stock down about 6.42 percent at the time of writing. Ripple effects spread to the Dow and Nasdaq as well. And analysts are warning investors to stay away from buying the dip right now. According to Reuters:","One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised ‘systemic problems’ with Facebook’s business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform...","‘We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,’ said Brian Wieser, analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group, which already has a ‘sell’ rating on a stock that rose 60 percent last year.","Wieser argued that regulatory risks for the company would intensify and enhanced use of data in advertising would be at greater risk than before.","He added, however, that it was unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the company’s business for now, with advertisers unlikely to ‘suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform.’","Advertisement","It’s true that Facebook has previously weathered similar storms by either outright denying any issues exist or promising to just keep tweaking that algorithm and rolling out new terms of service. But this time feels a bit different.","Lawmakers around the world have vocally called for regulations, hearings, and investigations into this incident over the last few days and more continue to chime in. New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone insisted on Monday that “the Energy and Commerce Committee must hold hearings soon.” That follows Minnesota Sen.

If FTC investigators decided to throw the book at Facebook, they could potentially levy “trillions of dollars” worth of fines against the company.","Advertisement","British Prime Minister Theresa May released a statement on Monday expressing her concerns about the story, and British Parliament member Damian Collins went further, saying, “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”","In the past, Zuckerberg has typically addressed controversies with long essays on his personal Facebook page and promises to do better. But so far, the CEO has been quiet about this particular controversy. We’ve reached out to Facebook to ask if it has a timeframe for when Zuckerberg plans to address this incident personally and we’ll update this post when we receive a reply.","Facebook’s growth and revenue have consistently gone up over the years, but in late January the company reported that people were spending less time on the platform and it experienced its first-ever decline in daily users.

Friday saw the social media giant get rid of Cambridge Analytica, a data firm linked to Donald Trump’s election campaign from their site. While the public wasn’t initially aware of why that happened, we didn’t have to wait long for the mystery to be solved. On Saturday, information was released which detailed the firm having played a part in the harvesting of data related to over 50 million of Facebook’s users. By the time Sunday reached its conclusion, we had found out that Joseph Chancellor, who is currently working for Facebook as a researcher, could very well be connected to the entire ordeal.","According to CNN, Chancellor is a former director of Global Science Research (GSR). Why’s this important? Well, according to claims by whistleblower Christopher Wylie, an app was developed by Wylie and Aleksandr Kogan of Cambridge University in order to harvest data from Facebook. After being harvested, the data would be funneled through none other than GSR.","The app, entitled “thisisyourdigitallife,” gathered data via personality tests which paid participants just to complete. The tests themselves required those taking them to connect the app to their Facebook profiles, thus giving the app direct access to users’ information. That information was then allegedly used to gauge the interests of voters within the US and expose them to personalized ads during the 2016 election campaign.","How big of a degree of connection Chancellor had with GSR’s harvesting of data is still in question, as Cambridge Analytica claims to have “no recollection” of any calls or emails with him. This being the case, Chancellor is still working at Facebook for the time being, while Wylie and Kogan have both been suspended due to the investigation. Facebook told CNN that they’re currently “looking into the situation.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

To win them over, executives sought to craft personal appeals drawn from information housed in the company’s extensive database of American voters.","At one point, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix decided to build a psychological profile of billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson’s stepdaughter and son-in-law and present it to Adelson — a move that would give his pitch a “wow” factor, he predicted to his employees.","“Can we pull a LOAD of data on them????” Nix asked his researchers, who followed through, according to emails provided to The Washington Post by former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie.","Adelson adviser Andy Abboud said Nix did not end up presenting the profiles when he met with the Cambridge Analytica chief executive that year.","“Generally speaking, coming in with a profile of us would not have gone over well,” Abboud told The Post in an email Friday. “They met with me I believe, but it was nothing that we found interesting, and the pitch was not compelling.”","Internal documents and interviews with former Cambridge Analytica employees illustrate how intently the company — a spinoff of a British firm — worked to win over U.S. political clients for the 2014 midterms.","At the time, the company had access to Facebook data that had been obtained by a researcher for academic purposes and improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, Facebook executives said last week. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into whether the sharing of the Facebook data violated a 2011 consent decree that governs Facebook’s privacy practices.","Nix, who was suspended this week amid the controversy, did not respond to a request for comment. But in a statement released Friday, Cambridge Analytica’s acting chief executive, Alexander Tayler, expressed regret over the firm’s handling of the Facebook data, which he said was deleted in 2015. He said the board has launched a “full and independent” investigation into the practices of the firm’s British parent company.","Late that year, Nix hosted Bannon, then-executive chairman of Breitbart News, and Texas energy investor Toby Neugebauer at a dinner at the exclusive Carlton Club in London, according to a copy of the invitation.","Over a dinner of venison, duck terrine and roasted lamb, researchers at SCL Elections presented their methodology and case studies.","Less than two months later, Nix met with hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, Neugebauer and Bannon in Palm Beach, Fla., on the sidelines of a conference hosted by the conservative group Club For Growth. Club For Growth had no record of inviting Nix to the event, officials said.","At the meeting, Neugebauer said he asked Nix to present a cost analysis of his services, knowing that this was a major concern for campaigns and donors.","“I was saying, ‘Get me the numbers,’ ” Neugebauer recalled.","In an email, Nix berated his staff for failing give him strong enough material to win over billionaires such as Adelson and Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus.","“I just cannot begin to convey how disappointed I am in you all,” Nix wrote his staff, according to documents obtained by The Post. “Please can you go the extra mile to ensure that there is a [very good] final document in my inbox.","“This is a huge opportunity to take this project to the next level and effectively corner the market,” he added.","In the summer of 2014, Cambridge Analytica succeeded in signing up as a client a super PAC created by Bolton, a Mercer ally whom Trump named this week as his new national security adviser.","The John Bolton Super PAC, led by the former diplomat and foreign policy hard-liner, paid Cambridge Analytica more than $1.1 million in the 2014 and 2016 cycles for research, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Mercer has been the largest donor to Bolton’s super PAC, giving $5 million since the 2014 cycle, according to FEC records.","Part of the work that Cambridge Analytica performed for Bolton’s super PAC was psychographic voter targeting, which the company claimed could profile voters on the basis of certain characteristics. The predictive microtargeting was based in part on data gleaned from Facebook profiles and other sources, according to documents and former Cambridge Analytica employees.","“They used the psychographic stuff, and the Facebook data was a part of that,” said a former Cambridge Analytica employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal strategy. The New York Times first reported that Cambridge Analytica harnessed its Facebook data in services it provided to the Bolton super PAC.","In notes from a July 2014 meeting to discuss the project, SCL officials noted that they were able to “harvest substantial and useful information on people from Facebook, with permission.”","The company suggested directing potential supporters to a Facebook app to collect personality profiles. It said it would merge that information with consumer and voter history data to identify and target voters.","Garrett Marquis, a Bolton spokesman, said Friday the Bolton PAC did not know of any wrongdoing by Cambridge Analytica.","“With respect to any allegations of impropriety, the John Bolton Super PAC was completely unaware of anything Cambridge Analytica did until recent press reports,” he said in a statement, adding that the super PAC has not worked with the data-science firm since 2016.","Other 2014 Cambridge Analytica clients had received support from the Mercer family, including Ending Spending Action Fund and B-PAC super PACs.","Ending Spending paid the firm $470,000 for advertising to boost the Mercer-backed GOP congressional candidate Art Robinson in Oregon, records show. An official with the organization said that Cambridge Analytica presented innovative ideas and that the super PAC had no knowledge about any improper data the firm may have used.","Internal documents show that Cambridge Analytica also provided services to politically active nonprofit organizations that are not required to disclose their donors, including theColorado-based antiabortion group Centennial Coalition and For America, led by L. Brent Bozell, who founded the Mercer-backed Media Research Center.","After the election, Cambridge Analytica drafted detailed memos for its clients with recommendations for the 2016 cycle, according to records provided to The Post.","“A lot of Cambridge Analytica’s work in 2014 was to sort of hone their activities for 2016,” the former employee said.","The firm’s 2016 revenue reflects the success of that strategy.","In the 2014 cycle, GOP congressional campaigns and conservative-leaning groups paid at least $729,000 to the firm for a range of services, including research, data analytics and microtargeting.","In the 2016 cycle, when Cambridge Analytica worked for both Trump and GOP White House hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), it earned at least $15.4 million, FEC records show."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-24"}

They are written in the short, deadening sentences suggestive of common sense. They include a smidgen of vague contritition and the promise to do better. They seem entirely reasonable. But their chief attribute is the skill with which the business of Facebook is distilled into the simplest and most innocuous of terms. There is no obfuscation through deliberate complexity – like the best spin, the language used trumpets its own clarity.","Questions","The Facebook chief executive is almost as fond of the phrase “I want to be clear” as Theresa May is of “let me be clear”. And yet the social media giant finds itself accused of having misled a UK House of Commons committee that had pressed it on how companies accessed user data and if information had been taken without users’ consent: Damian Collins, the MP who chairs this committee, claims Facebook “deliberately avoided answering straight questions” through the time-honoured manner of sending uninformed lieutenants.","His headline-making call upon Zuckerberg to “stop hiding behind his Facebook page” has gained traction, in part because a similar frustration has been building across the Atlantic. In November, when a US Senate judiciary committee held hearings into Russian interference in the presidential election, it had to suffice with visits from the most senior lawyers of Facebook, Google and Twitter, rather than, as one senator put it, “the top people who are actually making the decisions”.","Let’s have a closer look at some of Facebook’s recent decision-making. On Friday night, in a post with the byline of its deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, it announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, a political data analytics company that worked for Donald Trump’s election team and the winning Brexit campaign.","This was Facebook getting its spoke in ahead of the publication of whistleblower-assisted investigations by the Observer and New York Times concerning the mining of tens of millions of Facebook profile data for political ends. It wasn’t terribly keen on these reports: it “ downplayed” the story put to it by the New York Times and told the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations.","Disinformation","This is one of those times when a chilling phenomenon – a targeted disinformation “war” – has its roots in the absurd. At the heart of this scandal lies an app called “thisisyourdigitallife”, which asked users to answer questions to build a pyschological profile. Facebook says its creator, an academic called Dr Aleksandr Kogan (who once went by the name Dr Spectre), “lied” to Facebook in 2014 by passing that data along to a company called SCL and its affiliate, Cambridge Analytica, without informing users. While some 270,000 people downloaded the app, the data of their friends on the platform was also collected (which was possible then, but not now). In total, some 50 million US-based profiles ended up in the data pool.","None of this should have happened. But when Facebook says its policies have been “violated”, it is not referring to the original data extraction, but its passing to a third party. The 270,000 users “gave their consent” to Kogan, it says, while their friends had “their privacy settings set to allow” their “more limited information” being accessed. Never mind that these tens of millions couldn’t have known who or what was behind an app that they had not downloaded themselves and most likely were not aware their “friends” had used.","Facebook executives who aren’t Mark Zuckerberg have been engaged in some weapons-grade splitting of hairs. Facebook doesn’t like the phrase “data breach”, you see. To call it a data breach is “completely false”, Grewal’s updated post states, because “people knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked”.","Violation","Okay. But the distinction Facebook draws between a violation and a data breach is hardly meaningful to its users, as vice-president Andrew Bosworth, appeared to concede later on Twitter. No trust, no sharing, no users.","Imploring Zuckerberg to come out to play at inquiries and hearings is itself a tactic, of course – calling on someone to “stop hiding” is a solid way to make them look secretive and undemocratic. (In Facebook’s case, this has not been hard.)","It also reminds the world just how much elected representatives are on the back foot when it comes to the unregulated power of the tech giants. They can be said to have kept themselves that way, too – the soft-touch provisions of the Data Protection Bill 2018, for example, do little to counteract the impression that Ireland is an outpost of Silicon Valley.","What is worse than a data breach? A tactical abdication of responsibility. It is all very well for Facebook to say it will “take legal action if necessary” against Kogan and his associates. The question now is, who will, or can, take legal action against Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

There wasn’t some technical security flaw that savvy hackers found and exploited.","People like to connect through Facebook, find info through Google, and buy products through Amazon. But none of that is going to stave off strong regulatory attempts by Congress. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration","Rather what happened was a misuse of data that was initially collected in a way Facebook encouraged through the Facebook Login tool for app developers. But that social graph data was, first, allegedly collected under false unclear pretenses (unlike the similar — if not more extensive — 2012 Obama reelection campaign Facebook data effort), and then, second, passed along to Cambridge Analytica. So a bad actor violated Facebook’s terms of service (which have since been modified). Moreover, it isn’t clear that the psychographic profiles of voters using the data are really that effective or had any meaningful impact on the 2016 presidential election. (I think there is a plausible case that the Trump campaign actually underperformed given the state of the economy and the quality of the opposing candidate.)","All of which . . . will provide a rather thin heat shield for Facebook — and Big Tech more broadly — in an environment of growing criticism that the megaplatforms are big, powerful, and out of control. I would be surprised if Mark Zuckerberg, in particular, won’t soon be heading to Washington to answer questions in front of a congressional committee or two. If 2017 was a reputational annus horribilis for Silicon Valley, 2018 is looking even worse. The sector’s reality distortion field is definitely on the fritz.","And you can’t just blame the bad actors, whether Cambridge Analytica or Russia’s Internet Research Agency. At the very least, Facebook seems to suffer from a lack of imagination about how its platforms can be misused. “The company routinely ignores or downplays the worst-case scenarios, idealistically building products without the necessary safeguards, and then drags its feet to admit the extent of the problems,” writes TechCrunch editor John Constine. And when crisis has hit, its public response has been lacking. Certainly Facebook and the industry need to take privacy more seriously, and be perceived as doing so. CNBC’s Matt Rosoff nails it: “Facebook is facing real problems. Instead of giving answers to those problems, top execs are selling, spinning and staying silent.”","People like to connect through Facebook, find info through Google, and buy products through Amazon. But none of that is going to stave off strong regulatory attempts by Congress. And that could include some fairly radical action such as, say, making tech firms more liable for the content on their platforms by significantly amending or even eliminating Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. And there might also be a growing push for antitrust action, even if the energy there is still more among activists than policymakers."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Removing your unpublished and deactivated pages where you are the only admin","So, you want to delete that page you created back in high school? That one that automatically got unpublished because you never posted anything on it? That one with 3 likes?","Yeah, sure, just wait 14 days, and then confirm again if you see the notification. Otherwise, Facebook will just assume you clicked 5 times to get to the delete button by accident.","2. Highlighting default button != enter button","Oh, you thought you could use the enter button to confirm the big blue highlighted button on popup dialogs like this? Yeah… no. Facebook decided to highlight the “X” button instead, so if you try to press enter to speed up deleting multiple things, it’ll just close the dialog for you instead.","3. Removing your self from tagged notes","That old note that your friend wrote and tagged you in it for everyone to see? Yeah, you cant remove your tag from there anymore. You’ll simple have to ask the friend to delete the whole note so it’ll get detached from your profile.","4. Deleting your developer apps","So, being a developer, I have quite a few apps on Facebook. Mostly dummy apps I used for testing, but still, I wanted to get rid of them too.","For security reasons, Facebook asks you to enter your password EVERY SINGLE TIME you try to delete an app.","Oh, and if you delete more than 10 apps in one a row, it’ll lock you out of your account for logging in too much with the correct password.","5. Removing your tags on photos","In order to remove yourself when you were tagged on photos you don’t own, you have to use the Activity Log feature. And there, you must select every single photo in order to remove the tags from them. There is no ‘Select All’ button, but there is a ‘Deselect All’ ;)","6. Refresh after every delete","To add cold water to the burned area, Facebook will almost always reload the page after deleting something. I know that from a developer point it’s easier to just reload the page in this case, but it makes deleting multiple things so much longer and frustrating.","If joining a group, uploading a photo or liking a post involved just a simple click, reversing that action should take the exact same amount of time and effort. Seems that Facebook doesn’t agree.","Edit (25/03/2018): After some searching online, I came across a very helpful Chrome extension called “Social Book Post Manager”.

Can we trust that mammoth corporations, with hundreds of thousands of employees, are all ethical and noble to the bone? That a jealous boyfriend won’t check up on his ex-girlfriend?

He said the approach pre-dated May's time as leader, but did not have further details immediately available.","The British government had three contracts in the past with SCL, it was revealed. The contracts were with the Ministry of Defence between 2014-2015, the Home Office (interior ministry) in 2009 and the Foreign Office in 2008-2009, the spokesperson told reporters, adding there are no current contracts.","Meanwhile, an academic who developed the app used by Cambridge Analytica to harvest data from millions of Facebook users said Wednesday he had no idea his work would be used in Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and that he's being scapegoated in the fallout from the affair.","Alexandr Kogan, a psychology researcher at Cambridge University, told the BBC that both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have tried to place the blame on him for violating the social media platform's terms of service, even though Cambridge Analytica ensured him that everything he did was legal.","\"My view is that I'm being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,\" he said. \"Honestly, we thought we were acting perfectly appropriately, we thought we were doing something that was really normal.\"","Authorities in Britain and the United States are investigating the alleged improper use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, a U.K.-based political research firm. Facebook shares have dropped some nine per cent, lopping more than $50 billion off the company's market value, since the revelations were first published, raising questions about whether social media sites are violating users' privacy.","The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, was suspended Tuesday after Britain's Channel 4 News broadcast hidden camera footage of him suggesting the company could use young women to catch opposition politicians in compromising positions. Footage also showed Nix bragging about the firm's pivotal role in the Trump campaign.","Nix said Cambridge Analytica handled \"all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting\" for the Trump campaign, and used emails with a \"self-destruct timer\" to make the firm's role more difficult to trace.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica's board said Nix's comments \"do not represent the values or operations of the firm, and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.\"","Facebook called lax","Facebook itself is drawing criticism from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic for its alleged failure to protect users' privacy.","Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who worked in data protection in 2011 and 2012, told a U.K. parliamentary committee Wednesday that the company was vigilant about its network security but lax when it came to protecting users' data.","He said personal data including email addresses and in some cases private messages was allowed to leave Facebook servers with no real controls on how the data was used after that.","\"The real challenge here is that Facebook was allowing developers to access the data of people who hadn't explicitly authorized that,\" he said, adding that the company had \"lost sight\" of what developers did with the data.","On Tuesday, the chairman of the U.K. Parliament's media committee, Damian Collins, said his group has repeatedly asked Facebook how it uses data, but company officials \"have been misleading to the committee.\"","The committee summoned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify. Facebook sidestepped questions on whether Zuckerberg would appear, saying instead that the company is currently focused on conducting its own reviews.","Leading Democrats in the U.S. Senate also called on Zuckerberg to testify. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called Facebook's latest privacy scandal a \"danger signal.\" She wants Zuckerberg's assurances that Facebook is prepared to take the lead on measures to protect user privacy — or Congress may step in.","Facebook and data company Cambridge Analytica are facing legal questions — in the U.K., a warrant has been ordered to search Cambridge Analytica's London headquarters, and on this side of the Atlantic, U.S. congressional staff are scheduled to be briefed by Facebook.

In collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, he developed a Facebook-based personality survey called \"This Is Your Digital Life\" and paid about 200,000 people to take part. As a result, participants unknowingly gave the researchers access to the profiles of their Facebook friends, allowing them to collect data from millions more users.","Kogan said Cambridge Analytica approached him to gather Facebook data and provided the legal advice that this was \"appropriate.\"","\"One of the great mistakes I did here was I just didn't ask enough questions,\" he said. \"I had never done a commercial project; I didn't really have any reason to doubt their sincerity. That's certainly something I strongly regret now.\"","He said the firm paid some $800,000 US for the work, but it went to participants in the survey.","\"My motivation was to get a dataset I could do research on; I have never profited from this in any way personally,\" he said.","Popular Now","Comments","To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Because Facebook has become habitual, because the trade-off seems relatively small. Because various tools and tech-enabled devices are now tracking every element of your day-to-day existence – even if you stopped using Facebook, you’d still be giving up your data on various other levels.","And while that last point is true, Facebook is still the keeper of the largest database of personal insights that has ever existed. Credit card companies know where you go, what you spend, what you buy. Supermarket loyalty schemes know your purchase habits, your travel patterns (in combination with fuel rewards). There are other ways to gather personal data, but Facebook, through its sheer scale, is much more than this.","It may not have been Facebook’s intention to become an all-encompassing people database, but it is, and that, as the broader discussion is now angling, comes with significant responsibility.","But what does this really mean for Facebook? Are we going to see users switch off, outraged by what’s gone on?","Is this the end for The Social Network?","In a word, no – here’s an overview of some of the flow-on impacts, and what they might mean for the company.","“Elon Quits Facebook”","As noted, with the latest Facebook scandal reaching fever pitch, many people have discussed getting off Facebook entirely, quitting cold turkey and refusing to give the company any more data. British band Massive Attack deleted their Facebook Page, the first high profile response to the news - but a bigger name taking the same action was Elon Musk, who deleted both the SpaceX and Tesla Facebook Pages, both of which had around 2.6 million followers each.","That’s bad news for The Social Network, right? Big name companies switching off Facebook entirely can’t be good. Yet in this case, it’s hard to see the move as anything more than symbolic.","In Massive Attack’s case, their decision is based on their values – the band has long advocated for various causes and political issues, so it’s not surprising to see them take a stance. In regards to Musk, he also noted that his companies don’t really utilize Facebook much anyway, so no major impact.","Musk’s stance highlights the reach and influence of Facebook, and the broader lack of awareness over just how far the platform’s tentacles now stretch. While a growing number of people have joined the #deletefacebook chorus, most are not saying the same about Instagram. Or WhatsApp. Or Messenger.","Indeed, various reports have indicated that users upset about Facebook’s conduct are switching to Instagram, with many of them not even aware that Facebook owns both platforms. If you’re not happy with Facebook tracking your data and logging your activity in order to use that information for ad targeting, you’re not making any statement by utilizing their various other apps.","That’s the real sting – while Facebook itself has more than 2 billion users, those other three apps now have more than 3.6 billion combined. The entire population of Earth is around 7.6 billion, which gives you some perspective on just how entwined Facebook is – and these apps aren’t even available in the most populous nation, and in many low connectivity regions.","It might seem like a logical, even necessary step to stop using Facebook, but cutting Zuck and Co. out of your life entirely will likely prove harder than you think.","And that’s before you consider the FOMO aspect – if you quit Facebook, you’ll be missing out on all the updates from your friends. Maybe, if you could convince all of them to leave, you might be okay, but that’s a tough ask. This is the same reason why it’s so difficult for newer social apps to break into the market, because in order for them to be valuable, you need to convince your entire friendship networks to come across.","The data that Cambridge Analytica, and many others, have accessed was from 2014, before Facebook moved to lock down more aspects of their data. As I noted this week, those insights are still valuable, and largely indicative of personality traits and habits, but that data has also already been recorded.","If you’ve used Facebook already, they already have all this, and there’s no real way for Facebook to get it all back. In his various interviews this week, Zuckerberg noted that they’ll be undertaking ‘forensic audits’ in any cases where they suspect their data may have been misused. Which is great, but it’s only being done in retrospect – and you can bet that of all those various apps and tools which took in Facebook data before the changes, at least some of the individuals involved are now looking through what they have, with a view to selling it to the highest bidder.","The data is already out there – you can stop Facebook taking more, definitely. But the benefits of doing so are debatable.","Data Usage","As explained in The Atlantic, millions of Facebook apps had been created before the company changed its data restrictions, which means that a heap of individuals and companies already have access to Facebook’s data.","Now, you might think that that information is from four years ago, it’s not valid now, but that would be incorrect. Due to the way in which you can use that information, it’s actually just as indicative now as it was then – and will remain so, likely forever.","The trick, as we noted in an earlier post, is in scale.","For example, if you had access to all of Facebook’s data points, you could go through and list all the likes of people who are members of, say, racist groups. You could then cross reference those likes and come out with a list of commonalities – people who like this group are also 95% likely to like ‘X’, ‘Y’ and ‘Z’.","Based on that insight, you could then take those commonalities and match them against all of the Facebook data you have. Now, even though those other members have not outright expressed support of the same group and or viewpoints, you know that there’s a very high likelihood that they’ll be susceptible to the same messaging.","Extrapolate that example to the trillions of data points you have access too through Facebook activity and you can imagine just how powerful – and accurate – those predictions could be. For instance, it wouldn’t ‘X’, ‘Y’ and ‘Z’ as your commonalities, you could match up hundreds, even thousands of data points.","Studies have also already linked Facebook activity to psychological leanings, so there’s already existing templates for such insight. Trends may change over time, but the underlying links between these data points will likely remain the same – you could take the profile of a person who joined Facebook last year and cross-reference it against these data points and you’d come up with an accurate profile of that person.","With so many users, and so much data, there’s truly no telling just how it could be manipulated to uncover relevant trends and leanings. And this already exists, it won’t matter if you shut down your Facebook profile now. You could do it in protest, as Massive Attack has done, but the impact will remain the same. Unless Facebook can find a way to get all of its data back, and delete all reference and record of it outside of the company, the problem will remain.","And there’s simply no way they’ll be able to achieve this.","Social Disaster","So what then - just sit back and accept your data is being used and abused, and be okay with it?","The attitude here might seem a little defeatist, but that’s the core of the issue – that Facebook can’t correct it. The company’s doing all it can, but as noted, that won’t be enough - it'll be possible, now and in future, for companies and individuals to use these insights to target their messaging and hone in on very specific audiences, and they may even be able to manipulate popular opinion based on such.","Even if Facebook eliminated ads on their platform, that still wouldn’t erase the problem, as you can use the same data for targeting in many other ways. And even if this never happened and no one else had access to these insights outside of Facebook, Facebook itself still would, along with much, much more.","Is that acceptable? Can we really trust a corporate entity with so much insight?","This is the real crux of the problem – it’s not that Cambridge Analytica or any other organization used Facebook data, it’s that so much data even exists in the first place. Take Facebook out of the equation and there’s still a heap of other sources you could refer to - we’re in an age where big data has become part of how we live, and that can also be used in negative ways. The broader debate here isn't even really about Facebook, it’s about the way in which data is stored and shared, and the ethics of such use.","Is there a way to police this? Can you even detect and enforce data usage rules? As noted, Facebook's doing all it can, but there’s really not a heap they can do. This is one of the core issues of our time - and it’s only likely to get worse (fitness trackers, smart assistants, etc.).","So how will this really impact Facebook? I’d say it won’t change a lot. People will be upset, regulators will examine the case, moves will be made. But at the end of the day, the platform has become such a huge part of everyday interaction that people will likely just continue on.","Does that mean you can be targeted by political ads designed to play to your leanings? Yes. Does that mean you should question everything? Yes."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-24"}

The “Facebook Container,” as the new extension is called, isolates your Facebook identity from the rest of the web. That means Facebook will not be able to use your other web activity to send your targeted advertising.","To be clear, this extension wouldn’t have saved users’ data from being compromised as it was in the Cambridge Analytica scandal; and it does nothing to prevent Facebook advertisers from diving into your profile and your activity while on the social network in order to target you with advertisements while browsing Facebook.","However, it is meant to plug at least one of the holes in Facebook’s leaky dam by offering a way for users to prevent Facebook from gaining even more data collected outside its service.","When you install the extension, it deletes your Facebook cookies and logs you out of the social network. The next time you open Facebook, you’ll notice it’s been opened in a blue-colored “container” tab.","From within that tab, you can continue to use Facebook normally. However, if you click a link that would take you to a page off of Facebook, it will load the URL outside the container. Similarly, if you click any Facebook Share buttons outside of Facebook, it will load those in the Facebook container. (But this will send information to Facebook about the website you shared them from, it should be noted.)","In addition, you may not be able to login to third-party apps with your Facebook credentials, and the embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons you see around the web won’t work either.","“This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity,” explains The Firefox Frontier blog. “So it may look different than what you are used to seeing.”","Actually, it may surprise you to find out how widespread your use of Facebook was when outside the social network.","Facebook’s platform and its off-site advertising network allow other sites and apps to access users’ Facebook data even when users aren’t on Facebook itself. Facebook is hardly alone in terms of companies doing this. But it is making headlines over data mishandling, which means it’s a good time for Mozilla to capitalize on consumers’ concerns to share their messages – and tools – focused on data privacy.","Mozilla said it sped up its work on the Facebook Container add-on, which is based on technology it’s been developing over the past couple of years, as it’s seen increasing consumer demand for tools for managing privacy and security.","There are other tools available to help consumers with these issues today, as well, including the Ghostery anti-tracking extension now owned by Cliqz, ad blockers (including those bundled with browsers like Safari), and more.","However, single-purpose tools like this are useful because they allow people to limit some data-sharing activity, without having to take the drastic step of deleting Facebook.","*DISCLAIMER - What sets us apart from other online business opportunities is our world class system and methods, as well as our integrity - so we want you to know exactly where you stand.

I have answers – Breaking News","text":["You had questions about your Facebook data. I have answers","I recently wrote about downloading 14 years of my Facebook data, where I uncovered a large collection of personal information about my life that the company has held onto over the years.","I fell down that rabbit hole on Friday, days after news broke that the data firm Cambridge Analytica misused information from 50 million Facebook users.","CNN readers had a lot of questions about my experience. Here they are, answered.","How do I download my data?","The tool you use to download a copy of your Facebook data isn’t very obvious at first.","You need to log onto Facebook and go to the “Settings” page. On desktop, click on the down arrow on the top corner of the screen.On the “General” section, select the option to “download a copy of your Facebook data.” I didn’t see the option on mobile; only on desktop.","Facebook will then email the data to you. It took about 10 minutes to download the folder, but it can take longer depending on the size of the file.","Inside, the data is segmented. The easiest way to view it is via the “html” folder.","My data didn’t include phone numbers for relatives who are not on Facebook — but you said the website collected your grandmother’s number. Why is that?","At some point, Facebook asked me to grant it access to my phone contacts. I did and forgot about it. Among those numbers was my late grandmother’s landline.","What I didn’t realize — and you may not have realized this, either — is that the Facebook-owned chat app Messenger continuously syncs phone contacts unless you proactively turn it off.","Here’s how you can turn it off: Tap your profile picture in the top left corner of your Messenger app. Then tap People and Sync Contacts. It will take you to your app settings, where you’ll need to toggle it off.","I also deleted my “invite history,” which includes the contacts that I allowed Messenger to upload from my phone. Anyone should be able to view their invite history data by clicking here.","It’s not clear whether following these steps completely removes my contacts from Facebook’s server. I’ve reached out to Facebook, but they have not yet responded.","Why is Facebook logging calls and texts?","Some Android users who reviewed their data noticed that Facebook had collected information about call history, including who they called and how long they spoke. Ars Technica reported the issue over the weekend.","On Sunday, Facebook published a blog post that said it only collects that data because users “expressly agreed” to share it when installing Messenger or Facebook Lite, an Android version of Facebook built for emerging markets that doesn’t require as much data or as strong an internet connection.","“This feature does not collect the content of your calls or text messages. Your information is securely stored and we do not sell this information to third parties,” the company wrote in the blog post. “You are always in control of the information you share with Facebook.”","Does Facebook know more about me than other platforms?","The short answer is not necessarily. Google, for example, collects location details, your search history and a lot more.","Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina, tweeted that it took her “about three tries to completely turn off Google location tracking.”","Tufekci researches technology, society, and privacy and surveillance. “If I can’t manage this, who is supposed to?” she asked.","It took me about three tries to completely turn off Google location tracking. I kept thinking I had turned it completely off, and it would just pop back up. If I can’t manage this, who is supposed to? I have a technical background and write/research about all this for a living.","If you didn’t go to Harvard University, how were you on Facebook in 2004?","First of all, I went to the University of Virginia. Thank you very much. Yes, Facebook started at Harvard University. But it rolled out the service to a number of other universities the same year, including my alma mater.","In 2005, Facebook opened up the platform to high schools.

Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to “fixing” Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.”","Meanwhile, Bloomberg has reported that the US Federal Trade Commission is to look at whether Facebook violated an agreement over its use of consumers’ personal data. The agreement was reached in 2011 following previous concerns about its handling of privacy issues.","In Ireland, the Data Protection Commissioner is “following up” with Facebook Ireland on issues relating to oversight of third parties who access its users’ data, following reports of alleged misuse of personal data by behavioural targeting firm Cambridge Analytica in the US.","In its first formal statement since reports at the weekend about the harvesting of the personal data of tens of millions of people in 2014, the commissioner said the issues reported by The Observer/The Guardian in relation to profiling of Facebook users affected substantially US Facebook users.","Britain is investigating whether Facebook did enough to protect data after a whistleblower said a London-based political consultancy hired by Donald Trump improperly accessed information on 50 million Facebook users to sway public opinion.","Elizabeth Denham, the head of Britain’s Information Commission, is seeking a warrant to search the offices of Cambridge Analytica after a whistleblower revealed it had harvested the private information of millions of people to support Trump’s 2016 US presidential campaign.","In a statement on Tuesday Ireland’s data commissioner said: “The issue of “friends” data being harvested when a Facebook user engaged with an app on Facebook was resolved by Facebook in May 2014 when access to friends’ data was restricted by a platform upgrade.”","Friends’ data","“This followed a 2012 recommendation by DPC Ireland on foot of its re-audit of Facebook Ireland in relation to access to friends’ data.”","The commissioner said the issue of purported misuse of data by the companies; Strategic Communication Laboratories, GSR and Cambridge Analytica was incorporated into the UK Information Commissioner’s current investigation of political influencing.","“The Irish DPC is following up with Facebook Ireland in relation to what forms of active oversight of app developers and third parties that utilise their platform is in place with a view to ensuring it is effective,” the commissioner’s office said.","“The micro-targeting of social media users with political advertisements and sponsored stories remains an ongoing issue today.","“In the absence of laws specifically regulating such political targeting online, the Irish DPC intends to issue guidance to users in terms of how they can trace why they are receiving certain advertisements and stories on social media, how they can mute or turn off receiving advertisements from those sources and how they can amend their ad preferences to control the types of ads they are served.”","The Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland is effectively the regulator for Facebook’s operations in Europe.","The controversy has hit Facebook shares which closed down nearly 7 per cent on Monday, wiping nearly $40 billion off its market value as investors worried that damage to the reputation of the world’s largest social media network would deter users and advertisers.","Washington","In Washington, the Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee sent a letter on Monday to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg requesting information and a briefing on the Facebook user data.","Under a 2011 settlement, Facebook agreed to get user consent for certain changes to privacy settings as part of a settlement of federal charges that it deceived consumers and forced them to share more personal information than they intended.","That complaint arose after the company changed some user settings without notifying its customers, according to an FTC statement at the time.","An FTC spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.","Targeted advertising","Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.","Facebook has said the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also their friends’.","Facebook said Mr Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.","Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed.","Mr Kogan says he changed the terms and conditions of his personality-test app on Facebook from academic to commercial part way through the project, according to an email to Cambridge University colleagues obtained and cited by CNN.","Mr Kogan says Facebook made no objection, but Facebook says it was not informed of the change, CNN reported.","Mr Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.","The Channel 4 News investigation, broadcast on Monday, comes two days after the Observer reported Cambridge Analytica had gained unauthorised access to tens of millions of Facebook profiles in one of the social media company’s biggest data breaches.","Deep digging","On Monday, Mr Nix said the media attacks were because of his firm’s role in the successful presidential election campaign of Donald Trump.","Mr Nix, one of the CA executives targeted by the undercover Channel 4 reporters, suggested he could use women to entrap politicians on behalf of their rivals.","“Deep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true, and make sure that that’s video recorded.","“You know, these sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things,” he was recorded saying.","Mr Nix said they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house”, adding that Ukrainian girls “are very beautiful, I find that works very well”, Channel 4 reported.","Mr Nix told BBC’s Newsnight the sting was “a co-ordinated attack by the media that’s been going on for very, very many months”.","He added, however, that he had a “huge amount of regrets about the fact that we, maybe, undertook this meeting and spoke with a certain amount of hyperbole about some of the things that we do”. - Additional reporting PA/Guardian/ Bloomberg"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The share plunge erased $5billion from the net worth of Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg as calls for investigations came on both sides of the Atlantic after Facebook responded to the explosive reports of misuse of its data by suspending the account of Cambridge Analytica, a British firm hired by Trump’s 2016 campaign.","Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy called for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to appear before Congress, along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter.

{"originalurl":"https://techindc.com/2018/03/27/media-facebook-data-gathering","title":"The Guardian and The New York Times are part of Facebook's data gathering mechanism","text":["Facebook Pixel is a piece of code that any Facebook business page can create on the Facebook platform before placing it in almost any website, to track user behaviour whilst also reporting information from your social media, if the user is concurrently logged into Facebook. Facebook’s Business page, that discloses how the platform’s relationship with business accounts work, states “we’ll compare your data with ours to help you find the people you know on Facebook”, and in a separate section “customer audiences from your website is a targeting option which match people who visit your website with people on Facebook using the Facebook Pixel”.","While it’s not possible to individually target ads, a comment from a Facebook employee on their FAQ states, ”if you used the Facebook Pixel to create a Custom Audience out of your website visitors, we’d only be able to collect traffic into that audience that we can match back to a Facebook profile. Additionally, if you were to create a Website Conversions campaign, we’d only be able to capture conversions that happened as a result of traffic exclusively from Facebook profiles”. With the data routed to Facebook servers, the whole social media profile of a person is incrementally improved with the websites they visit and their behaviour on those sites.","In a Reply All episode called “Is Facebook Spying on you?” that aired in November last year, the presenters addressed the theory that Facebook was tapping into user’s microphones and listening for advertising purposes. Though the show fails to convince any of the interviewed users that Facebook wasn’t doing that, it made a pertinent point about Facebook Pixel that applies here:","“It watches what you do and reports it back to Facebook. It can see how long you linger on a certain webpage, it can see if you purchase something, it can see if you put something in your cart on a website and decide not to buy it, it’s kind of, like, an internet surveillance camera.” – Alex Goldman","Facebook Pixel gathers data through cookies, which store information about your session on your browser and can identify a user across many sites, it is the pixel, however, that is the trigger which makes the data-grab happen. Through the digital tag, the media giants alongside all third party websites that use the Facebook Pixel code, can collect information about a user and what their areas of interest are, before channelling tailored messages and adverts throughout a Facebook profile. The issue here is that as a result of the Facebook Pixel being back-end code, users will not necessarily be aware that any data is being collected on them or, for that matter, how much data.","EU Cookie Law requires websites in European Union countries to inform users that cookies are being used, but this is not applicable to the wider world audience meaning the data collection occurs without any prompts or authorisation across the United States. Furthermore, there is no notice given that the data gathered on the site is being linked to your social media profile. The cookie notice states:","“[cookies] can also be used to keep track of the pages visited using your browser, which gives site owners important insights into the quality of their services, enabling them to improve and better meet the needs of all their visitors. This information can sometimes be used to present advertising and other messages relevant to your browsing history.”","The story comes shortly after The Guardian, The Observer, Wired and Recode held Facebook to account for Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting, the UK firm which was caught storing Facebook data which users did not know had been collected. Our reporting found no evidence that cookie data was included in the Cambridge Analytica data.","As well as picking up how site visitors navigate, Facebook Pixel is also the tool that allows advertising across various websites. It is the mechanism that will place items that were previously searched on eBay, for instance, into the adverts on the Facebook sidelines. Although there is an awareness of this connection, most often don’t think twice about how, or why or more importantly where exactly that information is going especially with so many daily adverts are directed at us online. It is the piece of code which allows behaviour on one site to influence advertisements on another, the reason advertisements seem to follow you around the internet.","Of Facebook’s own pixel version, the entire process is advertised as a seamless, risk-free and easy way to optimise website users, and displays the ability to “remarket to everyone who visits your site, or just to people who visit specific pages or take specific actions”. Facebook also gives potential marketers the option to “create a lookalike audience” which will collate a selection of Facebook users who have similar tendencies to the users who have previously accessed their website, and allow them to market to you. The pixel itself, accessible only to Facebook Ads users sits on top of the entire ad account, meaning that one code is then powerful enough to track all the adverts sent out.","“You can pass the customer identifiers, such as email, phone number that you collect from your website during the checkout, account sign-in, or registration process as parameters in the pixel. Facebook then uses this information to match pixel events with Facebook users when the Facebook cookie is not present on the browser that fires the pixel”.","The cookie policy for The Guardian, The Observer, The New York Times, Wired (Conde Nast) and Recode (Vox Media) all describe the kind of data that is collected and the kind of advertising it may be used for. All state that they may pass this information on to third parties and are not responsible for the usages policies of those third parties. Vox Media and Conde Nast are much clearer on passing your data on to third parties which may use it for targeted advertising.","This comes after a long line of revelations that expose Facebook’s underlying code as collecting data and website trends. What we do know is that the mechanism pools personal information alongside knowledge about a user’s interests, ranging from which news stories they read to where they do their online groceries (Walmart uses Facebook Pixel as well as Buzzfeed, Pintrest and Paypal). With few online sources detailing how this mechanism works, or the extent of which this uses data from Facebook friends, it remains a relatively unregulated access point to personal details.","Using marketing tags like this is practised among a range of providers including Google. The marketing message is simple: the wider the range of sites which use Facebook Pixel the more comprehensive their understanding of a given user. There are now easy ways to view what websites are using tags, for instance adding ‘Tag Explorer’ to your Google Chrome extension will allow the programme to count and detail how many tags are used on each page you visit. Through such an extension, of which there are many, it was easy to see that Ebay has 16 codes embedded into its page, Facebook Pixel being one of them. When turning attention to prominent media outlets, The Guardian has eleven, technology publication Recode has 18, Wired has 27 and The New York Times comes out on top with 41. All four of these news companies use Facebook Pixel to track which readers to advertise to. The national media companies then use this data to advertise subscriptions but the adverts themselves will also vary depending on how interactive the user was on their original website.","Furthermore the question of whether this tool can be abused by third parties, to the extent of Cambridge Analytica was alluded to in an article published this morning on Bloomberg. The study documents the seedy underside of Facebook adverts and draws focus to how easy it is for scammers to create bogus tracking software and place fake ads within the Facebook platform. The article details then how easy it is for affiliates looking to promote fake adverts can avoid the few restrictions in place and essentially make profit from Facebook fads. With the knowledge that all of these users can also access Facebook Pixels, this highlights the underlying issue that third parties have the potential to utilise this free access to data and the users connected to it.","Until recently it appeared that this mechanism is impossible to turn off, however amidst fears of data privacy, search engine Mozilla Firefox will be introducing the ‘Facebook Container‘ to limit the platforms access to data grabbing and deleting your Facebook cookies. However such steps don’t appear to be enough to prevent the external links to your Facebook account, meaning Facebook Pixel can track the device you use on your laptop and tablet to your phone. Although websites sometimes ask for an authorisation regarding the use of Cookies, there is in reality little information about the legalities of Facebook Pixel, where the data is exactly stored, how much of that has been given to other parties and whether that data can be copied onto third-party servers.","A disclosure on Facebook details the platform “typically deletes all matched and unmatched hashes within 48 hours after the matching process ends, unless we need to retain any data for troubleshooting or product improvement.” However in Zuckerberg’s recent Recode interview, he acknowledges that “There’s this values tension playing out between the value of data portability, right? Being able to take your data and some social data … To be able to create new experiences on the one hand, and privacy on the other hand, and just making sure that everything is as locked down as possible”. And CookieLaw.org states, “cookies are used by most websites in many different ways, including… personalis[ing] your web experience.","Facebook makes no attempt to hide information about the Facebook Pixel, but it does require you to know what you are looking for. Following on from this, revelations in recent days which reveal that Facebook has saved the call and message history of some Android users requires Google to take a certain amount of responsibility. And more recently Amazon have been drawn into the situation too. With all the platforms and media websites tied into the mix, it is clear that rather than pointing fingers or deleting Facebook, there is, in fact, a much larger issue regarding the general way we, as users, approach our data. We must wonder if it’s too late to untangle our online, interconnected, presence.","We reached out to all of the media outlets mentioned for comment on when they started using Facebook Pixel, what data they take and their relationships with Facebook. We haven’t received responses yet but will update this article as and when we do."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

It's clear these platforms can't police themselves,\" she said on Twitter. \"I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say 'trust us.'

I guess that's all they have left,\" Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about tech companies' use of data, told Reuters. \"The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook's data practices and the picture is not pretty.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

If Facebook isn’t just a surveillance experiment, it’s also one of the biggest misuses of the power of the web we’ve ever witnessed.","What if digital advertising was actually toxic? In 2017 and 2018 we’re witnessing how big Tech is unable to protect users from inappropriate content. The latest stories show how dark a dystopia the Ad-based web has become. Users of Facebook all over the world, are getting fed up.","Upset Users Create #Deletefacebook Campaign","Users all over the world are now calling out for a #deletefacebook campaign, as the Ad-based internet keeps on taking more sinister revelations as what Facebook sought to suppress (it’s known about this for 2+ years), is getting aired by the Guardian, NY Times and now basically, everyone.","Mark Zuckerberg cares a lot about his image, I mean a lot! Yet just after cashing about nearly $1 Billion in stocks, that Facebook gives away your data is now common knowledge, circa March 2018, there is a crisis of leadership now at Facebook.","Facebook Stock Plummets","Facebook stock plunged nearly 7% yesterday, as the Cambridge Analytics story is breaking multiple spin-off stories. The cases bring to light a lot of illegal activities and the lack of audits on how third party developers were using Facebook’s data on its users.","It doesn’t matter how many users your platform has collected, if you do not respect the privacy and basic rights of your users. Facebook early on decided to place profits ahead of people, and while it was common knowledge, just how irresponsible it has been is only now coming to our full view.","The Failure of Leadership in Big Tech","Investors are starting to get worried, as Facebook’s CEO has been silent on the issue. Since Facebook’s role in the 2016 elections, there’s been widespread decline of engagement on the platform, yet this breaking story is sure to accelerate the process of users leaving the social media network so ubiquitous, some say it’s a kind of public utility like Google search has become for web citizens around the world.","What happens when that public utility is basically a hacker’s paradise where data harvesting and privacy breaches, are the norm, rather than the exception to the rule? What sort of legal ramifications does it have? Where is the social conscience of digital advertizers like Facebook and Google? Has technology overtaken our ethics?","Facebook is smart, it takes no responsibility for being either a media company or a Big Data privacy keeper. It takes the very approach you’d expect kids from highschool to take on our user data and privacy rights. You don’t drop out of college to become a moral leader of our times, so it seems for Mr. Zuckerberg.","As more executives have come forward in 2017 and in recent months, it’s clear Facebook has been a weapon more than a tool of late on the web, as its cybersecurity and lack of regulation means we’re all vulnerable for participating. Our opinions can be hacked, our social infrastructures harvested and the very fabric of how our smartphone addiction is monetized sets a dangerous precedent in place.","Facebook isn’t Really Necessary","Facebook became something like a black market for data where data harvesting was weaponized for national interests that hurt Americans. The United States already is experiencing the worst crisis of trust that has been escalating for decades. If this isn’t the culmination of mistrust, I do not know what is.","Facebook as a company certainly must stick true to its values, it cannot unfriend itself, only users can choose to stop using such a service. However, Facebook became so popular, the lie was in the profits, Facebook is not essential to our life in the way that Amazon is. There are plenty of other ways to connect with family and friends in apps, or read the news.","Facebook isn’t like Tencent’s WeChat, the most useful app on the planet (that even has mini-programs). Facebook is a symbol of how the web was turned against itself and turned against humanity via the advent of the Ad-centric model. Facebook was not just responsible for political and social turmoil, but for stunting innovation itself as monopolies of Big Tech grew out of the early enthusiasm for the web. Fast forward to 2018, most of the top talent is poached by the likes of Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple and others. Yet is this hoard of talented professionals, making the world a better place?","Technology’s Failure to Self-Regulate","Facebook may be too big and too valuable to the U.S. government to be taken down. The BigData is too rich. The ability to influence Americans too easy. Facebook’s stock price is only down to $164, it may amount to $Billions of a drop in market cap, in the world of tech stocks that’s just a little slip this week.","Mark Zuckerberg may only be 5 feet 7 inches, but his dealings as a major Tech leader puts all of Silicon Valley in jeopardy. If Americans don’t trust Big Tech, it won’t just impact Facebook, but other companies as well. It will create more mistrust in an era where American lack of trust in institutions is at an all-time high where social anarchy is increasing and Facebook has a rather large place in how this is occuring. You can talk about the dangers of not regulating AI and biotechnology, but if simple algorithms can do this to society, what will more dangerous technologies be able to do?","Facebook very carefully chose not to care about being a media company or protecting our data, for profit and to please shareholders and win over Wall Street. But in doing so, Facebook abandoned users and their basic human rights.","We live in a world where data and trust are bought these days. For Facebook recently, what’s the cost of being caught?

The EU is taking the turn from U.S. which has already opened an investigation to find out how Facebook permitted data breach of 50 million users.","Facebook has been experiencing fierceful attacks both by the regulators and the market. The multinational company officials have to explain how a political consultancy managed to build voter profiles on behalf of Donald Trump’s campaign by using Facebook data the moment that the U.S. firm already loses more than 70 billions of dollars.","EC expresses data privacy concerns","The executive body of the EU mobilised two days ago when the EU justice Commissioner Vera Jourova sent to Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg a letter requesting for further details on the scandal. More specifically, Vera Jourova asked: “Have any data of EU citizens been affected by the recent scandal? If this is the case, how do you intend to inform the authorities and users about it?” Furthermore, the Commissioner wrote to Sheryl Sandberg to verify whether similar situations currently exist. Ms Jourova expects to receive an answer from Facebook’s COO within the next two weeks.","However, the answer, if any, is most likely going to be unsatisfying even if a Facebook spokeswoman said that it is going to take that chance to brief the Commission on the issue responding to the questions. The latter can be retrieved by the stance that the company is so far holding. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has already declined the invitations by British lawmakers who are asking him to explain how this data privacy breach happened.","EU citizen data exposed?","Germany justice minister Katarina Barley met with Facebook executives who verified her that about 1% out of the 300.000 users whose data are likely exposed came from Europe. The German minister underlined that promises of tougher controls by the giant social media company are not sufficient. More in detail, Katarina Barley mentioned last Monday: “Facebook admitted abuses and excesses in the past and gave assurances that measures since taken mean they can’t happen again. But promises aren’t enough. In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly.”","U.S. against Facebook","At the other side of the Atlantic, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opened an investigation last Monday about the privacy practices of Facebook and in particular the Cambridge Analytica scandal where the consultancy gathered data from 50 million Facebook users to be used to influence votes in the Brexit referendum and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Moreover, the U.S. consumer protection regulator and attorneys representing 37 U.S. states requested clear explanations on the case.","Facebook founder has also been invited by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee to testify at an April 10 hearing. As if this wasn’t enough, U.S. Senate Commerce Committee formally asked Mark Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing. U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, commented on the issue that: “Facebook’s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards”.","Market losses","The U.S. giant firm has been experiencing consequential losses as its share has dropped almost by 18% since March 16 when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook share has reached levels of July 2017 when its value was around 150$. As it seems, investors are highly affected by the recent scandal. How long is it going to last? Investors are most likely going to exploit this stock price drop and buy more basing their decision on the long-term growth prospects of the company.","Advertisers and users dissatisfaction","Apart from the billions of dollars that Facebook has already lost, the image of the company has also been affected. Several advertisers have been removing their Facebook ads. Wireless speaker maker Sonos stated that will remove advertising from Facebook while retailer Pep Boys, Mozilla Corp and bank Commerzbank AG suspended all advertising. Elon Musk deleted Facebook pages both for SpaceX and Tesla. What is more, opinion poll by Reuters/Ipsos which was released on Sunday showed that less than half of the Americans believe that Facebook follows U.S. privacy laws.","All in all, the Cambridge Analytica scandal is costing a lot to Facebook which will be pressured by the U.S. and EU regulators to alter its data privacy rules and provide more rigid protection to its users. It remains to be seen which other data privacy cases are going to be unveiled in the near future, the fines to be imposed and the measures to be taken in order to prevent similar data privacy violations.","Faces of the Week","British Premier Theresa May received Donald Trump, President of the United States, at Chequers, the country house of the Prime Minister of UK.

{"originalurl":"https://thenewinquiry.com/privacy-for-whom/","title":"Privacy for Whom? – The New Inquiry","text":["Privacy for Whom?","Two new books show that for the poor, privacy has never been on offer","In\nthe liberal imagination, government surveillance threatens everyone: a watchful eye hovering over an undifferentiated public. Privacy, in turn, is that which safeguards our individuality, defining the spaces in which the citizen cannot be governed. “Privacy is the right to a self,” Edward Snowden said in 2016. “Privacy is what gives you the ability to share with the world who you are on your own terms.” For Snowden, privacy is the “fountainhead” of all rights. Without a “quiet space, a space within yourself” beyond the reach of the state, free and democratic engagement is impossible.","There is utility in this discourse. It broadens the potential constituency for reform. But it also obscures the topography of power, eliding the sorts of privacy invasions that are regularly experienced by the poor, the brown, the marginal. For the underclasses, privacy—in the form of access to ungovernable spaces—has never been on offer.","This reality is transparent in the case of policing. The Fourth Amendment—which protects against unwarranted search and seizure—is spatially defined. Individuals have a “reasonable expectation of privacy” from the eyes and ears (and noses) of the state in places where they can reasonably expect not to be overheard or observed by others. You have the most privacy in your home, somewhat less in your car, and hardly any on a public street. Thus, those who can afford more private space will inevitably have more privacy. People who live in densely packed neighborhoods and thin-walled apartment complexes, who have little “curtilage” surrounding their homes, who live their private lives in public spaces, have considerably less. The homeless—who, by necessity, live in public space and have tenuous property claims to their makeshift dwellings—have barely any Fourth Amendment rights at all. Like many of liberalism’s guarantees, privacy is not a universal right but a class right: guaranteed to those who can buy it.","When a middle-class white person imagines a privacy violation, they tend to think of an embarrassing disclosure of personal information: their sexts posted online, their email address leaked in the Ashley Madison hack. Some may imagine the “creepy-crawly” feeling of being watched. Indiana University School of Law professor James P. Nehf has written, reflecting the perception of many scholars, “Privacy is seldom a matter of life and death.” But for the poor and marginal, invasions of privacy are often lethal matters. A stop-and-frisk can easily end in a police shooting. Data shared from a registry can lead to arrests or deportation. Scrutiny from a caseworker can tear a family apart.","In the past few years, a wave of new scholarship has emerged that underscores the inadequacy of universalist privacy discourse. In order to protect against the tangible harms of surveillance, these scholars say, civil libertarians must attend to the particular.","While many liberal privacy advocates warn that a dystopian society is around the corner—unless, say, proper limits are placed on law-enforcement access to cell-phone data or communications collected by the National Security Agency—these new scholars argue that a huge portion of the American public already lives in a privacy-free rights environment. Through their close attention to social history, a new picture of privacy emerges: less like a universal right than like a privilege of whiteness and wealth. The laws that protect some from the scrutiny of the state have never protected those whom the state seeks to confine and control. For the poor and marginal, the nightmare scenario is already here.","From\nthe plantation to the penitentiary, surveillance and punishment originated in America as projects of social control. The slave system was enabled by a trio of information technologies—the slave pass, the fugitive slave poster, and the slave patrol—which together enabled the planter class to exert dictatorial rule, projecting their power throughout the antebellum South.","Plantation ledger books served as proto-biometric databases, recording not only financial records but the physical characteristics of enslaved persons’ bodies, their labor and reproductive capacities. Plantation architecture facilitated intervisibility between the overseer and the slave, from the verandas of the big house to the slave quarters and fields. These interlocking systems—enabled by sight, terror, and violence—were designed to disrupt solidarity among enslaved peoples, prevent runaways, and, most of all, deter and quell rebellion.","In northern cities, regulation of vice fell not to the courts but to constables, night watchmen, and jailors, who were given wide latitude in their choice of punishment. They paid special attention to unruly working-class women—those, as Jen Manion documents in her excellent 2015 history Liberty’s Prisoners: Carceral Culture in Early America, who were “too poor, too loud, too sexual, too drunk, or too independent.” Anyone who posed a perceived threat to the white heterosexual family, or its gendered division of labor, attracted the attention of the authorities. By 1807, Manion writes, the poor were just as likely to be held for what they did not have, a job or a home, as for how they behaved. Poverty itself was the crime.","Virginia Eubanks’s new book, Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor, which came out in January, extends this historical trajectory into the 21st century. Despite the successes of abolitionist, labor, civil rights, and feminist movements, America’s prisons are still warehouses for the poor, the police state is still mainly a means of regulating the lower orders, and the watchful eye of the modern-day constable is still trained primarily on the poor, the brown, the defiant, and the marginal. Eubanks, an associate professor of political science at the University at Albany, SUNY, has spent her career illuminating how our systems of provision and punishment collude to control and survey the poor, who are presumed to be dangerous social deviants.","Automating Inequality explores how the brick-and-mortar poorhouse of the 19th century has been replaced by the “digital poorhouse” of today. In the contemporary welfare system, poor people’s worthiness for benefits and their propensity for criminality are assessed by data-mining computer algorithms, which, contrary to the hopes of their proponents, tend to recreate and exacerbate inequality. Eubanks explores three experiments in which algorithms are replacing or augmenting human decision-making —Indiana’s automated Medicaid eligibility process, Los Angeles’s coordinated entry system for the homeless, and Allegheny County of Pennsylvania’s predictive algorithm for assessing childhood risk of abuse and neglect.","With the exception of the Indiana program—part of a statewide privatization effort led by Republican Governor Mitch Daniels, who would probably means-test trick-or-treaters if he could—the systems Eubanks encounters were at least devised with the welfare of the vulnerable in mind. LA’s registry, “touted as the Match.com of homeless services,” was supposed to distribute housing resources to the neediest with an efficiency and precision that a lurching municipal bureaucracy could never achieve. The Allegheny Family Screening Tool (AFST), launched in August 2016, was designed to eliminate the human bias that leads caseworkers to overreport nonwhite families as maltreatment risks—and overlook the signs of abuse elsewhere.","In practice, however, automated systems rely on the collection of ever more intimate details about the lives of welfare beneficiaries, cataloguing, classifying, and ranking “their traumas, coping mechanisms, feelings, and fears.” From the moment they apply, welfare applicants find themselves ensnared in a web of surveillance, subject to persistent scrutiny, a presumption of guilt, invasive interrogations, coercion of their reproductive choices, and violations of their bodily and decisional autonomy. In the supposed interest of preventing fraud, saving taxpayer dollars, and protecting children, the state forces poor families to bare themselves, interrogating every purchase, every parenting decision, every relationship.","Automation undermines due process and fails to address the underlying causes of poverty. These systems collect and produce data that justify the status quo and criminalize desperation. The Allegheny algorithm treats the use of public services itself as a risk to children. “A quarter of the predictive variables in the AFST,” Eubanks reports, “are direct measures of poverty: they track use of means-tested programs such as TANF, SSI, SNAP, and county medical assistance.” That means that poor families are at a higher risk of being investigated for neglect and abuse if they take advantage of the services available to care for their children.","The homeless in LA face a comparable devil’s choice. In order to access housing resources, homeless men and women in LA must fill out a “vulnerability index” entry survey. The survey solicits an array of personal information: social security number, full name, birth date, demographic information, veteran status, immigration and residency status, and where the respondent can be found at various times of day. It also asks intimate questions about the applicants’ experiences with domestic violence, sexual assault, self harm, drug abuse, sex work, and mental health. Admitting “risky, or even illegal, behavior” on the entry survey, Eubanks found, can “snag you a higher ranking on the priority list for permanent supportive housing.” But it also makes you more vulnerable to the police. The self-reported data in the LA registry is made available to the LAPD without a warrant, departmental oversight, or judicial review of any kind.","Most of all, Eubanks demonstrates, increased digital scrutiny and automation further isolate the poor from the affluent, undermining the intimate interactions that facilitate empathy—or, better yet, solidarity. “Like earlier technological innovations in poverty management,” Eubanks writes, “digital tracking and automated decision-making hide poverty from the middle-class public and give the nation the ethical distance it needs to make inhuman choices.” It’s easier, after all, for a caseworker to change a zero to a one than to face, in person, the parents of 6-year-old Sophie Stipes, a severely disabled child whose Medicaid benefits were cancelled by Indiana’s automated system. The digital poorhouse reframes questions of justice as questions of efficiency. Algorithms score individuals, deciding how to distribute scarce resources, but in so doing they reify scarcity. “Homelessness is not a systems engineering problem,” UCLA law professor Gary Blasi told Eubanks. “It’s a carpentry problem.” As with the county poorhouses of yore, Eubanks writes, automation is a means of managing the poor, “so that we do not have to eradicate poverty.”","Eubanks’s\nbook is a rejoinder to the bloodless numericalization of social problems that typifies the neoliberal approach to welfare. Automating Inequality is filled with tender, humane stories about people on both sides of public provision. Gary Boatwright, a 64-year-old homeless man affectionately known as “Commander Kush” by his neighbors, offers Eubanks his bottle of water—a precious commodity on Skid Row—when she comes to visit his tent. Patrick Grzyb and Angel Shepherd, disabled and unemployed, live with Angel’s 9-year-old daughter Harriette and Patrick’s six-year-old granddaughter Deseraye. When the girls bicker, Patrick has each of them don a sleeve of the “Get-Along-Shirt,” one of Patrick’s “roomy button-downs,” until they stop fighting. The mixed, intergenerational family has faced a series of neglect investigations by the Allegheny Office of Children, Youth, and Families (CYF). Pat Gordon, a CYF caseworker, Eubanks writes, “is the kind of woman who keeps pictures of other people’s children in her cubicle. . . . Her mischievous laugh quickly transitions to quiet seriousness” when she discusses the kids she serves.","Typically, Eubanks observes, stories about the poor only have two lessons, either “‘You should feel sorry for the poor’ or ‘You shouldn’t.’” With these complex, intimate portraits, Eubanks seeks to break the ideological injunction that our narratives of poverty orbit around worthiness. Paraphrasing the journalist Monica Potts, Eubanks observes, when it comes to depictions of the hard up, Americans tend only to tolerate “illustrations of suffering, litanies of misery, or morality plays of bad choices and their consequences.” But human beings aren’t object lessons for the middle class.","For Eubanks, defeating the moral mythology of poverty, which has persisted in America since the founding, is pivotal to rectifying the wrongs of the digital poorhouse. The notion that poverty is primarily a consequences of moral lack sooths the consciences of the middle class, underlies the assumption that poor people are bad parents, and justifies a system of permanent totalitarian surveillance in their lives.","Eubanks\nis but one of a number of scholars who reject these mainstream premises about privacy and surveillance. Indeed, as she and others show, the legal regime of privacy was never intended to protect them in the first place.","In her 2016 book The Poverty of Privacy Rights, Boston University legal scholar Khiara Bridges documents how women on welfare are denied spatial, decisional, and informational privacy in nearly every aspect of their lives. They are subject to invasive, sometimes retraumatizing, questioning as a prerequisite for attaining benefits. Through restrictions on funding elective abortion and family-cap policies for mothers on welfare, the state intrudes upon the most intimate decisions of their lives: variously forcing women to give birth and to terminate pregnancies against their wills. Courts have consistently upheld warrantless searches of welfare recipients’ homes—supposedly the most sacred place in Fourth Amendment doctrine—to search for evidence of fraud. The courts reason that welfare applicants have an “uncoerced” choice to refuse a home visit, because there is no penalty for refusing to consent—other than the denial of benefits. But of course, it betrays a profound indifference to the lived experience of poor people to suggest that the threat of losing benefits is not coercion. As legal scholar Chris Slobogin has noted, those suspected of tax fraud—a crime whose cost to the American taxpayer is incomparably more severe—enjoy the full protection of the Fourth Amendment, while those suspected of welfare fraud receive none.","The government’s justification for its punitive and intrusive approach to welfare is its interest in protecting poor children and reducing fraud. But our government also declines to do the very thing we know would contribute most to poor children’s safety and health: make their families less poor. One in five American children lives in poverty; American children are ranked 26th among rich countries in terms of “overall well-being”; and we spend among the least on benefits and services to families. America’s stingy approach to public benefits contradicts our supposedly dogged commitment to safeguarding poor children. Instead, our punitive welfare state seeks to “correct” the bad behavior of poor mothers—whose moral flaws are presumed to account for their poverty—while declining to provide for their needy children.","The best way to eliminate the more punitive, suspicious, and stigmatizing aspects of the welfare system would be to abandon means-tested benefits altogether. In its place, we could have a universal basic income or system of universal child allowances. A universal benefit alleviates the need for persistent state scrutiny and intrusive data collection—because everyone gets it regardless of need. Universal benefits (like social security and Medicare) also help to diminish the stigmatizing and isolating aspects of means-testing. It’s harder to scapegoat and demonize poor black mothers—a persistent theme in anti-welfare rhetoric—when every American family is receiving cash benefits.","We would do well to abandon the popular understanding of the privacy-rights bearer as an affluent white man—unburdened by history, by power, by coercion. He bears almost no resemblance to those who endure the worst consequences of surveillance. The embrace of such a figure by civil-liberties groups routinely limits our ability to imagine the privacy harms experienced by nonwhite, nonmale, and nonrich people. The right “to be let alone,” as Brandeis and Warren explained in their 1890 articulation of legal privacy, is of little use to those whose economic circumstances necessitate a life of interdependence. The common law principle that a “home is man’s castle,” is worthless if you don’t have a home.","Those of us who believe in privacy as a fundamental right—a guarantee of human dignity, autonomy, and self-determination—should also advocate for policies to correct the massive inequalities in wealth and power that make the equitable enjoyment of privacy impossible."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The meeting was first reported by The Verge.","An undercover TV report Monday suggesting that Cambridge Analytica was prepared to consider using bribes and entrapment to create videos for clients it could then post to the internet to sway voters is piling on the pressure.","Cambridge Analytica says it does not engage in bribery or entrapment and says the Channel 4 News report was a misrepresentation of how the company conducts its business.","Facebook says the user data in question was initially properly gathered by a psychology professor, who then passed it to Cambridge Analytica. That breached Facebook's rules.","Cambridge Analytica says it deleted all the data in 2015 when it learned that Facebook rules had been broken.

They fell again in early trade on Tuesday, dropping 3%.","\"What matters for this stock, at this time, are the headlines,\" wrote analysts at Macquarie Capital.","But the questions of data privacy thrown up by the scandal strike at the heart of Facebook's business, which relies on more than 1.4 billion users engaging with the platform each day.","Every time they do, they share a bit of information about themselves: what they like, who their friends are, what they want to watch. That data is the product Facebook sells to advertisers who want to target specific customers.","If the Cambridge Analytica scandal leads to tougher data protection regulations – as some policymakers are demanding – or puts people off sharing as much about themselves online, that could hurt Facebook's revenue, and that of all social media platforms.

For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.

The harvesting was reportedly carried out\nin 2014 by Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer in psychology at the University\nof Cambridge, using a Facebook app, which was downloaded by about three\nhundred thousand users. At the time, Facebook’s data-sharing policies\nwere far more permissive than they are now: simply by authorizing an\napp, users could give developers access not only to their own data—photos, work histories, birthdays,\nreligious and political affiliations—but\nalso to the data of all their friends.","Facebook has bristled at the suggestion that what Kogan and Cambridge\nAnalytica did constitutes a breach. “People knowingly provided their\ninformation, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive\npieces of information were stolen or hacked,” Paul Grewal, the company’s\ndeputy counsel, stated last\nSaturday.\nBut the furor has continued, amid reports that Stephen Bannon, the\nformer chief strategist of Trump’s campaign, oversaw the collection of\nthe\ndata and used it to craft messaging for Trump’s Presidential bid. On\nWednesday, Facebook’s C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, addressed the\n“Cambridge Analytica\nsituation” in a\npost, writing, “We will learn from this experience to secure our\nplatform further and make our community safer for everyone going\nforward.”","It wasn’t Zuckerberg’s first mea culpa. In the past eighteen months,\nthanks in no small part to Trump’s victory, he and other Silicon Valley\nleaders have been forced to reckon with the sometimes negative\nrole that their companies play in Americans’ lives—fake news, ideological\necho chambers, Russian bots. Now Facebook and the public face two\ncrucial questions: How did we get here? And can the platform be fixed?","We asked a handful of writers who have covered technology for The New\nYorker—Adrian\nChen, Nathan\nHeller, Andrew\nMarantz, and\nAnna Wiener—to\ndiscuss these questions over e-mail and suggest something like a way\nforward. We began with Zuckerberg’s recent post. The participants’\nremarks have been edited for length and clarity.","Adrian Chen: Zuckerberg’s apology jumps between two distinct\nissues—one technical, one human—in a way that gives me whiplash. The\nfirst issue he lays out and shuts down with aplomb. He explains that, in\n2014, Facebook made it so that third-party apps like Kogan’s could\nharvest the data of users’ friends only if those friends also opted into\nthe app. If that were the only problem, then this would be an\nopen-and-shut case. Alas, there’s also the human problem—the problem of\nshady developers. The only thing that Zuckerberg offers here is harm\nreduction. Going forward, he writes, Facebook will “require developers\nto not only get approval but also sign a contract in order to ask anyone\nfor access to their posts or other private data.” Of course, Cambridge\nAnalytica formally certified to Facebook that it had destroyed the data\nfrom Kogan’s app, then, according to the Times report, may have failed\nto do so. The larger problem, though, is that the winding path the data\ntook, from Facebook to Kogan to Cambridge Analytica, suggests that\nprotecting users’ information once it is in the developer ecosystem is\nincredibly difficult. You get a real\nputting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle feeling.","Maybe Zuckerberg hopes that, by laying out this narrative, he’ll offer a\npicture of a technical loophole that has already been closed. But the\nhuman vulnerability is as present as ever. The only good news, it seems,\nis that it will be a little less violating next time.","Anna Wiener: That statement! There’s so much going on there, and\nalso not that much at all. It reads to me like a postmortem for a\nsoftware project, run through the communications and legal departments.\nIt’s a gesture at transparency, but it’s very slippery.","Adrian, I think you’re exactly right that this is both a technical\nproblem and a human problem, and that Zuckerberg is pushing the\nnarrative of bad actors who exploited a loophole. But if we can call it\na loophole at all, then it’s a policy loophole: Facebook was operating\nexactly as it was intended to. It was and is an ad network. The scope of\nthe metadata that developers could harvest (and retain) probably isn’t\nsurprising to anyone who has worked in ad tech, or at any tech company,\nreally. Facebook trusted developers to do the right thing, and I think\nthis reliance on good faith—a phrase that gets a lot of exercise in the\ntech industry—tracks with a sort of tech-first, developer-is-king\nmind-set.","In some ways, this trust in developers is a product of carelessness, but\nit’s also a product of a lack of imagination: it rests on the assumption\nthat what begins as a technical endeavor remains a technical endeavor.\nIt also speaks to a greater tension in the industry, I think, between\ntechnical interests (what’s exciting, new, useful for developers) and\nthe social impact of these products. I don’t know how software is built\nat Facebook, but I imagine that the engineering team working on the\nGraph A.P.I., a developer tool that enables interaction with the\nplatform’s user relationships, probably wasn’t considering the ways in\nwhich metadata could be exploited. It’s not necessarily their job to\nhypothesize about developers who might create, say, fifteen apps, then\ncorrelate the data sets in order to build out comprehensive user\nprofiles. That said, maybe it should be the job of the\nproduct-management team. I don’t mean to lean too heavily on conjecture;\nFacebook is a black box, and it’s nearly impossible to know the\ncompany’s internal politics.","In any case, the underlying issues aren’t specific to Facebook. The\nquestion of good faith is an industry-wide problem. Data retention is an\nindustry-wide problem. Transparency is touted as a virtue in Silicon\nValley, but when it comes to the end user, transparency is still treated\nas more of a privilege than a right.","Andrew Marantz: To Adrian’s point: harm reduction is better than\nnothing. I’m all for harm reduction. And yet I agree with both of you\nthat the human problem isn’t going away, because the human problem is:\nhumans. We’ll eventually have driverless cars, even if a few pedestrians\nget killed in the process; we’ll eventually have bankless currency,\nwhether it drives the banks out of business or not; but we’ll never have\npersonless social media. (Or, if we do, it won’t be profitable for long;\nadvertisers can’t sell widgets to scripts and bots.)","Zuckerberg, in his recent apology mini-tour, left behind a lot of tea\nleaves. The statement that most piqued my interest was this one, from\nhis interview on\nCNN:\n“For most of the last ten years, this idea that the world should be more\nconnected was not very controversial. And now I think that there are\nstarting to be some people that question whether that is good.” As I\nnoted in a recent piece about\nReddit,\nFacebook’s mission, for most of its lifespan, was to “make the world\nmore open and connected.” (That changed\nslightly last\nJune.) Underlying the mission was a tacit assumption about human\nnature—that people are basically trustworthy and, therefore, that a more\nopen and connected world will naturally, perhaps automatically, become a\nbetter one. Now Zuckerberg is prepared to make that assumption explicit\nand to admit that “some people” are starting to lose faith in it. Who\nare “some people”? Is Zuckerberg one of them? Does he find them\npersuasive? I want to know more.","Are human beings essentially good? Are they, to use Adrian’s word,\nessentially shady? The fact that we can’t know the answer is, I think,\npart of the answer. When you place an enormous bet on the kindness of\nstrangers, you might be unpleasantly surprised. And you might break a\nfew democracies along the way.","Nathan Heller: Human nature, indeed. It occurs to me that a lot of\nthis slices into three big problems, and that they start to indicate\nwhat Facebook might do better going forward.","First, the trust problem. The good-faith presumption you were\npinpointing, Anna, obviously can’t hold in the eyes of users. There have\nbeen repeated\nissues.\nIt doesn’t help that Facebook is commercially oriented—and that few\nusers understand what, data-wise, goes on under its hood. Say the\ntransmission goes out on your car, and you take it to your mechanic, and\nthe mechanic says, “Christ! Let’s get this fixed,” and spends a few days\nwith it. Then, three months later, the transmission goes out again, and\nthe mechanic says, “Christ! Let’s get this fixed,” and you pay for the\nrepair again. And then it happens a third time! You would not be crazy\nto suspect that your mechanic is profiting from oversight. How can the\nmechanic win back your trust? Well, maybe the third repair is free.\nShould Facebook consider a step plainly against its commercial\ninterests, as a show of good faith?","Second, the culture problem. As you suggest, Andrew, since people can be\ntrustworthy and shady, both possibilities should probably be built into\nplanning. Recently, for a\npiece,\nI talked with some people at data-security companies, and the thing they\nkept emphasizing was that you can’t completely prevent data breaches.\nThey happen. What really matters is the response: how quickly you know\nabout them, how comprehensively and transparently you react. Our very\nbrilliant sawbones colleague Atul Gawande once gave a speech about\nsurgical\nrescue.\nIt turns out that complication rates at all hospitals are basically the\nsame, and what differs—what makes people die less in some than in\nothers—is “rescue” rates. Facebook seems to have a bad rescue culture.\nIt notices (or publicly acknowledges) major problems too late. It tries\nto do things with scrap following an explosion.","Third, the conceptual problem—and I think this really goes to the heart\nof the human-technical fuzziness you point out, Adrian. Platforms are\nalways talking about scalability, but they usually mean it only in a\nnarrow business sense. (“Social,” for them, is a structural term, not a\nhuman one.) A platform with 2.2 billion monthly active users should\nprobably be assessing scalability in some broader frame. What about\nsocietal scalability? Facebook’s year of problems suggests that it’s\nnot woo-woo to think this way; for all its cogitation, the tech world\nrarely frets about second-order societal effects, let alone third-order and\nfourth-order. What if Facebook convened a cabinet of unfriendly social\neconomists, media scholars, data historians, whatever—people who think\nsystemically in other frames—and let them kick tires and raise a fuss?\nThis strikes me as only a medium-insane idea.","Finally, I just want to say, lest I seem to run negative, that I was\nstrangely charmed by Zuckerberg’s as-a-father-of-daughters\nanswer.\nSay what you will; it’s on Zeitgeist.","Anna Wiener: Nathan, I think your point about Facebook’s commercial\norientation is really important. Facebook’s customers are not its users.\nIt’s a developer-oriented attention magnet that makes its money from\nadvertisers based on the strength of its users’ data. For Facebook to\ntruly prioritize user privacy could mean the collapse of its revenue\nengine. So when Zuckerberg says, “We have a responsibility to protect\nyour data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” it’s\nvery strange, because it assumes that Facebook’s primary orientation is\ntoward users. Zuckerberg runs a business, not a community; my\nunderstanding is that Facebook sees itself as a software company, not a\nsocial institution, and behaves accordingly. (Also, I was tripped up by\n“deserve”: Facebook is a default. Aside from Instagram, a social network\nowned by Facebook, or a revival of\nPath, users\ndon’t have much of a choice. Legislation recently passed in\nCongress is likely to compound this problem.)","To “fix” Facebook would require a decision on Facebook’s part about whom\nthe company serves. It’s now in the unenviable (if totally\nself-inflicted) position of protecting its users from its customers. If\nFacebook users could see themselves as advertisers likely do, they would\nprobably modify their sharing behaviors. Can the platform be both a\nfunctional social network and a lucrative ad network?","Andrew Marantz: Nathan asks whether Facebook might act against its\ncommercial self-interest as a show of good faith. In January, the\ncompany announced a change to its News Feed algorithm: it would,\nsomewhat ironically, show users less news, or at least less news of the\nprofessionally produced, non-personal variety. (It’s hard to tell real\nnews from fake news, and even the real news is a bummer these days.) “I\nexpect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement\nwill go down,” Zuckerberg wrote in a\npost explaining\nthe change. Translation: We’ll make less money, at least in the short\nterm. And yet, he added, “if we do the right thing, I believe that will\nbe good for our community and our business over the long term.”","So was this a show of good faith, or just a canny long-term strategy?\nDoes it go any distance, Anna, toward making Facebook seem like less of\na software company and more of a social institution? Companies are\ndesigned to make money, but the people who run them are not immune to\nsuch human motivations as shame and pride. Adam Mosseri, the head of\nNews Feed, was recently asked about Facebook’s role in exacerbating\nviolence against Myanmar’s Rohingya minority. “We lose some sleep over this,” he\nresponded. That’s believable, no?","Adrian Chen: I don’t buy the idea that whenever Facebook makes a\ndecision that lowers its revenue it is some meaningful sign of social\nresponsibility, or that it will necessarily lead to a better outcome.\nI’m thinking of how Zuckerberg, for the first years of Facebook’s\nexistence, absolutely refused to take advertising, because it might\ncorrupt the network. He lost a ton of money! The story is told all the\ntime to frame Zuckerberg as a sort of reluctant capitalist. But now he’s\nout there defending the advertising\nmodel as a way to bring Facebook to the masses. Maybe I’m too cynical, but it\nseems as though Facebook has been very good at spinning whatever design\nor business decision is most advantageous to it at the time as good for\nthe world, even as it grows bigger and more powerful, less actually accountable to the users it supposedly serves. I can’t be bothered with\nthe performance of altruism any more.","Anna Wiener: I agree with you, Adrian: there’s nothing morally\nsuperior about making product changes that lead to short-term revenue\ndips. I do want to pick up on something that Andrew brought up—Adam\nMosseri’s comment about losing sleep. I imagine that Facebook largely\nemploys smart, thoughtful people who want to do the right thing. For me,\nthe question is who, internally, is empowered to make product and policy\ndecisions. I suspect transitioning from operating primarily as a\nsoftware company to operating as a social institution would require an\naudit of the organizational DNA. In an interview yesterday, with\nRecode,\nZuckerberg addressed Facebook’s challenges around content and free\nspeech: “Things like, ‘Where’s the line on hate speech?’ I mean, who\nchose me to be the person that did that? I guess I have to, because\nwe’re here now, but I’d rather not.” I’d argue that Zuckerberg himself\ndoesn’t have to be the person making those decisions. Bring in some\nnew voices, and empower them. Cede the reins a bit. The traditional\nhierarchy of the average software company might have its limits when it\ncomes to Facebook.","Andrew Marantz: I should point out, as long as we’re talking about\ncynicism and who is empowered to make decisions within the company, that\nthe Times recently followed up on that Mosseri comment by asking\nZuckerberg\ndirectly,\n“Are you losing any sleep? Do you feel guilty about the role Facebook is\nplaying in the world?” Zuckerberg’s response was more than two hundred\nwords long, but it basically amounted to, “Nah, not really.”","Nathan Heller: “Every man’s insomnia is as different from his\nneighbor’s as are their daytime hopes and aspirations.” That’s F. Scott\nFitzgerald, from his cracked period. An emphasis may fall on the\ndifference in hope.","You make an acute point, Anna—and I certainly don’t think you’re\ncynical, Adrian. Facebook is a big company with an even bigger platform;\nit has commercial momentum and pressures presumably larger than any one\nperson’s general good intent. How do you get the apparatus on the right\nside of your supposed values? Andrew, I think this pertains to the\nJanuary News Feed change. I guess I should have said “plainly against\nits commercial interests and in support of a long-term benefit for\nusers” (who, as you point out, Anna, have had mostly sweet nothings\nwhispered in their ears so far). Surely, for users, the best solution to\nfake news isn’t less news. A show of good faith, I’d imagine, would\nrequire a deeper cut than that.","I like that we’ve landed on the phrase “social responsibility.” It seems\nlike possibly the core of our concerns. What does social responsibility\nmean for a tech giant like Facebook (but not just for Facebook)? We\nhaven’t really discussed regulatory parameters, but, in a sense,\nresponsibility parameters come first. There has been a tendency in\nSilicon Valley to think of social responsibility as something on top of\nthe platform: a mission, or a service base, or just something that you\ndo with all your cash. I wonder whether, through Facebook’s missteps,\nwe’re arriving at a reckoning with the idea that social responsibility\nis inherent in the nitty-gritty of a platform itself: how information\ntravels, how its transfer is guarded, how the platform’s algorithms are\ndesigned. That would be a very different notion than what has\ntraditionally obtained, certainly in the public eye. It’s like a social\nethics of coding. Is this a healthy, useful reckoning to come to? I’d\nsay yes."],"isopubdate":""}

The Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) March 15 announced the decision on its website to fine each company the maximum possible for the violations. The decision comes amid a series of European probes into how the companies have handled user data since Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014.","The Spanish agency said WhatsApp failed to meet Spanish and European privacy standards when it transferred user data to Facebook without obtaining user consent. Facebook subsequently violated privacy law by using this data for its own means without user permission, the agency said.","Spain’s action comes during heightened European scrutiny into how Facebook and WhatsApp handle user data. Facebook had told European regulators it would not transfer user data before buying the messaging-service company. In 2016, WhatsApp then changed its terms of service to begin sharing user data with Facebook.","A German court March 1 ruled that Facebook could not store WhatsApp data. Whatsapp March 14 pledged to the U.K. privacy regulator that it would not share data with Facebook, and France recently issued a formal order to WhatsApp, seeking to force it to stop sharing data with Facebook without user consent.","Facebook was fined 110 million euros ($136 million) by the European Commission in 2017 for misleading the EU’s regulator during the 2014 review of the WhatsApp takeover.","The Spanish privacy authority said the companies violated article 11 of the Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data (LOPD) by not obtaining “free, specific and informed” user consent before sharing data.","WhatsApp users that wanted continued access to the messaging service in 2016 had to accept the change of terms without being given adequate information or the clear option to refuse them, the Spanish agency said. New users to the messenger service were never given the option to withhold their data from being shared with Facebook, the agency said."],"isopubdate":""}

Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report.","Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of Kogan's data was used in its 2016 election work for the \"avoidance of doubt.\"","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","The Facebook blog post, written by deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Trump's general-election campaign.","Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","\"The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\"","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.","A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.","The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.","Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized. Flynn is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference after pleading guilty to a felony charge.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nix said Assange denied the request, which came after Assange had said publicly that he had the emails. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.","Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling.","Revelations that Cambridge Analytica misused social media data could also be of interest to Mueller's investigation. While much of the thrust of special counsel's investigation has been tightly held, Mueller has requested that the firm turn over the emails of any employees who worked on the campaign, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last year.","Mueller is also looking at the role Wikileaks played in acquiring and making public the stolen Clinton campaign emails."],"isopubdate":""}

It’s possible that an investigation could lead to enforcement action and fines for Facebook. A representative for FTC told BuzzFeed News the agency had no additional comment on the investigation.","This isn’t the first time Facebook has been dinged by the FTC over user privacy. In 2011, Facebook and the FTC reached a settlement over charges that it deceived its users in a variety of ways, including: sharing posts that were marked “Friends Only” with third-party apps, storing data after users deleted their accounts, and sharing user data with advertisers after promising it wouldn’t. As part of the settlement, Facebook had to agree to several measures of transparency about user privacy, including \"giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtaining their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings,\" preventing anyone from accessing data from deleted accounts, and getting a third-party privacy checkup every two years.","The user data taken by a researcher through a quiz app that was later sold to Cambridge Analytica happened in 2014, years after the FTC settlement. \"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,\" according to a statement in Monday's FTC release.","Here is the full statement by Tom Pahl, acting director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection:","The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers.

Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.

But he will serve as an outspoken player for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump broke over the weekend from the longstanding advice of some of his lawyers that he refrain from directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a sign of his growing unease with the investigation.","“Former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers. “I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.”","Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president. “There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”","Little evidence has emerged to support that theory.","Mr. Trump’s legal team has been in tumult in recent weeks. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at the time that he was speaking for the president but later backtracked. According to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging to call for an end to the inquiry.","Earlier this month, Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers that he was in discussions with another Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, about representing him. Mr. Flood represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.","Mr. diGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. Ms. Toensing has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.","Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who supposedly had damaging information on Hillary Clinton.","Mr. diGenova has worked in Washington legal circles for decades. He is a former Republican-appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia. And he has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George H.W. Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton.","Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role of the independent counsel — as defined in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal — ought to be narrowed.","Drawing on his own experience, Mr. diGenova said in 1998 that the law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, should not be renewed. He argued that once the independent counsel law was invoked, the prosecutors were forced into bringing “an unnatural degree of targeted attention” to the case. In 1999, the United States Congress let the independent counsel portions of the law expire."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

{"originalurl":"https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-is-what-facebook-powered-election-cheating-looks-like.html","title":"The Cambridge Analytica scandal is what Facebook-powered election cheating looks like:","text":["The Trump campaign’s data firm got its hands on 50 million Facebook users’ information—and then reportedly lied about deleting it.","On Friday night, as Americans began settling into the weekend, Facebook dropped a pretty substantial piece of news: The company said in a detailed blog post that it had suspended from its platform the political-data firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign during the 2016 election, after learning the company hadn’t deleted Facebook user data it had obtained in violation of the social network’s policies.","Facebook said that a Russian-American psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan had obtained user data through a personality app he built in 2014 called “thisisyourdigitallife,” which scraped data from the profiles of people who took the quiz as well as that of their friends—something that was allowed under Facebook’s policy for third-party apps at the time. Although only about 270,000 people took the survey, the New York Times reports that Kogan was able to obtain data on 50 million users, likely through connections between friends on the network. While the project promised users the data collection was only for research purposes, it nevertheless funneled the data to Cambridge Analytica, which had funded the development of the app to the tune of $800,000. Kogan had also received funding from the Russian government for his research into the psychology of Facebook users, the Guardian reported.","We don’t yet know how effective Cambridge Analytica’s targeting, based on psychological profiles its CEO has described as its “secret sauce,” truly was, but after working with Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign in the Republican primary, Cambridge Analytica was tapped by the Trump campaign. The company also did data analytics work on the successful Leave.EU campaign that resulted in a vote for Britain to exit the European Union. What we do seem to have, following these revelations about the source of some of the company’s data, is yet another in a long string of instances and coincidences—like the meetings between Trump campaign staff and Russian operatives—that look a lot like a willingness to cheat to win the White House, possibly in violation of the law. And in this case, cheating with data that was taken through Facebook’s front door.","Cambridge Analytica isn’t your typical data analytics firm. Its primary backer is Robert Mercer, the secretive billionaire and former CEO of the New York investment firm Renaissance Technologies whose family is also one of the main funders of Breitbart News and was the largest donor to Trump-backing Super PACs during the 2016 election. Steve Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, was the vice president of Cambridge Analytica’s board at the same time he was chairman of Breitbart News.","The data firm started partnering with U.S. political campaigns around 2015 with the promise that it had the ability to do what it called “psychographic” targeting, which allowed Cambridge Analytica to create psychological profiles to “effectively engage and persuade voters using specially tailored language and visual ad combinations” that appeal to each person on an emotional level, according to Cambridge Analytica’s website. The company claims it’s able to build these profiles by leveraging “up to 5,000 data points on over 230 million American voters.” That last number is a lot bigger than the 50 million people reported in the New York Times, and it’s unclear where that remaining data came from.","Cambridge Analytica began contracting for Trump’s campaign in June 2016, roughly six months after the Guardian reported that the company, when working for Cruz, was targeting voters using data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge. Facebook confirmed in August 2016 that data from Kogan’s app collected and misused data from the company and that Facebook was taking efforts to delete it. Still, Facebook didn’t alert users that their data had potentially ended up in the hands of Republican operatives.","The personality quiz created by Kogan appeared in 2014 on a platform for freelancers run by Amazon called Mechanical Turk.* The quiz, posted by Kogan’s company Global Science Research, offered to pay participants $1 or $2 to complete it and also required participants to download an app and consent to sharing data about themselves and their social network. At the time the quiz and app were running, Facebook permitted app developers to access data about a person’s network, like the names of their friends, as well as their likes and other personal details about themselves and their network, according to Facebook’s head of security, Alex Stamos, in a series of now-deleted tweets. The company says it has now updated its policies to let users decide what information Facebook can share about them.","Facebook says, however, that when Kogan passed the data he collected to Cambridge Analytica, he violated the company’s rather permissive data collection rules and in 2015 demanded that Kogan and everyone he handed the data to destroy it and certify that they did so. Facebook says it received certifications that the data was deleted from both Kogan and Cambridge Analytica, as well as from Christopher Wylie, who helped to found Cambridge Analytica. (Wylie and other former employees of the company gave interviews to the New York Times and the Guardian about Cambridge Analytica.) But apparently not all the data was deleted, and the New York Times reports that it was able to view a portion of the Facebook user data that still exists. The contract that Kogan initially had with Cambridge Analytica also allowed him to keep a copy of the data he scrapped for his research.","Kogan claimed in an email to Cambridge Analytica in 2014 that the data he was collecting would be able to predict a person’s neuroticism, political views, agreeableness, and interests in things like militarism, horoscopes, and the environment. These data points could be what Cambridge Analytica is referring to when it claims that it’s capable of psychologically targeting American voters.","“Without Facebook, we wouldn’t have won,” said Theresa Hong, a member of the digital arm of Trump’s presidential campaign, in an interview with the BBC last year when giving a tour of Trump’s digital campaign headquarters, dubbed Project Alamo, in San Antonio, Texas. Alamo was the name of the dataset used by Cambridge Analytica, according to Hong, who said Cambridge Analytica shared offices with the Trump campaign’s digital efforts and confirmed Facebook and Google sent liaisons to their offices to help Trump’s campaign. Hong showed the BBC how Cambridge Analytica could identify if, say, it was targeting a working mother concerned about childcare: She probably wouldn’t be interested in “a war ridden destructive ad” popping up in her Facebook app, but might respond to something more “warm and fuzzy,” lacking Trump’s voice, Hong said. “It wasn’t uncommon to have about 35 to 45 thousand iterations of these types of ads everyday.”","Cambridge Analytica also bragged publicly about its use of data and voter modeling during the election, which sparked the interest of David Carroll, a professor at Parsons School of Design who studies media, data targeting, and campaigns. In January 2017, he requested under the U.K.’s data protection law to see if any of his personal data had been shipped to Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, based in London. Last year, Carroll learned that Cambridge Analytica had given him scores on a scale of 1 to 10 on certain hot-button political categories, like a “gun rights importance rank.” Based on these scores, he was ultimately listed as “unlikely” to vote Republican. On Friday, the same day Facebook moved to suspend Cambridge Analyica’s account, Carrol filed a legal claim in the U.K. to learn what the company did with his data and if it was handed to anyone else.","Cambridge Analytica was roped into Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election this past December when it requested to see employee emails, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The firm also may be in hot water with the Federal Election Commission, which has rules about how non-U.S. persons are allowed to work on political campaigns. Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, is British and many of the company’s employees were either European or Canadian.","On Saturday, Cambridge Analytica responded to Facebook’s allegations and the reports in the New York Times and Guardian, writing that Wylie was a contractor and not a founder of the company and claiming that all of the Facebook data provided by Kogan was erased as soon as the company learned it was obtained illegitimately.","This isn’t a spy movie. We’re a data analytics company doing research & analysis on commercial, public and data sets for clients 7/8","In his now-deleted Twitter thread, Facebook’s Stamos said that Kogan’s handing of Facebook user data to Cambridge Analytica wasn’t technically a breach, since he “didn’t break into any systems, bypass technical controls, or use a flaw in our system to gather more data than allowed.” All of which means Kogan took a startling amount of user data that he was permitted to take—even if he wasn’t supposed to hand it over to a voter-targeting operation after taking it. Other app developers may have harvested data from users in the way Krogan and Cambridge Analytica did under Facebook’s old rules, too, and there’s no telling where that data might have ended up. Since 2015, Facebook has changed its policies, limiting the amount of user data third-party apps can siphon from the network—although it still allows sophisticated political targeting through its advertising platform, the kind which the Trump campaign was able to use, likely abetted by the Cambridge Analytica data set. None of this is surprising, of course, but it should be galling. Facebook’s primary job is making money, after all—and even careful policies can’t always control for the scrupulousness of how its customers use its primary product: our data.","Correction, March 19, 2018: This article originally misspelled the name of the platform Mechanical Turk."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts.

And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it.","\"All kinds of people had access to the data,\" said Wylie, who helped develop Cambridge Analytica's methods for using the information to target and persuade voters. \"It was everywhere.\"","Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ, a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave, the official campaign backing Britain's withdrawal from the EU, Wylie said.","Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company, SCL Group, that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun-for-hire, often in countries where democratic institutions are weak. He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost.","The 28-year-old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013. He left the next year.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign. It denies any wrongdoing.","Cambridge Analytica's acting CEO, Alexander Tayler, said in a statement that Wylie was a part-time contractor who \"has no direct knowledge of our work or practices\" since he left the company.","Wylie said he \"absolutely\" believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica's databases for its work on the Brexit campaign. In the closely fought referendum in 2016, 51.9 percent of voters backed Britain's departure from the EU.","\"I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning,\" Wylie said.","He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn't want to relocate to Britain. The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a \"department,\" he said.","Because of the links between the two companies, Vote Leave got the \"the next best thing\" to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ, \"a company that can do virtually everything that (Cambridge Analytica) can do but with a different billing name,\" Wylie said.","AggregateIQ, based in Victoria, British Columbia, issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL.","\"AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates,\" the company said. \"All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client.\"","Wylie's testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign.","They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625,000 pounds ($888,000) to the pro-Brexit student group BeLeave, which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ."],"isopubdate":""}

Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said last week of rumors of the FTC action, “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”","The controversy has roiled company stock, and the announcement Monday of the federal agency probe sent the company’s stock sliding even further, down nearly four points at its lowest midday trading point.","Cambridge Analytica has previously said it was unaware the data was improperly obtained by a third party, and the firm says it cooperated with Facebook in deleting all the social media company’s data and related information in 2015. Such material was not utilized as part of its work with the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, the data firm said.","The Trump campaign has said it never used data from Cambridge Analytica.\nThe Judiciary Committee, for its part, said it plans to cover “privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use. It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Grassley also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss mounting privacy concerns and “how to develop ‘rules of the road’ that encourage companies to develop tailored approaches to privacy that satisfy consumer expectations while maintaining incentives for innovation.”","Pressure is building for Zuckerberg, in particular, to face what will surely be a series of public grillings, as the list of congressional panels demanding his appearance grows.","Already, the embattled billionaire businessman has received requests from the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has said it intends to extend an invite, as its panel continues its more than 14-month long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.","There are also international demands for Zuckerberg to appear before government panels in the UK, Australia, and beyond.","“On a bipartisan basis, we believe Mr. Zuckerberg’s testimony is necessary to gain a better understanding of how the company plans to restore lost trust, safeguard users’ data, and end a troubling series of belated responses to serious problems,” Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, said last week in a joint statement.","Some in Congress have even begun to threaten regulation of an industry that has long fought against any curb of its activities.","“These tech platforms who are extraordinarily powerful who’ve been great iconic American success stories - they need to be more forthcoming or Washington is going to start imposing rules and regulations that may not fit,” warned Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and, himself, a former tech industry entrepreneur and investor.","Warner, who had just months ago insisted on a “light touch” to try to press Silicon Valley into action, has seemed to grow more frustrated with the tech CEO’s since last year, when Facebook, Google, and Twitter sent their top lawyers – instead of coming themselves – to the Intelligence panel to testify regarding their role in Russia’s 2016 interference.","“Facebook has -since the beginning of this investigation - have been reluctant, to say the least, to be fully forthcoming,” Warner said, adding, “I think it’s time for the CEO, Mr. Zuckerberg, and other top officials to come and testify and not tell part of the story but tell the whole story of their involvement, not only with the Trump campaign but their ability to have their platform misused by the Russians.”","Last Thursday, Facebook sent a handful of senior staff to brief aides to a number of key Senate and House committees on the most recent controversy.","The same panels on both sides of Congress who are demanding that Zuckerberg appear also want to hear from Cambridge Analytica executives, including its now-suspended CEO Alexander Nix and former data firm employee Christopher Wylie. The latter told ABC News that he had already accepted House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence’s invitation.","“One of the reasons why I’m speaking out is because I think that it’s really concerning that no one has really investigated Cambridge Analytica and its role in the 2016 election,” Wylie told ABC News in a recent interview.","Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence panel, also invited Russian-American researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who developed the initial app approved by Facebook to collect data on 227,000 of its users.","Kogan previously told ABC News that Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are making him a “scapegoat.”","ABC News also reported Monday that Government watchdog group Common Cause filed a pair of legal complaints with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the Department of Justice accusing Cambridge Analytica LTD, its parent company SCL Group Limited, CEO Alexander Nix, SCL co-founder Nigel Oakes, data scientist Alexander Tayler, and former employee-turned-whistleblower Christopher Wylie of violating federal election laws that prohibit foreigners from participating directly or indirectly in the decision-making process of U.S. political campaigns."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

It might be a wake-up call. - The Washington Post","text":["Here’s how to download all your data from Facebook. It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information. According to Facebook, that download might also include the “unique number” Facebook assigns to you for facial recognition purposes, based on the photos you’ve been tagged in on the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people's relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica - unlike other firms that access Facebook's user data - broke Facebook's rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook's systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network's information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook's data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, \"likes\" and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook's popular \"log-in through Facebook\" feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user's Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn't misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers' databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted - and how everyday users understood those permissions - is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it \"fully complies with Facebook's terms of service.\"","The newspaper, citing current and former employees it did not name, said Alex Stamos will leave after a disagreement over how the social network should deal with its role in spreading misinformation.","It...","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings - after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian manipulation of its site connected to the 2016 election.","\"While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people's information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people's private information,\" Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and John Neely Kennedy, R-La., wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook's shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\" Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million \"friends,\" the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","\"Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users' friends' data,\" said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users' friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","\"The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,\" said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers' privacy practices until 2012. \"Protecting users did not fit into that.\" Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company's data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, \"This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends's birthdays, photos, and likes.\"","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook's allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person's friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,\" Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. \"We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, \"that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.\"","Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. \"FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info - now a hollow promise,\" Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, \"We've heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.\" That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend's data were used by third parties.","Facebook \"goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,\" said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. \"No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It's entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.\"","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook's log-in button to sign on to the campaign's website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends' information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people's relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","\"We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,\" Davidsen said in an interview. \"We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.\"","FarmVille's developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

But until the last few weeks, there’s a good chance you weren’t thinking about it. On its data policy page, Facebook explains it collects information about things you based on information you provide, such as location check-ins or dates associated with pictures you add to your page. The company also collects similar information about others who share photos of you or send messages to you. It also collects information about payments you make – like when you spend money on a game or make a donation – as well as the type of device you’re using.","The company uses this information in lots of ways.\nStart with advertising. Facebook can take any of the information it collects from you and use it to offer ads that might interest you. For example, if you love wearing Air Jordans and you make that clear on your Facebook account, you might start seeing ads for companies advertising the newest pair of sneakers. The company says it also uses a lot of the information to improve your overall experience on Facebook.","Even your apps have a lot of access to your Facebook account.\nIf you’ve ever taken the “which West Wing character am I?” quiz or any similar survey, there’s a good chance you’ve given some third-party access to your Facebook account. Chances are you just wanted to know which character you are similar to and quickly approved the app to have all of that access. If you want see just how many apps are connected your Facebook account, go the top right corner of your page (on a desktop) and click the down-facing arrow located to the right of the question mark. Then click “settings” and you’ll be brought to that says “General Account Settings.” On the left side of the screen, click “apps.” That will bring you to a list of the apps that have access to your account. On a mobile device, open the Facebook app, tap the bottom right corner of the screen and scroll down to “settings.” Tap “account settings” and scroll down and tap “apps.”","You can download all of the information Facebook has on you.\nWarning: if you’ve active on Facebook for a long time, some of the things you download might surprise you. If you want see everything the company has, you can follow a similar process to the one listed above for accessing the apps connected to your account. Go the top right corner of your page (on a desktop) and click the down facing arrow located to the right of the question mark. Then click “settings” and you’ll be brought to that says “General Account Settings.” The click “Download a copy of your Facebook data.”","You can deactivate your Facebook account.\nThis is a trend that seems to be gaining traction following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved a consulting firm gaining access to tens of millions of Facebook profiles.

At present, mobile users see a list of about 17 different options, each of which is marked by a short title.","However, the new version regroups the controls and adds descriptions to make it simpler.","Now, there is a new privacy shortcuts menu. The dashboard brings together what the firm said \"were the most critical controls into a single place. It suggested this will make it faster for people to do things such as review the posts they have shared or reacted to, and to limit the information used to target ads at them.","Also, a new page called Access Your Information allows users to review past interactions with the site -- including the things they have \"liked\" and the comments they have posted -- with the option to make deletions.","In addition, members will be able to download specific categories of data -- including their photos -- from a selected time range, rather than only being able to export a single large file that might take hours to obtain.","The action preceded the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will come into force on May 25. The new law will toughen the requirements on how organisations handle the public's data, as well as impose harsher penalties for breaches."],"isopubdate":""}

Watson","Sara M. Watson is a technology critic and an affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University.","October 12, 2017","Have you taken a close look at your ads lately?","Washington and Silicon Valley have been shocked by each new discovery recently of how Russian operatives bought ads on Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media networks during the 2016 campaign. Kremlin-linked troll farms bought cheap advertising with a very wide reach, possibly getting their messages in front of millions of American voters.","Such ads are our clearest example yet of the ways that personalization and microtargeting — basics in the business of data on the Internet — can be weaponized.","And it’s not just ads we need to worry about — it’s all forms of personalization. In a world where more and more interfaces are personalized, we need better means to exert our preferences and protect against misuse. Russian interference using standard business practices such as buying ads on Facebook puts into stark relief the lack of oversight of the potential misuses and abuses of technologies that filter our daily lives.","Ads are the best signal we have to show us how our personal data is being used. We’ve begun to see examples of how targeted advertising online has moved from the commercial into the political sphere. ProPublica has reported that Facebook made it possible for advertisers to target racial proxies buying ads for categories like “ethnic affinity groups” and “jew haters.” An Australian Facebook ad team presented leaked research suggesting how emotionally unstable teens might be targeted. The Trump campaign deployed “Super Predator” dark posts targeting black voters to suppress turnout just before the election. But Russia’s digital tactics demonstrate just how far exploitative microtargeting can go.","Today there is no neutral interface, no unfiltered feed. From music recommendations to algorithmically generated news feeds, even search results and front pages of news sources, our digital lives are tailored to match our unique behavioral patterns. We can’t toggle between a neutral experience and a personalized one.","Most of what feeds into microtargeting is based on assumptions — algorithms observe past behavior, process it through a prioritization system and spit back out more of what you will like, or what will get you to spend more of your money or time. At best, these systems anticipate our needs and interests and tailor our experience accordingly. At worst, though, they are deployed to take advantage of us.","It’s hard to find the fuzzy line between appropriate uses and misuses of the technology. What’s the difference between a retargeted ad selling shoes vs. one discussing protection of the Second Amendment?","This is about more than just annoying ads. It’s about our agency to understand and control the interfaces with which we live every day.","Facebook has responded with an action plan to address election integrity issues. Ads targeted to various users will be available on one page for users to compare to what others are seeing. Facebook will also finally make political advertising disclosures more transparent, as regulation of TV and other media already requires. But these efforts do not address the wider influence of microtargeting and personalization on this and other platforms.","Interfaces dealing in user data need to be held accountable to their users. Beyond the ones Facebook has proposed, there are a number of solutions that platforms and regulators can pursue.","First, interfaces need to develop means of expressing the degree to which an experience is personalized to users. This allows platforms to explain the inputs that go into the personalized feed or recommendation, and also gives users a means of interacting with and responding to those inputs or algorithm weights. Imagine telling the Facebook feed that for the next week you want to see more news articles and fewer cat videos. Platforms can test their assumptions against us and provide even better personalized experiences. We need that level of granular control over the personalized interfaces to gain more control and agency over our experiences.","Second, we need to apply some of the lessons from traditional advertising to the Wild West that is online advertising. We need to regulate appropriate and inappropriate uses of microtargeting, with consumer protection principles in mind. Whether updating Federal Election Commission regulations for political advertising standards, or looking to industry self-regulation as was once done for subliminal advertising, further oversight over digital targeting is needed.","Finally, we need to develop more data and better literacy of these practices to develop normative stances on what are acceptable and appropriate forms of targeting. The Russian-bought ads have struck a nerve, but we need more examples of microtargeting out in the open to clearly articulate our appetite for personalized experiences.","Facebook allows users to manage the categories its algorithms have determined you might be interested in, often based on apps you’ve installed or pages you’ve liked or interacted with. We can also ask, “Why Am I Seeing This Ad?” about a particular ad by clicking on the “…” in the top right corner of a post or ad. You might be included on brands’ customer list or could be targeted in a broad category such as “women ages 18 to 34 who live in the United States.” You can also use the same feature to remove certain people or publications from your feed. For now, though, these opportunities to provide input happen through micro-interactions or are buried in Ad Preferences settings.","These approaches won’t solve all problems. We may remove protected categories from ad-targeting drop-down menus, but advanced data services such as Cambridge Analytica will be able to microtarget based on proprietary email lists. Platforms maintain that giving users more control results in information overload and management fatigue, but the option for further insight and control needs to exist for at least the savviest users. For the rest of us, we need mechanisms for oversight to identify instances of misuse and abuse to protect against further exploitation and manipulation.","Subliminal advertising has been regulated away — for good reason. This is the modern equivalent in our digital lives. It’s time we take personalization personally."],"isopubdate":"2018-02-26"}
{"originalurl":"http://mailchi.mp/thefamily/enough-with-the-facebook-bashing","title":"Enough with the Facebook bashing","text":["Last week was dominated by Facebook’s latest series of problems. A worldwide scandal has erupted following the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a firm that worked for the Trump campaign in 2016, has illegally diverted data about millions of Facebook users’ social graphs.","I happen to know the technological context quite well. Back in 2010-2012, I was the CEO of a Paris-based tech startup whose core business was to exploit information about people’s social graphs. Following the example of the 2008 Obama presidential campaign, my cofounders and I were seeking to orchestrate value-creating relationships between individuals who didn’t know each other but had a lot in common—whether it was to help elect a candidate, find a new job or purchase a new product.","Now, I have to say, we didn’t collect too much data. Like many startups, mine never really took off. But I remember that third-party developers like us were authorized to collect information about people’s social graph through the Facebook Graph API. I also remember the restrictions: obviously the user had to express consent; I think we weren’t allowed to store personal information on our own servers; and we were strictly forbidden from selling the data to another party—a rule that was blithely violated in Cambridge Analytica's case. (And by the way, Facebook terminated that API feature in 2014.)","My point is this: in the current discussion about data and privacy, we shouldn’t confuse the technical availability of data (Facebook) and said data being used in violation of the attached rules (Cambridge Analytica). In fact, we have to realize that there are many cases in which people’s data are easily accessible, even out in the open; however, it’s still illegal to use them for certain purposes.","One case for understanding this is being a parent. The fact that you have children can hardly be hidden from parties such as your employer. Yet this very fact can lead to discrimination (because you have children, you won’t be as dedicated as your childless colleagues, blah blah blah). But would you ever consider hiding the fact that you have children? No—you even tend to be proud of them. And so the solution is not to try and hide your loved ones. It’s to impose strict anti-discrimination rules that make it harder/illegal to disadvantage a worker because they have children that regularly require care at home.","It's the same for sexuality. We’re slowly exiting the terrible world of “Don’t ask, don’t tell”, in which it was customary to hide the fact of being LGBTQ because it could lead to retaliation/discrimination, notably in the workplace, retail or matters of housing. It’s much better to encourage people to come out (which boosts social acceptance, as seen over the last decade) and punish those who keep discriminating against them. This is another case in which the solution is not to prevent the collecting of personal data, but rather to repress organizations that misuse them (whether it’s the government, an employer, or predatory businesses such as Cambridge Analytica).","The longer we focus on Facebook as the problem (despite the fact that they had appropriate terms of service), the more we weaken the simple idea that rules should exist to forbid what Cambridge Analytica did. It's a very different focus: in one case, it’s on Facebook collecting personal data; in the other, it’s on third parties misusing this data and violating Facebook's terms of service—which Facebook apparently spotted and castigated in that particular case (even if their PR efforts have been rather atrocious).","Let me share three ideas. First, it’s not so much that privacy is obsolete. It’s that we need to refine the idea of privacy and introduce new categories.","On the one hand there are private data that are out in the open but that other parties are not allowed to use against me (or to manipulate me). There’ll be more and more attempts to do so (third parties using abundant personal data to manipulate people or discriminate against them), so we should be prepared to enact and enforce rules to prevent it instead of succumbing to anti-data collection hysteria.","On the other hand, there are data that simply shouldn’t be collected, like pictures of what happens in our bedroom or the thoughts you share with your therapist (or confessor). This is a different category, a particular version of privacy that we could call “intimacy”.","Second, introducing new categories is critical because the flow of personal data is to the Entrepreneurial Age what the flow of automobiles was to the Fordist economy: it’s highly dangerous, but it creates a tremendous amount of value and now determines our way of life, so we have to live with it.","The flow of personal data is not going away because it makes it possible to improve the user experience—something we all enjoy as consumers. In this context, a successful company is one that, just like Facebook, inspires enough trust so that individuals consent to regular and systematic data collection, which in turn makes it possible to personalize the experience, which in turn inspires more trust.","On the other hand, once that positive feedback loop is broken, it is swiftly replaced by a negative feedback loop, in which lack of trust leads to resistance against data collection, which in turn degrades the experience, which further affects trust. For Facebook, it's far from certain that the scandal is enough to break what has so far been an impressive, trust-generating positive feedback loop. But in the presence of increasing returns, that kind of butterfly effect is enough to turn winners into losers.","Third, I think that the most vocal people hate Facebook not because of what happened with Cambridge Analytica, but for political reasons. Conservatives have always hated Silicon Valley because it’s liberal. Now liberals hate Silicon Valley because its tools somehow played a role in Trump’s victory in 2016. And so the scandal exists not because Facebook was careless with data. It exists because a particular use of data has struck a responsive chord in people—one that resounds because of political circumstances.","Where do we go from here? I don’t think that calls to “regulate tech companies” will lead us anywhere in the absence of other major societal changes. After all, a new techno-economic paradigm calls for many new institutions, not a few more regulations.","I'm a cofounder & director of The Family. This is a newsletter on entrepreneurship, finance, strategy, and policy. Each week, I'll send insights and ideas related to current events as well as my latest work, including the writing of my new book HEDGE: A Greater Safety Net for the Entrepreneurial Age.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The data was initially obtained by the developer of an app that promised to provide users with “personality predictions.”","To create those predictions, Cambridge Analytica harvested personal information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users, according to a joint investigation by The New York Times and The Observer of London published Saturday morning.","Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge, told The Observer that the company “built models to exploit what we knew” about Facebook users to “target their inner demons.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” Wylie told the Times, referring to Cambridge’s leadership.","“Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war,” added Wylie, who stopped working for the company in 2014.","The company also did extensive work to help supporters pass Brexit, prompting The Observer to accuse the operation last year of “hijacking” democracy. It continues to carry out political, governmental and military investigations and campaigns around the world.","Special counsel Robert Mueller in December called for company documents as part of his investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia.","In the latest controversy, Facebook accused the company of continuing to hold information about its users that it promised it had destroyed three years ago.","Users’ private information — such as the cities they live in, preferred content and some details about friends — were initially accessed when they downloaded the app “thisisyourdigitallife,” which was obtained through Facebook. Thisisyourdigitallife promised predictions about a user based on psychological profiles created through the app.","The app, created by a University of Cambridge psychology professor, said private data accessed to develop the profile would be used by psychologists doing research. Some 270,000 Facebook users downloaded the app, which granted him access to their information, as well as to information from their Facebook friends.","Facebook executive Andrew “Boz” Bosworth argued that the incident did not constitute a data “breach” because users voluntarily downloaded the app. Friends of the app users, however, may not have been aware their information was being recorded.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","At the time, obtaining users’ private information through the app conformed to guidelines for app developers, according to Facebook. App developer Aleksandr Kogan violated Facebook policy when he turned the data over in 2015 to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Facebook said. Kogan also provided data to Wylie, then of Eunoia Technologies, Inc., according to Facebook.","Facebook shut down the app when the company discovered Kogan’s violation and demanded that Strategic Communication Laboratories destroy obtained information, which company officials said they did, according to the Facebook statement. But Facebook just “days ago discovered” that “not all data was deleted,” according to its statement. SCL, Kogan and Wylie are now all barred from the social media platform.","Cambridge Analytica firmly denied using or holding data from Facebook profiles in its statement. The company acknowledged that it obtained data through a “seemingly reputable” academic contractor who did not comply with Facebook’s terms of service, but asserted its claim that it deleted all of the ill-gotten data and worked with Facebook through the incident.","Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie could not immediately be reached for comment.","Several users responded to Facebook on Twitter, saying user data should have been protected from Kogan from the start. Others criticized Facebook for believing Cambridge’s assurances that it destroyed the information and for waiting three years to take action.","In a statement to Wired, Facebook executive Paul Grewal said the company would take “whatever steps are required” to make sure the data is completely deleted.","New statement from Facebook VP & Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal re: Cambridge Analytica data breach: \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties.”","Massachusets Attorney General Maura Healey announced Saturday afternoon that her office would launch an investigation into Cambridge’s practices. The office of the United Kingdom’s information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, began examining use of personal data for political purposes in May 2017.","This article has been updated with additional comments from Facebook and reactions to the company’s news."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

It is created and flouted around to make the audience, the voters feel that the party is connected to them and understands their pain points.

Just ask.","To be fair, he could've been joking or showing off to his mate and this was many years before Facebook turned into the social media juggernaut it is today with 2.2 billion users and an imperative to behave ethically.","But it also shows that perhaps the Facebook founder was always relatively unconcerned about the privacy rights of his users. At least from very early on he understood the power of owning their personal information.","The company has routinely come under fire for how it uses people's data, and who it shares it with. But the latest scandal involving a shadowy company that pinched Facebook user data to help it design software to influence elections has given the company its biggest black eye yet.","British data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica has been accused of harvesting the data of some 50 million Facebook users' profiles without their knowledge to help it design software to predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box.","The firm, which is owned by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, says it can analyse consumer data — including social media and its own polling — in order to target people with marketing material.","The company's antics were reportedly used, and believed to have been highly effective, in the election of Donald Trump and the successful Brexit vote.","The inner workings of the company were revealed this week by Christopher Wylie, a Canadian data analytics specialist and whistleblower who created the company's system but has now spoken out against it.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles.

About 270,000 people agreed but due to Facebook's terms of service the app was also able to collect data of their friends. This gave the Dr Kogan the raw information of more than 50 million people, which he later handed to Cambridge Analytica.","It's not exactly what Facebook wanted but a scenario it eagerly helped create and did little to prevent, despite the company's assurances that \"protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do.\"","In a since deleted tweet, Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote: \"It is incorrect to call this a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\"","It was not a breach or a hack but rather an inevitable outcome of what's become known as surveillance capitalism — the term used to describe the data-hungry business model of big tech firms like Facebook, Google and Amazon.","THE $50 BILLION BACKLASH","As consumers become increasingly aware of the extent Facebook (and other major tech companies) harvest and use their data, there has been a growing unease among users.","And the latest scandal appears to be a tipping point for the social media company which is desperately trying to reassure the public as well as government regulators about its practices.","In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, #DeleteFacebook began trending on Twitter as users vowed to leave the social media network behind.","This morning TechCrunch published a scathing article with the same hashtag as its title.","\"Facebook is using us.

They seem to have been aware of it from the beginning, but took no action to notify users about the breach. Facebook’s failure to disclose this information violates laws in both the UK and the US. The information spill to Cambridge Analytica also seems to fly in the face of statements that Facebook representatives made to legislators on both sides of the Atlantic.","The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news.

And that includes their communications and cooperation with Russia.","As the information on Cambridge Analytica’s theft of information from Facebook users was coming to light, so was information on their communications with a state-owned Russian oil firm.","When the Russia question came up during a hearing at the British Parliament last month, Alexander Nix did not hesitate.","“We’ve never worked in Russia,” said Mr. Nix, head of a data consulting firm that advised the Trump campaign on targeting voters.","Except that was a blatant lie. Cambridge met with Russian state oil company Lukoil for at least two years. And Lukoil had some very specific concerns.","Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.","Steve Bannon, was vice president of Cambridge Analytica at the time of the Lukoil discussions, had a very clear idea of how they could use the firm to win elections, not by pushing a candidate, but by shaping American culture.","In 2014, Steve Bannon – then executive chairman of the “alt-right” news network Breitbart – was [CA Developer and Analyst Christopher] Wylie’s boss. And Robert Mercer, the secretive US hedge-fund billionaire and Republican donor, was Cambridge Analytica’s investor. And the idea they bought into was to bring big data and social media to an established military methodology – “information operations” – then turn it on the US electorate.","Steve Bannon has made no effort to disguise his intention to bring down liberal democracy and replace it with white nationalism. He’s currently on a European tour, where he’s cheered on fascism at every stop and praised Mussolini’s fashion sense—all those fetching black shirts and sharp uniforms.","Cambridge Analytica was the tool that Bannon and the Mercers built to enable their fascist utopia. Their instrument for taking everything that marketing firms has learned about selling shoes or getting people to “click here,” and putting it to use as a landmine for democracy.","We are still only just starting to understand the maelstrom of forces that came together to create the conditions for what Mueller confirmed last month was “information warfare”. But Wylie offers a unique, worm’s-eye view of the events of 2016. Of how Facebook was hijacked, repurposed to become a theatre of war: how it became a launchpad for what seems to be an extraordinary attack on the US’s democratic process.","Christopher Wylie was approached by Steve Bannon to build a “psychological warfare mindfuck tool” that would use big data and social media, not to directly market a candidate, but to drive open cracks in American culture. The intention was to ratchet up racial, gender and social concerns, increasing unrest and convincing Americans—especially white Americans—that they were being left behind in their own country.","In 2014 and 2015, as they were building their tool, Cambridge had multiple contacts with Russian officials who were, not so coincidentally, seeking exactly the same kind of information and tool that Cambridge was building.","As Cambridge moved into supporting Trump, they used the information they had derived from Facebook data, and Facebook’s own targeted ad tools, to put information in front of voters in critical areas.","The ads, stories and links that Cambridge provided were often not specifically “vote for Trump” pieces, so much as they were continuations of their cultural-change effort. They were intended to create a narrative that working class white voters were being ignored by the Democratic Party, who were wholly owned by urban blacks and immigrants, and that blacks and immigrants were benefiting while whites were “forgotten.” Added onto this was a layer of stories about emasculating feminists.","If some of this sounds like the actions of the Russian “hackers” in 2016 election, it’s because their approaches and actions were almost identical. Both start in 2014 working to cause disruption and exacerbate social unrest. Both turn to supporting Trump once he becomes a candidate. Both use Facebook data and tools to target their actions. And both contact WikiLeaks as the go-to site for laundering the release of data.","This could be astounding coincidence—but a simpler explanation is that Cambridge Analytica, Steve Bannon and others in Trump’s digital effort coordinated their entire approach with Moscow.","The second story here is Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg’s giant social media firm was aware of Cambridge’s actions at least two years ago. But rather than let users know that their information had been lifted, they handled it quietly, behind the scenes. Facebook is now beating its chest, claiming that it really thought CA had destroyed the data, and that the skimming of 50 million profiles didn’t represent a reportable “breach.”","But this story comes on top of stories that show Facebook was not only eager to market their tools to Trump—at a huge discount—but was openly selling political ads during a US election to Russian companies that were so open about their intentions that they were paying Facebook in rubles.","In testimony to a Senate judiciary subcommittee, a senior Facebook lawyer admitted that Russian operatives had used the social network to spread “deeply disturbing” content designed to aggravate America’s racial and ideological divides.","“[Bannon] got it immediately. He believes in the whole Andrew Breitbart doctrine that politics is downstream from culture, so to change politics you need to change culture. And fashion trends are a useful proxy for that. ...","But Wylie wasn’t just talking about fashion. He had recently been exposed to a new discipline: “information operations”, which ranks alongside land, sea, air and space in the US military’s doctrine of the “five-dimensional battle space”.","Facebook’s story appears to be one of such overarching greed that they would sell anything to anyone for dollars—or for rubles—and then feign innocence.","An investigation about Cambridge Analytica is slated to run in the UK this week, but the company is currently fighting to keep this information from becoming public."],"isopubdate":""}

In addition to this content, political advertisements bought by Russia may have reached as many 10 million people.","Luther Lowe, the vice-president for public policy at Yelp, told the Guardian that Facebook’s DC hiring spree represents an effort to “play catch up with Google”. He noted that Facebook’s presence in Washington is currently about half the size of Google, a company that has had several privacy scandals over the past decade.","Google’s parent company, Alphabet, spent $18m on lobbying in 2017 including $6m alone in one three-month period. This was more than any other company spent on lobbying in Washington DC. Its top lobbyist in Washington, Susan Molinari, is a former Republican congresswoman who also had a brief stint as a television anchor at CBS. The company’s chairman, Eric Schmidt, also served as an informal adviser to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016 although he has since praised Donald Trump at a White House meeting.","The United States has lagged behind the European Union in the past in oversight of tech companies and social media but Lowe noted “both the Android data leaks over the weekend and Cambridge Analytica news are forcing mechanisms on Congress to catch up with Europe on consumer privacy protections”.","In contrast to the United States, the European Union has had tougher regulations on tech companies and fined Google €2.4bn ($2.95bn) in 2017 for abusing its dominance in the search engine market to favor its own products.","Zuckerberg’s expected testimony, likely to take place in April, before the House energy and commerce committee marks the first time the Facebook founder will appear under oath to discuss the controversy.","The Senate judiciary committee and Senate commerce committee have also invited him to testify.","In 2017, Facebook spent over $11m on its lobbying effort in Washington, representing an increase of nearly $3m on its expenditures in 2016.

But for me the most consequential story of late was that a self-driving car operated by Uber — with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel — struck and tragically killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz.","I could only look at that deeply unsettling story and say: Welcome to the second inning — the second inning of one of the world’s great technological leaps, the implications of which we’re just beginning to understand.","But first, let’s acknowledge one thing: The first inning was amazing.","It was an inning full of promise, discovery and marvel. In the early 2000s, a set of technologies came together into platforms, social networks and software that made connectivity and solving complex problems fast, virtually free, easy for you, ubiquitous and invisible. Suddenly, more individuals could compete, connect, collaborate and create with more other people, in more ways, from more places, for less money and with greater ease than ever before. And we sure did!","We became our own filmmakers and reporters; we launched political and social revolutions from our living rooms; we connected with long-lost family and friends; we found the answers to old and new questions with one click; we searched for everything from spouses to news to directions to kindred spirits with our phones; we exposed dictators and branded ourselves. With one touch, we could suddenly call a taxi, direct a taxi, rate a taxi and pay a taxi — or rent an igloo, rate an igloo and pay for an igloo in Alaska.","And then, just as suddenly, we found ourselves in the second inning. The cool self-driving car killed a pedestrian; the cool Facebook platform enabled Russian troll farms to divide us and inject fake news into our public life; the uncool totalitarian government learned how to use the same facial recognition tools that can ease your way through passport control to single you out in a crowd for arrest.","And Mark Zuckerberg, who promised to connect us all — and that it would all be good — found himself on the cover of Wired magazine, with his face cut, bruised and bandaged, as if he’d been hit by a fastball. He wasn’t alone. In inning two, we started to feel beat up by the same platforms and technologies that had enriched, empowered and connected our lives.","Silicon Valley, we have a problem.","What to do? For problems like this, I like to consult my teacher and friend Dov Seidman, CEO of LRN, which helps companies and leaders build ethical cultures, and the author of the book, “How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything.”","“The first inning’s prevailing ethos was that any technology that makes the world more open by connecting us or makes us more equal by empowering us individually must, in and of itself, be a force for good,” Seidman began. “But, in inning two, we are coming to grips with the reality that the power to make the world more open and equal is not in the technologies themselves. It all depends on how the tools are designed and how we choose to use them. The same amazing tech that enables people to forge deeper relationships, foster closer communities and give everyone a voice can also breed isolation, embolden racists, and empower digital bullies and nefarious actors.”","Equally important, Seidman added, these “unprecedented and valuable tools of connection” are being used with great accuracy and potency “to assault the foundations of what makes our democracies vibrant, capitalism dynamic and our societies healthy — namely, truth and trust.”","And they have begun to be used “to assault our personal foundations — our privacy and sense of identity,” Seidman said: “It is one thing to use our data to enable better shopping experiences, but when my beliefs and attitudes are mined and manipulated for someone’s political campaign, a campaign that may be antithetical to my beliefs, that is deeply harmful and unmooring.” So what to do? “Precisely because we are in just the beginning of a technological revolution with a long, uncertain, up-and-down road ahead, we need to start by pausing to reflect on how our world, reshaped by these technologies, operates differently — and on the kind of values and leadership we will need to realize their promise.”","Values are more vital now than ever, Seidman insisted. “Because sustainable values are what anchor us in a storm, and because values propel and guide us when our lives are profoundly disrupted. They help us make the hard decisions.” Hard decisions abound, because everything is now connected. “The world is fused. So there no place anymore to stand to the side and claim neutrality — to say, ‘I am just a businessperson’ or ‘I am just running a platform.’ ”","No way. “Once you see that your technologies are having unintended consequences, you cannot maintain your neutrality — especially when you’ve become so central to the lives of billions of people.”","In the fused world, Seidman said, “the business of business is no longer just business. The business of business is now society. And, therefore, how you take or don’t take responsibility for what your technology enables or for what happens on your platforms is inescapable. This is the emerging expectation of users — real people — who’ve entrusted so much of their inner lives to these powerful companies.”","To be sure, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should all be commended for trying to find engineering solutions to prevent them from being hacked and weaponized.","“But this is not just an engineering problem, or just a business model problem,” he said. “Software solutions can increase our confidence that we can stay a step ahead of the bad guys. But, fundamentally, it will take more ‘moralware’ to regain our trust. Only one kind of leadership can respond to this kind of problem — moral leadership.”","What does moral leadership look like here?","“Moral leadership means truly putting people first and making whatever sacrifices that entails,” said Seidman. “That means not always competing on shallow things and quantity — on how much time people spend on your platform — but on quality and depth. It means seeing and treating people not just as ‘users’ or ‘clicks,’ but as ‘citizens,’ who are worthy of being accurately informed to make their best choices. It means not just trying to shift people from one click to another, from one video to another, but instead trying to elevate them in ways that deepen our connections and enrich our conversations.”","It means, Seidman continued, being “fully transparent about how you operate, and make decisions that affect them — all the ways in which you’re monetizing their data. It means having the courage to publish explicit standards of quality and expectations of conduct, and fighting to maintain them however inconvenient. It means having the humility to ask for help even from your critics. It means promoting civility and decency, making the opposite unwelcome. It means being truly bold — proclaiming, for example, that you will not sleep until you’re certain that our next democratic election won’t be hacked.”","At the height of the Cold War, when the world was threatened by spreading Communism and rising walls, President John F. Kennedy vowed to “pay any price and bear any burden” to ensure the success of liberty.","Today, falling walls and spreading webs — which criminals and nations can use to poison democratic societies — are becoming the biggest threat to the success of liberty. You will know that the good guys are winning when you see big tech companies rise to Kennedy’s challenge — to pay any price and bear any burden to protect us from the downsides of the technologies they’ve created."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Bannon also vigorously defended President Donald Trump’s track record, calling him “the greatest orator we’ve had since William Jennings Bryant.”","Bannon predicted that Trump will not hold a face to face meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, and he predicted that the role of the Chief of Staff in the White House will be replaced by a system “like there was in Trump Tower” in which five or six key lieutenants report directly to the President.","Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, said he was looking around for a possible next act in media but didn’t get specific. “A lot of people have been talking to me about different media things,” Bannon said. “This is a very difficult time in news.

But when pressed about his investment in Cambridge Analytica, Bannon pointed fingers in the other direction, including the use of Facebook data in 2008 by the Obama campaign.","“There’s a marketplace for your data — it’s being sold every day,” he said. He would not comment on his thoughts about Cambridge Analytia CEO Alexander Nix, and asserted that the issues in the spotlight at present were rooted in the activity of a related firm, SCL, based in Britain and “run by Brits.”","He said the focus on Cambridge Analytica and its work with the Trump campaign stems from the unwillingness of the political establishment to acknowledge that Trump won the election.","“The progressive left and opposition media cannot get over one basic fact: Donald J. Trump is President.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan's company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the newspaper said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","SUSPENDED FROM FACEBOOK","Facebook said on Friday it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and its parent group Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. http://bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica said GSR \"was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" he said.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" the spokesman said.","He said \"no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","\"We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,\" Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports \"important and powerful\" but said it was \"incorrect to call this a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\"","\"We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,\" he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","$6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it \"provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.\"","Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, declined to comment on Friday.","In past interviews with Reuters, he has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign, and that the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was \"more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West\" and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","The suspension means Cambridge Analytica and SCL cannot buy ads on the world's largest social media network or administer pages belonging to clients, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, said in a Twitter post.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses \"behavioral microtargeting,\" or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called \"research app\" that used Facebook's login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information \"in a legitimate way\" but \"he did not subsequently abide by our rules\" when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie.","Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan's app when it learned of the violation in 2015, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.","Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that \"not all data was deleted,\" prompting the suspension announced on Friday.","(Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom and Dustin Volz in Washington and Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru; Editing by Paul Simao and Bill Trott)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

From Facebook's description of the program:","With Partner Categories you can target people based on offline behaviors people take outside of Facebook, such as owning a home, being in the market for a new truck or being a loyal purchaser of a specific brand or product.","Facebook's Partner Categories offering was the result of a slew of data partnerships with companies such as Axiom and Oracle. These companies pull data from surveys, public records and store loyalty cards, among others.","This kind of ad targeting was useful, but doesn't make up the bulk of Facebook's ad business","While Partner Categories was useful to some brands, the majority of Facebook's advertisers' either employ Facebook's rich set of data on its users or their own data for ad targeting, according to ad buyers. Both of those targeting options are still available.","Generally speaking, Partner Categories appealed to big advertisers that don't have their own consumer data - like say packaged goods advertisers that primarily sell their products in stores, or car brands that sell via dealers.","Conversely, brands that sell directly to consumers - companies along the lines of Dollar Shave Club, Casper and Warby Parker - are less likely to need third-party data to run ad campaigns, since they collect their own data from their customers.","Also, it's important to note that while Facebook is taking away the option of using third-party data to target people with ads, marketers will still be able to use data from the Oracles of the world to measure the impact of campaigns.","In other words, a toothpaste brand will no longer be able to use third-party data to send ads to people who are frequent supermarket shoppers. But they will still be able to use data from these third parties to track whether ads on Facebook resulted in people buying their products in stores.","So this move is unlikely to cause Facebook's revenue to plunge overnight.

The “Facebook Container,” as the new extension is called, isolates your Facebook identity from the rest of the web. That means Facebook will not be able to use your other web activity to send your targeted advertising.","To be clear, this extension wouldn’t have saved users’ data from being compromised as it was in the Cambridge Analytica scandal; and it does nothing to prevent Facebook advertisers from diving into your profile and your activity while on the social network in order to target you with advertisements while browsing Facebook.","However, it is meant to plug at least one of the holes in Facebook’s leaky dam by offering a way for users to prevent Facebook from gaining even more data collected outside its service.","“Containers are a feature built into the Firefox platform that separate user cookies and site data into different cookie jars,” explains Jeff Griffiths, Product Lead for Firefox. “For Facebook Container specifically, this means that a user should only be able to log in in the Facebook Container. Facebook cookies and site data that identify the user are only available to that Container, and only Facebook can be open in that Container,” he says.","When you install the new extension, it deletes your Facebook cookies and logs you out of the social network. The next time you open Facebook, you’ll notice it’s been opened in a blue-colored “container” tab.","From within that tab, you can continue to use Facebook normally. However, if you click a link that would take you to a page off of Facebook, it will load the URL outside the container. Similarly, if you click any Facebook Share buttons outside of Facebook, it will load those in the Facebook container. (But this will send information to Facebook about the website you shared them from, it should be noted.)","In addition, you may not be able to login to third-party apps with your Facebook credentials, and the embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons you see around the web won’t work either.","“This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity,” explains The Firefox Frontier blog. “So it may look different than what you are used to seeing.”","Actually, it may surprise you to find out how widespread your use of Facebook was when outside the social network.","Facebook’s platform and its off-site advertising network allow other sites and apps to access users’ Facebook data even when users aren’t on Facebook itself. Facebook is hardly alone in terms of companies doing this. But it is making headlines over data mishandling, which means it’s a good time for Mozilla to capitalize on consumers’ concerns to share their messages – and tools – focused on data privacy.","Mozilla said it sped up its work on the Facebook Container add-on, which is based on technology it’s been developing over the past couple of years, as it’s seen increasing consumer demand for tools for managing privacy and security.","There are other tools available to help consumers with these issues today, as well, including the Ghostery anti-tracking extension now owned by Cliqz, ad blockers (including those bundled with browsers like Safari), and more.","However, single-purpose tools like this are useful because they allow people to limit some data-sharing activity, without having to take the drastic step of deleting Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Data dump Facebook supplied as all at country level summaries and didn’t have any PIDs; Personal Identifiers","3. The initial research by Kogan et al recruited participants in the US via Amazon Mechanical Turk for $1, yes thats $1!","“We recruited 1069 individuals from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk who lived in the United States to participate in the study in exchange for $1.00. At the beginning of the study, participants completed a consent form which detailed all parts of the study. No deception was used. Of these individuals, 857 participants consented to authorizing our Facebook app to gather some information from their profiles automatically. This information included their total number of friends and their friends’ current location — we note that friend location data was not available for all friends, but it was available for the majority of friends. Facebook researchers were not directly involved in Study 1 — the data collection was done independently through the Cambridge team’s own app. We focused only on the participants who had at least one Facebook friend (sample N = 815). These participants had on average 353 friends, and all together had 287,739 friends”","4. Research was funded by ESRC (UK) and St Petersburg State University (yup thats Russian money) and domiciled at Cambridge (university)","5. No IP seems to have been filed for this, at least from a quick Google patent search, however the techniques are not novel, pretty standard and rudimentary, the findings are somewhat novel","So in an nutshell, this is more than just about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica ethics notwithstanding but more on how public funds from the UK and Russia resulted in some technology being developed and domiciled at Cambridge (university) and how it got into the hands of alt-right folks (read Mercer, Bannon et al) to shift the narrative in the worlds most powerful democracy and manufacture consent for a relatively unpopular candidate.","On the flip side, the data and technology is generally available to pretty much everyone apart from explicit data from platforms and vendors, which in the US is easy to come by at a price. So both the right and left have access to the same tools and resources, its more on how they effectively organise themselves thats wins elections.","Obama used similar tactics for voter inclusion, Trump used it for voter exclusion. So more than technical issues, its more so a politics, policy and law issue. Modern day policy, politics and political theory is simply outdated and has not developed fast enough to keep up with societal changes which happen to be influenced heavily by technology changes."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Because I know that they could have prevented it.’\nPhotograph: Robert Gumpert","Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.","Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.","Where's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds","Read more","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.","Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Damian Collins, a British lawmaker, said Sunday that Zuckerberg or another senior executive should appear in front of his committee because previous witnesses have avoided difficult questions, creating “a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.’’","The next few weeks represent a critical time for Facebook to reassure users and regulators about its content standards and platform security, to prevent rules that could impact its main advertising business, according to Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights.","“Changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,’’ Ives wrote in a note to investors.","Facebook, meanwhile, has sought to explain that the mishandling of user data was out of its hands and doesn’t constitute a “breach” – a definition that would require the company to alert users about whether their information was taken, per U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules.","Menlo Park, California-based Facebook no longer allows app developers to ask for access to data on users’ friends. But the improper handling of the data raises systemic questions about how much companies can be trusted to protect personal information, said Nuala O’Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology.","“While the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways,’’ O’Connor said in a statement. “Communications technologies have become an essential part of our daily lives, but if we are unable to have control of our data, these technologies control us. For our democracy to thrive, this cannot continue.’’"],"isopubdate":""}

Uncertainty\nmakes people nervous about federated login.","but unfortunately I think Tim’s missed a reasonable proportion of the\npoint here. You see, there are two questions asked there:","When I log in to GreatNewApp with my Google identity, what does\nGreatNewApp learn about my Google identity and what can they do with\nthat information?, and","When I log in to GreatNewApp with my Google identity, what do\nGoogle learn about me and what can they do with that information?","and Tim then goes on to only treat the first of those questions. I think\nthat the second question is a big part of the reason why people are\n“nervous about federated login”.","When you sign in to an app with Google, you see, as Tim notes, a thing\nshowing you what the app can know about your Google identity.

I asked why, and she said “because then Facebook\nposts on your wall that you’re using that app and I don’t want it to”.\nIt’s similar with other people; as far as I can tell, the biggest worry\nis not that GreatNewApp might do something weird with your Google\ninformation, it’s that Google will do something weird with it.","Perhaps that dialog should look like this.","It’s not about what the RP (that is: GreatNewApp) can do with your\ninformation, Tim. That’s important, but it’s already taken care of;\neveryone involved in federated identity in any way spends all their time\nworrying about that. In talking to people, the biggest example of this\nis “sign in with Twitter”; if you sign in to an app with Twitter and\nTwitter displays “this app can read your direct messages” and “this app\ncan tweet as you”, everyone’s justifiably worried: this thing is going\nto spam my friends with messages about itself! I don’t want that! And\nthat’s correct. The existing federated systems deal with this problem —\nwith the issue of apps doing things to your Google or Twitter or\nFacebook account — quite well.

His LinkedIn shows that he is a business-development staffer at Palantir in London. He suggested that Cambridge Analytica create a personality-quiz app to harvest data from Facebook users, The Times said. Cambridge Analytica eventually used a similar method to obtain data from about 50 million Facebook users it could then sell.","LinkedIn","The connection between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica was apparently suggested by Schmidt’s daughter Sophie, who had been an intern at SCL Group, a UK-based defence and intelligence contractor that created Cambridge Analytica in 2012. A 2013 email seen by The Times indicated that Sophie Schmidt, who did not respond to the paper’s request for comment, urged that SCL work with Palantir:","“Ever come across Palantir. Amusingly Eric Schmidt’s daughter was an intern with us and is trying to push us towards them?” one SCL employee wrote to a colleague in the email.","Cambridge Analytica and Palantir began their relationship in 2014, when Christopher Wylie, the pink-haired Cambridge Analytica cofounder turned whistleblower who testified to Parliament in London this week, visited Palantir’s London headquarters in Soho Square with Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix. The Times said:","“Mr. Chmieliauskas continued to communicate with Mr. Wylie’s team in 2014, as the Cambridge employees were locked in protracted negotiations with a researcher at Cambridge University, Michal Kosinski, to obtain Facebook data through an app Mr. Kosinski had built. The data was crucial to efficiently scale up Cambridge’s psychometrics products so they could be used in elections and for corporate clients.","“‘I had left field idea,’ Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote in May 2014. ‘What about replicating the work of the cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to facebook?’ Reproducing the app, Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote, ‘could be a valuable leverage negotiating with the guy.'”","Nix later tried to work officially with executives at Palantir, but they demurred. Ultimately, Cambridge Analytica pursued the app without Palantir’s official help.","The emails will make uncomfortable reading for both companies.","Thiel is a Facebook board member and a conservative libertarian with a dystopian view of the future who funded Donald Trump’s US presidential campaign.

Trump’s presidential campaign, harvested data from 50 million Facebook users, raised the current uproar, even if the origins lie as far back as the 2016 election. It has been many months of allegations and arguments that the internet in general and social media in particular are pulling society down instead of lifting it up.","That has inspired a good deal of debate about more restrictive futures for Facebook and Google.

This past week, Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook, saying the social network’s default privacy settings allowed access to too much data.","The greatest likelihood is that the internet companies, frightened by the tumult, will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency. And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill.","The next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe, where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising.","The Cambridge Analytica case, said Vera Jourova, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, was not just a breach of private data. “This is much more serious, because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality,” she said.","Although many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw, the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery.","Consumers’ seemingly benign activities — their likes — could be used to covertly categorize and influence their behavior. And not just by unknown third parties. Facebook itself has worked directly with presidential campaigns on ad targeting, describing its services in a company case study as “influencing voters.”","“People are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters,” said Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. “If your personal information can help sway elections, which affects everyone’s life and societal well-being, maybe privacy does matter after all.”","In interviews, Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, seemed to accept the possibility of increased privacy regulation, something that would have been unlikely only a few months ago. But some trade group executives also warned that any attempt to curb the use of consumer data would put the business model of the ad-supported internet at risk.","Image","Facebook has worked directly with presidential campaigns on ad targeting, once describing its services as “influencing voters.”","“You’re undermining a fundamental concept in advertising: reaching consumers who are interested in a particular product,” said Dean C. Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group in Washington whose members include Amazon, Facebook, Google and Twitter.","If suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States, it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo, the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War.","“We’re at an inflection point, when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm,” said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. “This is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers, and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances.”","In May, the European Union is instituting a comprehensive new privacy law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. The new rules treat personal data as proprietary, owned by an individual, and any use of that data must be accompanied by permission — opting in rather than opting out — after receiving a request written in clear language, not legalese.","Mélanie Voin, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive. For example, a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue.","Image","Users detailed their interests and obsessions on Facebook and Google, generating a river of data that could be collected and harnessed for advertising.CreditSergio Perez/Reuters","In a January speech in Brussels, Facebook’s Ms. Sandberg said, “We know we can’t just meet the G.D.P.R., but we need to do even more.” Google declined to comment.","The United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation. But after years of pushing for similar legislation, privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum — and they were looking to Europe for inspiration.","“With the new European law, regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools,” said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington. “We now have a way to hold these companies accountable.”","But any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry.","Privacy advocates and even some United States regulators have long been concerned about the ability of online services to track consumers and make inferences about their financial status, health concerns and other intimate details to show them behavior-based ads. They warned that such microtargeting could unfairly categorize or exclude certain people.","Industry groups successfully argued that collecting personal details posed no harm to consumers and that efforts to hinder data collection would chill innovation. Instead, the advertising industry created a program to allow consumers to opt out of having their data used for customized ads, although it does not allow people to entirely opt out of having their data collected.","“If it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual-company failure, then there’s a case to be made for federal regulation” under certain circumstances, said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group.","The business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two. Nor did people flee for other services. That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue.","If the current furor dies down without meaningful change, critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched. When the tech industry follows its natural impulses, it becomes even less transparent.","That would hamper any long-term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views, an urgent question in Germany, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the United States and many other places.","“To know the real interaction between populism and Facebook, you need to give much more access to researchers, not less,” said Paul-Jasper Dittrich, a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute.","There’s another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing. It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion. The technology world’s remedy for any problem is always more technology.","“If Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits, we could regulate them,” said Maciej Ceglowski, who runs Tech Solidarity, a labor advocacy group. “But well-intentioned people can break things not easy to fix.

Does that make it evil?","text":["You bet, says Sean Parker, who made a fortune as an early Facebook investor and its first president. In an interview with Axios’ Mike Allen this week, Parker said that he has become something of a “conscientious objector” to social media. And he reflected with some regret on his own role in helping to mold the sort of company that Facebook would become.","Advertisement","“The thought process was all about, ‘How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?’,” he said. “And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever, and that’s going to get you to contribute more content, and that’s going to get you more likes and comments. It’s a social validation feedback loop. … You’re exploiting a vulnerabilty in human psychology.”","Parker went on: “I think the inventors, creators—it’s me, it’s Mark [Zuckerberg], it’s Kevin Systrom at Instagram, it’s all of these people—understood this, consciously. And we did it anyway.”","There’s a weird element of humblebrag in Parker’s comments: He seems to be claiming more credit for Facebook creation than he probably deserves, given that his stint at the company lasted only a year. And we should probably take with a grain of salt any sweeping assessment of Facebook based on the personal experience of a guy who hasn’t worked there in 12 years. (The news feed hadn’t even been invented yet when he left following his arrest on suspicion of cocaine possession, for which he was never charged.)","They also raise a deeper question: Is it wrong to build products with the goal of making them addictive? And if so, does that make social media companies that optimize for things like “time spent” and “engagement,” well, evil?","Is it wrong to build products with the goal of making them addictive?","It’s not a new question, obviously. But it’s one that some in Silicon Valley seem to be taking more seriously in the wake of widespread disillusionment over social media’s role in politics and civil discourse. I wrote last week about how Zuckerberg has taken up the phrase “time well spent”—as opposed to just “time spent”—as a new way to articulate the platform’s ostensibly benevolent goals. (The technology critic who popularized that phrase, former Google ethicist Tristan Harris, found Zuckerberg’s use of it to be disingenuous.)","At the same time that Facebook was taking flak from Parker for its addictive qualities, another Silicon Valley startup was provoking similar criticisms. TechCrunch this week profiled a companyfounded by a neuropsychologist and a neuroeconomist with the goal of using machine learning to make other companies’ apps more, well, addictive. The startup’s name, aptly enough: Dopamine Labs. (It was also featured in an April episode of CBS’ 60 Minutes on the theme of “brain hacking.”)","Per TechCrunch’s story, Dopamine Labs has built a software program called Skinner—yes, it’s named after the behaviorist psychologist B.F. Skinner—that monitors an app’s various prompts and notifications and how users respond to them. The goal is to help companies tweak those features to make them maximally sticky. The company claims its service can add an average of 10 percent to the revenues of the startups that use it. “If all of that sounds creepy,” writes TechCrunch’s Jonathan Shieber, “don’t worry, it is.”","Advertisement","To counteract the effects of its primary business on users—and perhaps on its own creators’ conscience—Dopamine also offers an app called Space that helps people manage their notifications and the time they spend online.","screen grab","Predictably, the coverage has generated some backlash. A post about it on the tech bulletin board Hacker News drew the following top comment from user “013a:”","This organization is disgusting and is evidence enough that our industry has no sense of ethical responsibility. When massive regulation lands on Silicon Valley and we whine about the impact it has on innovation, remember companies like Dopamine Labs who truly deserved it.","François Chollet, a Google engineer who’s well-known in the A.I. community, reprimanded the company on Twitter:","Dopamine, an \"AI platform\" to engineer addictiveness. Saddest thing I've read about today. If you work in AI, you have de facto some power over others, so remember to always exercise this power responsibly. https://t.co/tcT7t1QETc","It’s true that Dopamine is unusually blunt about what it’s doing. But are its means or ends really much different than those of Facebook, Snapchat, Zynga, or any number of other companies who make their money by getting people hooked on their apps?","T. Dalton Combs, one of the company’s co-founders, doesn’t think so. “I think a lot of people in the technology industry are very sensitive to talking plainly about these issues, because everyone I think has a lot of anxiety and guilt about them,” he told me in a phone interview. “And so when someone stands up like Sean Parker did, or like Dopamine does, and talks plainly about these techniques and their benefits and their costs, everyone kind of freaks out. I mean, we know these kinds of technologies are why Google’s free and Facebook’s free, and why everyone in tech is able to make the salaries they do. But they scare us.”","Combs added that the company views its role as trying to democratize the user-retention techniques that big social media and gaming companies have already mastered, so that smaller apps and startups—including some focused on self-improvement and social causes—can compete on a more level playing field. Put another way: Unicorns shouldn’t be the only ones that can afford to be an attention vortex.","We should be careful about conflating “addictive” apps or games with more destructive forms of addiction.","“Our goal isn’t more screen time for people,” he says. “What we’re trying to point out is that these technologies for changing people’s behavior can be used in a lot of ways. So far it’s mostly social media companies, companies with ad models, using them to increase on-platform time. But they can also be used to help you take your medication on time. Or get to the gym on a regular schedule. Or finish the online courses you’re taking.” He acknowledged that Dopamine doesn’t limit its clients to companies focused on social good, but he said it does turn away clients whose apps involve gambling or other “user-toxic” activities.","Advertisement","It’s easy to moralize about companies making their products addictive on purpose. And it really is refreshing when you hear of someone like Dong Nguyen, the Vietnamese game designer who pulled his viral hit Flappy Birdfrom app stores out of concern for its users’ time and well-being.","But we should be careful about conflating “addictive” apps or games with more destructive forms of addiction, such as substance abuse. Lots of activities can be addictive, colloquially speaking, without substantially impacting the players’ relationships, career, or physical health. While they may be analogous in certain respects, there’s plenty of moral daylight between running a tobacco company and designing a harmless app in a way that keeps people checking in a few times each day. That’s why a lot of mental health experts don’t consider “smartphone addiction” to be a useful medical diagnosis.","It’s useful to know that Facebook was focused almost from its inception on hooking users and getting them to spend lots of time on it—and that there are lots of other companies today employing similar techniques, sometimes with the aid of neuropsychological research. We should all be more aware that companies are using our own psychological vulnerabilities against us because it helps us to be on our guard against overuse. But it’s unrealistic, in our current capitalist environment, to expect Internet companies not to be working hard to insinuate their products into our lives in one way or another. That, for better or worse, is simply the prevailing business model for online media. And with free services that sell us to advertisers as their real product, it is part of the bargain we have so far accepted.","So where does that leave us? Back where we started, essentially: Whether Facebook or any other app is good or bad for us doesn’t just depend on how much we use it, but on how we use it—and what that usage does to us, both individually and as a society. Being addictive, in other words, doesn’t make a company’s products evil: Being evil makes them evil."],"isopubdate":""}

Over the weekend, Android owners were displeased to discover that Facebook had been scraping their text-message and phone-call metadata, in some cases for years, an operation hidden in the fine print of a user agreement clause until Ars Technica reported. Facebook was quick to defend the practice as entirely aboveboard—small comfort to those who are beginning to realize that, because Facebook is a free service, they and their data are by necessity the products.","In its current iteration, Facebook’s Messenger application requests that those who download it give it permission to access incoming and outgoing call and text logs. But, as users discovered when prompted to download a copy of their personal data before permanently deleting their Facebook accounts, a certain amount of data was covertly siphoned without explicit permissions. Buried inside those data caches was an unsettling amount of specific, detailed information—in some cases, every phone call or text message ever sent or received on their Android device. Dylan McKay, who apparently owns an Android phone, reported that for the period between November 2016 and July 2017, his archives contained “the metadata of every cellular call I’ve ever made, including time and duration” and “metadata about every text message I’ve ever received or sent.” When people like McKay agreed to share their contacts with Facebook, it appears they didn’t know the extent to which they were giving Facebook access to their personal information.","Facebook responded with a blog post laying out the applicable user-agreement terms and denying that Facebook collects call or SMS data surreptitiously. “Contact uploading is optional. People are expressly asked if they want to give permission to upload their contacts from their phone—it’s explained right there in the apps when you get started,” the company said in a statement to the Guardian. “People can delete previously uploaded information at any time and can find all the information available to them in their account and activity log from our Download Your Information tool.”","But the revelation couldn’t have come at a worse time for Facebook, which is trying—and failing—to dig itself out from under the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. On Sunday, the company released a full-page print advertisement in the U.K.’s The Observer,The Sunday Times,Mail on Sunday,Sunday Mirror,Sunday Express, and the Sunday Telegraph, along with American newspapers The New York Times,The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal, in an attempt to regain public trust. In the ad, Zuckerberg called the Cambridge Analytica leak a “breach of trust” and apologized, reassuring readers that “we’re now taking steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again,” but so far it seems to have missed the mark. According to a poll from SurveyMonkey and Axios published on Monday, Facebook’s already-low favorability rating has dropped twice as much as that of other tech giants from October 2017 to March 2018."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

One of the contracts ended just last month.","On Tuesday, Heather Nauert, a State Department spokesperson confirmed that SCL held a recent contract worth almost $500,000 with the State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC), which was set up in 2016 in order to \"counter propaganda and disinformation from international terrorist organisations and foreign countries\".","The GEC's work has included advising scholars on condensing fatwas into tweets, and using Facebook to target counter-extremist content at millions of Muslims in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe.","\"The portfolio that they have handled for us is the deradicalisation, essentially, of people who would be interested in joining ISIS,\" said Nauert.","The company, she said, had undertaken similar work previously for the State Department, as well as for other governments.","\"I know that many other governments work with them as well.

The GEC had asked for a budget of $21mn in 2017 and $60m for 2018, he said.","\"I mean as a comparison, in the UK for example the agency that deals with online counter messaging and anti-terrorist activities is funded at $8mn. So that is just a relative comparison. It seems like we are seriously under funding this effort,\" he said.","A current job advert for the UK government's Research, Communications and Information Unit (RICU), which is responsible for counter-terrorism and counter-extremism messaging, revealed that it now has a budget of £40mn ($56mn) and employs about 70 staff. That compares with £4.25mn and 22 staff in 2011.","'Project DUCO'","The UK government describes itself as \"leading international efforts to counter Daesh's propaganda and damage its brand,\", and it works closely with the US as part of the global coalition against IS.","The US, the UK and the UAE serve as co-chairs on the Counter-Daesh Coalition Communications Cell, which is funded by and based in the British foreign office in London.","A UK government website says: \"Through the UK's leadership, the Cell has changed the international narrative around Daesh – from one that highlights their atrocities to one which emphasises their failures. This has been vital in damaging the perception of Daesh and reducing their ability to recruit.\"","According to the coalition's website, the communication cell's work has included sharing \"best practices in online anti-Daesh engagement with partner governments, including consultations with Facebook about extremists' use of social media\".","It will come as no surprise that a significant aspect of [SCL's] work was within the burgeoning field of counter-extremism, where surveillance, deception and propaganda have been considered acceptable techniques over the last decade and funded with multi-million dollar budgets","- Arun Kundnani","The Ministry of Defence told MEE on Friday that it had signed four past contracts for data analyics with SCL and an SCL subsidiary since 2009.","They consisted of two contracts worth £125,000 (now $177,000) and £30,000 ($43,000) in 2009-10, and a contract worth £150,000 ($212,000) signed in 2014-15. The Ministry of Defence also signed a contract with SCL Insight worth £42,000 ($60,000) in December 2017 for a project which finished last month.","A Freedom of Information request, published by the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), appears to show that SCL was also contracted by the Ministry of Defence in 2013 to carry out a pilot study codenamed Project DUCO.","The goal was to test the use of Target Audience Analysis, a research methodology promoted by SCL, to \"identify emerging groups, the motivations behind their formation and their likely behaviours in a given context,\" according to a heavily redacted evaluation carried out by DSTL.","The study focused on \"Young Unmarried Males\" (YUMs), who were seen as a critical target audience. The field work was carried out in a country in which the security situation was so bad that preparatory work for the study was done using Google Earth imagery.","'Big data tools'","A senior figure at SCL is also linked to an infamous counter-insurgency communications campaign run for the US Army by British PR firm Bell Pottinger during the occupation of Iraq, which included the production of fake al-Qaeda videos.","Between 2004 and 2012, Mark Turnbull, the current managing director of SCL Elections, managed Bell Pottinger's Specialist Unit in Conflict Transformation, according to his LinkedIn page.","His work included \"a three year campaign of popular resistance to violent extremism through an indigenous 'grass roots' social movement, deploying multi-media and activist networks,\" and a \"four year multi-media regional counter-radicalisation campaign across 22 countries addressing the psycho-social drivers of violent extremism,\" the profile said.","Turnbull last year spoke at a Foreign Office conference on \"Diplomacy in the Information Age,\" advising officials on lessons to be learnt from Donald Trump's election campaign.","A report of the event said that the key points discussed included \"exploring the benefits of big data tools\" and \"thinking through the ethical, legal and presentational questions around big data and social media exploitation\".","SCL has also worked closely with Steve Tatham, a former commander of a British military psychological operations brigade who served in Afghanistan and Iraq.","Tatham, who runs a military and security consultancy firm, said in a statement posted earlier this week: \"We have previously worked, as contractors, for the defence division of SCL. We are utterly appalled at the actions of senior Cambridge Analytica staff. These are not our values and standards and we condemn them unreservedly.\"","Arun Kundnani, the co-author of a report published this week on the globalisation of counter-extremism policies, told MEE that counter-extremism work based on the manipulation of data and subterfuge posed a threat to human rights and democracy.","Damaging democracy","\"It will come as no surprise that a significant aspect of [SCL’s] work was within the burgeoning field of counter-extremism, where surveillance, deception and propaganda have been considered acceptable techniques over the last decade and funded with multi-million-dollar budgets.","\"The UK government considers itself a world leader in this field and has trumpeted its approach across the world, inspiring similar counter-extremism programmes across the EU, at the US State Department, and in the Gulf states.","\"These kinds of government manipulation of data, carried out in the name of countering extremism, represent a substantial, and often overlooked, threat to the human rights of Muslims. In the end, they damage democracy itself and therefore should be alarming to all of us.\"","The UK government on Wednesday disclosed three past contracts with SCL: a training project for the Home Office in 2009, a communications project for the Foreign Office, and the data project with the Ministry of Defence in 2014-15.","A Home Office spokesperson told MEE: \"The Home Office holds no current contracts with SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica or any of its parent companies.","\"The department made a one-off payment of £500 to the SCL Group in 2009 for a training course. This was many years before the recent revelations and before the formal investigation into the use of personal data.\"","A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \"We have no current contracts with SCL Group, which includes Cambridge Analytica. As such, the company has no access to any classified information.\"","The spokesperson said that past MOD contracts with SCL had not involved the use of Facebook data.","The Foreign Office had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.","David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and the editor of Powerbase, a website that describes itself as \"a guide to networks of power, lobbying and deceptive PR,\" told MEE it was hard to get a true picture of the extent of SCL's activities because of its use of shell companies, some of them based in offshore locations.","\"They clearly have become connected with people with a considerable amount of resources. Both the military and the government on one side and elements of the alt-right on the other,\" said Miller.","MEE contacted SCL for comment with queries related to this story but was sent a statement issued by Alexander Tayler, Cambridge Analytica's acting chief executive.","Tayler said: \"As a data scientist I deeply believe in fairness and transparency in the way data is collected and processed. I am sorry that in 2014 SCL Elections (an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica) licensed Facebook data and derivatives from a research company that had not received consent from most respondents. The company believed that the data had been obtained in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws.\"","Tayler also said the company had deleted all the Facebook data and had not used it during the 2016 US presidential election.","Investigators working for the Information Commissioner's Office, the UK's data watchdog that has focused on Cambridge Analytica's work as part of an inquiry into data analytics for political purposes, on Friday searched the company's London headquarters after obtaining a court order to examine databases and servers.","\"As anyone who is familiar with our staff and work can testify, we in no way resemble the politically motivated and unethical company that some have sought to portray.\"","On its website SCL highlights its expertise in \"counter radicalisation and recruitment\".","\"SCL employs social science models to understand how radical messages are appealing and uses powerful counter narrative strategies to neutralise misinformation,\" it says.","\"SCL has an impressive history of reducing radical recruitment over the last decade and is currently supporting this effort for elements of the US government.\""],"isopubdate":""}

Blackwater worked for the US as a “contracted” private army (there were as many as 160,000 contracted personnel operating during the Iraq war). Blackwater guards worked outside the normal military command of the military and the House Oversight Committee would later reveal the firm was engaged in over 195 unprovoked attacks in a 9 month period in 2014.","As a result of the Nisour Square massacre, Iraq terminated Blackwater’s license to operate within its borders. Four Blackwater employees were tried and convicted in U.S. federal court; one for murder, and the other three of manslaughter and firearms charges.","Peter Singer, a former Brookings Analyst would later write, “When we evaluate the facts, the use of private military contractors appears to have harmed, rather than helped, the counterinsurgency efforts of the U.S. mission in Iraq, going against our best doctrine and undermining critical efforts of our troops.”","Mercenary Erik Prince wants to command a private army to fight the war in Afghanistan.","10 years after the Nisour Square Massacre, Blackwater CEO Erik Prince, the same man who helmed the company in 2007, is proposing that a private army should fight another U.S. war in Afghanistan.","Prince, brother of Education Secretary Betsy Devos, is a staunch supporter of the Trump administration with close ties to Vice President Mike Pence, Trump backers Robert and Rebekah Mercer and former White House strategist Stephen Bannon. Prince, as you may recall, was the Trump adviser who held secret talks with Russia in the Seychelles in December 2016. Now, he wants to privatize the 16- year-old war in Afghanistan.","“We aren’t winning,” President Trump recently chastised his Generals at a meeting on Afghanistan. “We are losing.” The Generals reminded the President that the U.S. isn’t winning the war because he’d delayed signing off on a strategy for months. It’s in that vacuum that Prince and the White House have floated an idea to pay Blackwater $10 billion to hire 5,500 private contractors to run the war in Afghanistan.","Prince is not the only private citizen to set to benefit from this deployment. Silicon Valley mogul Peter Thiel, who helped found PayPal and Facebook donated $1.25 million to Trump’s campaign and was even given an important prime-time speaking role at the Republican National Convention in July 2016. He is close to Erik Prince. Thiel showed New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, “a picture on his phone of him posing with Erik Prince, who founded the private military company Blackwater, and Mr. Trump but joke[d] that it was ’N.S.F.I.’ (Not Safe for the Internet).”","Thiel is the co-founder of Palantir, a controversial yet effective data mining software company which provides clients, including many branches of the U.S. military, a real-time view of what is going on in an operational theatre (weather conditions, cell-phone and social media tracking, and other real-time data). Palantir’s software is believed to have been used in the raid that killed Osama Bin-Laden and has been effectively deployed elsewhere.","Critics say Palantir doesn’t have the right security and privacy mechanisms and as a private company, the vast data set that it owns, often classified, is in the hands of a private company and can easily pass into the wrong hands. The system has has also been vulnerable to significant malware attacks.","Former National Security Adviser, Lt-General Michael Flynn, supported adoption of the Palantir platform. He was later exposed as being compromised by Russian intelligence.","Former National Security Adviser, Lt-Gen Michael Flynn, exposed as “compromised” by Russia, has ties to mercenary Erik Prince and Peter Thiel’s company Palantir.","Palantir has many supporters in the military ranks, including three of General Jim Mattis’ deputies who have lobbied on behalf of Thiel’s company. Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet advise the company. Perhaps Palantir’s most ardent supporter is Lt-General Michael Flynn, Trump’s former National Security adviser, who was working for Turkey and who Justice officials say was compromised by the Russians. Back in 2010, when he was the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn pushed the military to adopt Palantir software. “Intelligence analysts in theater currently do not have the tools required to fully analyze the tremendous amounts of information currently available,” Flynn wrote.","Flynn also played a behind the scenes role connecting Palantir to partners. Steven Brill speculates in Fortune magazine that with Trump in office, Thiel can get Palantir approval across U.S. agencies, something his key lobbyist (and compromised Russian operative) Michael Flynn would wholeheartedly endorse.","Flynn served under Mike Pence as the vice chairman of Trump’s transition team. In December, he met with Russian Ambassador Kislyak. The same month Flynn, Erik Prince, Jared Kushner and Stephen Bannon met Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan in a secret meeting in New York. Zayed had met with Putin twice in 2016. A few weeks after the New York meeting, Zayed arranged for Erik Prince to meet a representative of Vladimir Putin in the Seychelles in order to explore Russia’s willingness to isolate Iran in exchange for closer U.S. relations and dropping of sanctions.","Another top Trump supporter Stephen A. Feinberg is working with Prince to support the privatization of the war in Afghanistan. Feinberg is the billionaire financier who owns the giant military contractor DynCorp International. Bannon and Kushner tapped Prince and Feinberg to come up with the plan to privatize the conflict in Afghanistan. Feinberg is also close to Thiel.","Russia’s global strategy is to gain access to warm water ports. They supply weapons to the Taliban to fight the Afghanistan army which is supported by the U.S.","Russia supplies weapons to the Taliban while working with the Trump administration to co-operate in the fight against it.","Afghanistan has been a quagmire for the United States for 16 years, and part of the reason it is bogged down there is Russia. The head of U.S. forces there, Gen. John Nicholson confirmed Moscow is supplying weapons to the Taliban. “We continue to get reports of this assistance,” Nicholson said, speaking to reporters alongside Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. “We support anyone who wants to help us advance the reconciliation process, but anyone who arms belligerents who perpetuate attacks like the one we saw two days ago in Mazar-e Sharif is not the best way forward to a peaceful reconciliation.”","It’s easy to see why Russia has a strategic goal in Afghanistan. Russia’s foreign policy is guided by a drive to access warm water ports. This is true in Syria, North Korea, Turkey, Iran and the “stan” countries – particularly Afghanistan and Pakistan. In addition to the efforts to prop up the Taliban, Russia has supported ISIS, Hezbollah through Iran and despots like Bashar al-Assad.","Putin likes to wage war between two forces he controls so any move by the Trump administration to “privatize” the war in Afghanistan should be viewed in this light. Without real U.S. military involvement, a private army run by Erik Prince and cooperation from Russia in taming the Taliban it supports, joint Russian and U.S. control over Afghanistan would bring a cold peace to the region, but it also gives Russia a strategic foothold at the expense of the U.S. It would certainly enrich three of Trump’s biggest supporters: Erik Prince, Peter Thiel and Stephen Feinberg."],"isopubdate":"2017-08-18"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said.","He said “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is seen at the Facebook Gather conference in Brussels, Belgium January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo","$6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica.","“Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign.","He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Related Coverage","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information “in a legitimate way” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie.","Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan’s app when it learned of the violation, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.","Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that “not all data was deleted.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Alfie was suffering from epilepsy, or constant, chronic seizures.","Alfie was born healthy and on time. He was discharged after 3 days and from there our wait was over. We finally had him with us going home, our beautiful boy. This was a day we looked forward to for 9 months. He grew and fed well, but didn't meet milestones. Alfie was a very sleepy baby who loved his sleep and when he was awake he was an agitated baby.","After a couple of weeks we noticed he wasn't doing things he should e.g lifting his head up,looking at us for more than 20 seconds,grabbing his dummy,eating his hands,making gaga noises,etc. We also noticed he was doing a jerking movement with his hands, arms and legs and eyes would roll up. He always had his hands clenched into a fist too. He just didn't do what he should of been doing so Kate took him the doctors, overall three times, and doctors said he was lazy and a late developer.Months went by and Alfie went backward instead of forwards. He started making more jerking movement and wasn't himself at all! This went on until Alfie got a chest infection. The infection led him to have a myoclonic jerking spasm.","This is when he was first put on life support. They told us in the new year that Alfie wasn't going to make it so we had him christened. We thought we were going to lose our son!But Alfie had other ideas, he managed to beat the infection and start breathing on his own. He came off the vent in March and was on cpap. He was moving and trying to open his eyes!","Unfortunately back in december 2017 AH decided that they did not want to treat Alfie anymore and took us to court. After a lengthy 3 month battle were we tried to appeal to the highest courts even the POPE got involved they decided to turn Alfies machine off against our wishes saying he would die within minutes.","Alfie fought on like a true brave warrior for 5 days and gained his wings on 28/04/2018 and left us totally shattered.","We dont want any other family going through what we have so we are hoping to use this money to open a foundation to help other families of UNDIAGNOSED and ILL children to get the help they need.","Great people make things happen","About the fundraiser","Sarah Evans","Liverpool, United Kingdom","Alfie is our amazing son whom lost his battle 5 days after getting his life support machine turned off after a lengthy court battle to Keep him alive.\nWe are Alfie's voice and will continue to search for answers for future families going through what we did."],"isopubdate":"2018-06-22"}

It’s alleged the details of Facebook users were harvested, and used to influence the 2016 US Presidential election.","The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) Select Committee, headed by MP Damian Collins, has written a letter to Zuckerberg requesting an oral testimony to be given in person.","The letter read: “The Committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent. Your officials’ answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the Committee.","“It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process. There is a strong public interest test regarding user protection. Accordingly we are sure you will understand the need for a representative from right at the top of the organisation to address concerns.","“Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to “fixing” Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.” Zuckerberg has been given until next Monday to respond to the request.","Collins’ committee, which has been dubbed the ‘fake news inquiry’, traveled to the US last month. On Wednesday they are set to hear testimony from ex-Facebook employee Sandy Parakilas. Parakilas, who worked on Facebook’s Platform team in 2011-12, will address the committee via video link.","The Committee’s summons follows a taxpayer-funded trip to the US in February where they heard from representatives of Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, CBS News, CNN International and the New Media Alliance. The committee was told by the company’s respective representative that there was little or no evidence of their platforms effecting the outcome of Brexit, or the US presidential election.","The Zuckerberg summons follows the UK’s Information Commissioner announcing it is to apply for a search warrant for Cambridge Analytica’s (CA) offices. The London based firm faces accusations that it used the personal data of around 50 million Facebook users in order to influence the 2016 US presidential election in Donald Trump’s favor.","The accusations stem from CA’s former employee turned whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who claimed the company amassed the data of millions of people through a personality quiz on Facebook.","CA’s executives, Eton-educated Alexander Nix and Mark Turnbull, were secretly filmed by Channel 4 News suggesting other methods they use to garner political influence, namely political bribes and honey traps to discredit politicians.

It might be a wake-up call. - Anchorage Daily News","text":["Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the \"Established Adult Life\" peer group.","In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I've grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screenshots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I've clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can't wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I've clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","Facebook's latest crisis of trust, this time inspired by the Cambridge Analytica news, has led many of its users to realize something very important: Facebook's users are not the customers. They're the product.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there's a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","In the Facebook settings for your account – right below the link to deactivate it – there's an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You're giving them everything they need to do it.","Log into your account and go to the settings page. Click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts,","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to go get the file when it's ready. The size of your file – and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it – will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I've been on the platform since 2004, I don't use the Facebook app on my phone, I only keep Messenger on my phone for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences – once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads – information that Facebook says it only retains for a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn't buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me \"Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?\"","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I'll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list, and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a \"fact check\" blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. \"When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,\" the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn't sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There's a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you've ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third party advertisers who have your contact information. According to Facebook, that download might also include the \"unique number\" Facebook assigns to you for facial recognition purposes, based on the photos you've been tagged in on the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Change your Facebook password frequently, but don’t get too worried about some evil marketing genius hacking your brain and making you vote a certain way.","The Cambridge Analytica Facebook data scandal rocking politics has painted an unflattering picture of some political operatives, but it’s hardly worth getting worked up over.","Yet some people are reacting as though voters have lost the ability to think for themselves. Having worked on advertising campaigns for political parties and businesses, I can assure you that’s not the case.","What’s most surprising about this story is how unaware people are when it comes to understanding how companies like Facebook or Google make money. It’s not just about sharing selfies with your friends or looking up a restaurant review. The information you give them on a daily basis forms a core part of their business: selling targeted advertising space.","This data controversy follows an old road of complaints each time political parties embrace new media types. Whether it’s bemoaning “American Style” attack ads on television or “robocall” recorded phone messages, there’s always a group of people who manage to get themselves worked up enough to believe they’re witnessing the end of democracy.","Issues with how personal data and information is shared by gigantic technology companies is worth discussing. And if the company in question broke laws or policies it should be punished. But micro-targeting voters is as mainstream in politics as it is for those who sell running shoes.","When you cruise the internet looking at hotel reviews in Maui, it’s inevitable you’ll be bombarded with ads to visit the Aloha State pretty much every time you look at your phone or open your laptop. You’re being tracked. Political parties do this too.","Sure, the Cambridge Analytica story is loaded with marketing industry jargon that sounds scary. Phrases like “Big Data” and “Lookalike Audiences.” Yet it’s pretty standard stuff for any digital marketer.","But let’s recall how Cambridge Analytica got this data: 270,000 people downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” to take a personality test. These people surely didn’t need a personality test to let them know they’re naïve.","What matters here is what political campaigns can do with this data. Operatives love Facebook because it’s a two-way street: you don’t just send information, you learn about the people who are absorbing it. This is invaluable data for campaigns to build their target audiences and sell them on their candidate.","Yet there’s no guarantee mastering any of this will win you an election campaign. The only type of political ads that ever work are ones that fit into a larger narrative while tapping into a fundamental truth about a politician, for better or worse.","Barack Obama’s political campaign was “famously data driven” but it also had a winning message. This story shouldn’t be a bigger deal because the antagonist is an unpopular US President.","It is creepy how much companies and political parties know about you. But it’s just one of the trade-offs we make for living in a world where Siri or Alexa proactively give you advice on which road to take on the commute home to avoid a traffic jam.","Remember, you gave them the data in the first place. Don’t be surprised when they use it to talk back to you.","— Dennis Matthews is Vice President Marketing and Communications at Enterprise, he served as strategic communications advisor to former interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose","This Week's Flyers","Comments","We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","See the full visual","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

They used data from at least 50 million Americans, data that was inappropriately obtained—stolen. Christopher Wylie, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica, the data firm owned by billionaire Robert Mercer, has stepped forward with explosive details on how the firm acquired the stolen data of a huge number of Americans. Robert Mercer also happens to a Trump mega-donor and owner of Breitbart News. Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah, have donated tens of millions of dollars to conservative organizations like the Heritage Foundation and plumping up the coffers of Republicans running for office nationwide. The Mercers essentially single-handedly kept Trump’s campaign afloat when others were running away. They also lent the Donald Trump campaign two key staff members. From USA Today:","The intensely private Mercers have emerged as big power brokers in Trump’s Washington. They financially backed Trump’s campaign when many establishment donors steered clear of the brash real estate magnate.","Rebekah Mercer helped persuade Trump to hire two key strategists on his campaign — pollster Kellyanne Conway, who served as campaign manager, and former Breitbart executive Stephen Bannon, who served as the campaign's CEO. Both sit in Trump’s inner circle at the White House. Rebekah Mercer served on the executive committee of Trump’s transition team, alongside three of his adult children, Bannon and other key advisers, including Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment fromRobert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","It is important to understand how this stolen data was used. Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, blew the lid off this story when he came forward over the weekend to expose how this data was stolen and later how it was likely weaponized by Steve Bannon, Cambridge Analytica and eventually the Trump campaign. This is really important. Please take a few minutes to watch this interview and share widely. They didn’t just use this data on Facebook, they wickedly used it across all platforms to alter perceptions, using fake news with real consequences for millions of Americans. And they shared all of the data with a Russian oil company with known Putin and Russian intelligence connections. They used psychologists to weaponize this data with pinpoint accuracy, manipulating public opinion. They corrupted our democracy with this data.","Robert Mercer, Rebekah Mercer, Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway corrupted our democracy and should be investigated with every resource available, especially if they knowingly handed over all of our private information to the Russians."],"isopubdate":""}

This has prompted Parliament President Antonio Tajani to invite the Facebook CEO to the Parliament.","\"I am deeply concerned by allegations that Cambridge Analytica harvested information from Facebook accounts without user consent, exposing key ethical issues surrounding the accountability and responsibility of powerful digital platforms,” said Tajani. “This incident is more than a breach of data, it's a breach of trust that can threaten the very functioning of democracy.”","“I have invited Mark Zuckerberg to the European Parliament to provide explanations, as we have a duty to safeguard citizens' rights and ensure that they are informed, especially with regards to sensitive issues like data protection.\"","What Parliament can do","On Wednesday 17 April, MEPs will discuss whether the European laws are an effective shield against personal data abuse and election manipulation following revelations about abuse of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica.","In addition to holding a debate, other options are also open to Parliament, should MEPs decide to do so. MEPs could adopt a resolution calling on the European Commission to propose measures to tackle the misuse. Parliament may also opt to set up a temporary committee to look into the allegations and possible measures.","What Parliament has done to protect privacy","Parliament has always insisted on the need to reconcile security with the need to safeguard privacy and personal data. It has adopted resolutions addressing the use of passenger name record (PNR) data for the prevention and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime, data mining and the need to protect private information in a digitised world.","The revelations about the misuse of Facebook´s data emerged as the EU prepares for the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation in May. It sets new rules for companies operating in the EU and gives people more control over their private information. The legislation includes the right to know when personal data has been hacked and the right to object to profiling.","The Parliament also wants to step up protection for people using electronic communications by reforming the e-Privacy directive (2002). The proposal seeks to ensure high standards of privacy, confidentiality and security in electronic communications tools such as Messenger, WhatsApp and Skype.","MEPs suggest setting stricter limits on data processing, ensuring that data can only be used for the purpose for which the user has given consent and guaranteeing that meta-data - information about numbers called, websites visited, and geographical location - is treated as confidential and cannot be passed on to third parties."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

{"originalurl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/facebook-data-misuse-cambridge-analytica?CMP=share_btn_tw","title":"Facebook told me it would act swiftly on data misuse – in 2015 | Harry Davies | Opinion | The Guardian","text":["Shortly after the US midterm elections in 2014 – and back when Donald Trump was busy launching the seventh series of Celebrity Apprentice – I received a tip about a little-known British company known as Strategic Communication Laboratories, or SCL. At the time I was working on the Guardian’s investigations desk, and I heard the company’s “election management” consultancy was branching out into US voter targeting with a curious new product and corporate identity. This, I would later discover, was Cambridge Analytica.","After that tip came a small cache of documents. And in December 2014, I wrote to SCL asking about its commercial relationship with a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan, and its apparent acquisition of a vast database of personal information harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users by Kogan’s company, Global Science Research (GSR). At this stage I didn’t know whose political campaign it was working on in the US. It seemed to have acquired the data, but how was it using it? I now regret putting the story on the back burner, but when SCL repeatedly refused to engage, that’s what happened. Back then, few had heard of this company.","Fast forward to autumn 2015 and a source pointed me in the direction of a Politico article that made a connection between SCL and Cambridge Analytica. By then it was offering psychological methods for targeting voters to the Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz. So I returned to my investigation and in December 2015 reported that SCL had paid GSR to harvest Facebook users’ data via online questionnaires. GSR boasted it owned “a massive data pool of 40+ million individuals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles.”","Last week, Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, was forced to acknowledge the privacy breach and apologise for the company’s mistakes, embarking on an uncharacteristic media blitz. Yet when I first asked Facebook about the way this data had been siphoned from the social network, the company had little to say. Apparently, it didn’t anticipate the significance the dataset would take on. But then nor did I.","Before we published that story in 2015, I had approached Facebook’s public relations representatives in London to inform them of the allegations. I asked them a series of questions, including: “Is Facebook concerned that highly personal data about a large set of its users is now being exploited for experimental political campaigning purposes?” They didn’t answer. After declining to comment on the record, they emailed a few lines on background: “Facebook has a clear data use policy that makes it clear how the information people choose to add to Facebook is used.” Their repetition of the word “clear” only made this feel more doubtful.","Hours after the story was published, Facebook’s PRs got in touch seeking more information, and later that evening I heard from the mothership itself when a senior, California-based employee emailed a statement. “We are carefully investigating this situation,” it read, “misleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do.” In time, we would come to understand just what Facebook – one of the world’s most powerful companies – meant by “swift action”.","In early 2016, I continued to investigate Cambridge Analytica, pursuing leads about its parent company, SCL, and talking to former employees and clients. I interviewed Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s then CEO and a director of SCL. He refused to say whether he was or wasn’t working in the UK on the leave campaign. (Little did I know SCL had deep ties to the digital firm AggregateIQ, as the Observer reported on Sunday, to which Vote Leave would funnel 40% of its spending.) “We’ve been talking to all sorts of political parties about different matters in the UK,” he told me. In the US, Nix said that “hundreds of thousands of people across America” had taken Cambridge Analytica’s online questionnaires, but claimed respondents’ Facebook accounts were not accessed. He was dismissive of the privacy concerns posed by political campaigns hoovering up voters’ personal data: “If the individuals wish to remain more private then they shouldn’t consent to give up their information.”","As Trump surged in the polls, Sheryl Sandberg told investors the election was 'a big deal in terms of ad spend'","As I read through Nix’s comments in my notes two years later, I am struck by the similarity between his logic and that of Facebook. In rejecting the media’s characterisation of this large-scale privacy violation as a “data breach”, Facebook claims “everyone involved” in the 2014 data-siphoning exercise had given their consent. “People knowingly provided their information,” the company claimed. As with its interpretation of the word “clear”, Facebook seems to have a skewed understanding of what “knowingly” really means.","Facebook’s senior executives may now be feeling apologetic, “outraged” even. But in January 2016, as Trump surged in the polls, Facebook’s COO, Sheryl Sandberg, told investors the 2016 election was “a big deal in terms of ad spend”. In other words, a major commercial opportunity. The ability to target voters, she said, was key: “Using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those,” she boasted. “And we’re seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting.”","It’s perhaps worth remembering, then, that until recently Facebook was encouraging political operatives to take full advantage of its garden of surveillance. And while aspects of the Cambridge Analytica affair may be surprising, and offer a disturbing glimpse into the shadows, the routine exploitation of information about our lives – about who we are – is what’s powering Facebook. It’s the behemoth’s lifeblood."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

This week, we received an unusual one. It was sent to us in the wake of a Wall Street Journal report about an internal conflict at Facebook over Donald Trump’s xenophobic posts on the social network. The tipster sent us a screenshot of a poll from their News Feed that asked, “Are you concerned about America’s future if Donald Trump becomes president?”","Image: Screenshot from a Gizmodo tipster. Its authenticity has been verified by Facebook.","Advertisement","At face value, the poll appears to be one Facebook itself is conducting. The screenshot shows the words “Facebook would like to hear from you” (emphasis original) across the top of the post, and it even shows Facebook’s logo where a profile photo would normally be. At the bottom of the post is a message that reads: “Facebook will keep your identity confidential.”","But the post also explicitly states it’s a sponsored poll, and when we reached out to Facebook, a spokesperson confirmed that “this was an advertiser-sponsored poll.” After a short follow up email sent for clarification, the spokesperson said, “Correct, not created by Facebook.”","So who created the poll, and why is it anonymous? Unfortunately, we’re not sure. Facebook said it couldn’t disclose what campaign or entity was doing the polling, but the spokesperson did mention that this kind of anonymity is available to all advertisers. Facebook clearly outlines pricing of its different polling packages, but the company does not advertise anonymous polling. When I briefly tried to replicate the poll, I was unable to, and Facebook did not respond to my request for information about how such a poll can be created.","Advertisement","The company was also unable to provide any statistics about which users are able to participate in polls, how many are conducted, or any other questions that would give us an idea of the scope of the polling operation. The spokesperson sent a link to this Adweek story to “demonstrate it’s been existence for years.” It’s also important to note that Facebook has used polls in the past to ask about user experience.","The social media company has been under fire this entire election over its role as a news provider. In May, Gizmodo first reported allegations that the bias of Facebook’s trending news curators was influencing what millions of users were (and weren’t) able to see in their trending modules. The previous month, we reported that Facebook employees had asked Mark Zuckerberg in an internal poll: “What responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017?” More recently, the Wall Street Journal reported on Facebook employees arguing internally about whether to remove Donald Trump’s posts about banning Muslims on the premise that they violated the site’s rules on hate speech.","Have you ever seen a poll that says “Facebook would like to hear from you” in your News Feed? Have you ever seen one where the advertiser’s profile photo is featured? Have you ever conducted an anonymous poll as a small or large business?

Gifts of goods or\nservices are called in-kind contributions. For example, a committee makes an in-kind contribution when it:","Pays for consulting, polling or printing services provided to a candidate committee;","Donates office supplies or mailing lists to a campaign;","Sponsors a fundraising event benefiting a candidate; or","Pays for a campaign advertisement on behalf of a candidate (if the advertisement does not qualify as an independent expenditure).","Value","The dollar value of an in-kind contribution is subject to limits and must be reported. The value of a particular in-kind gift is determined as follows:","Goods (such as equipment, supplies, facilities and mailing lists) are valued at their normal purchase or rental price.","Services (such as advertising, printing or consulting) are valued at the prevailing commercial rate at the time the services are rendered (i.e., the amount that was paid or would have been paid for the services).","Discounts are valued at the amount discounted (i.e., the difference between the usual and normal charge and the amount paid by the committee).","Opinion polls","Allocation among candidates","If a nonconnected committee supports more than one federal candidate through an in-kind contribution, the contribution must be allocated among the candidates so that a portion of it counts toward the committee’s limit for each candidate. The value attributed to each candidate must be in proportion to the relative benefit each candidate\nis expected to receive.","Example: Allocation among candidates","A committee sponsors a fundraising dance on behalf of several candidates. The portion of the costs attributed as a\ncontribution to each candidate must be based on the ratio of funds received for each candidate to the total funds received for all the candidates.","Allocating shared costs of fundraising for federal and nonfederal candidates","A “direct candidate support” activity is an in-kind contribution that supports specific candidates. In-kind contributions that must be allocated\ninclude payments for fundraising activities conducted on behalf of both federal and nonfederal candidates. Allocation is not required, however, if shared expenses are paid entirely by the federal account.","Failure to allocate expenses when required could result in a contribution by the nonfederal account to the federal account—a violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act.","Payment of allocable candidate fundraising expenses","Payment from federal account","The committee may pay the entire amount from its federal account, transferring funds from the nonfederal account to the federal account only to cover the nonfederal share of allocable expenses.","Payment from allocation account","The committee may establish a separate allocation account for the sole purpose of paying joint federal and nonfederal expenses.","Under the second option, the committee transfers funds from both the federal and nonfederal accounts to the separate allocation account in amounts equal, respectively, to the federal and nonfederal\nshares of each allocable expense. The allocation account is considered a federal account, and the committee must include the account’s receipts and disbursements in its FEC reports.","Timing of internal transfers","The committee must transfer funds from the nonfederal account to the federal account (or to the allocation account) within a 70-day “window”— not more than 10 days before or 60 days after the original payment to the vendor. The committee must report each\nsuch transfer and itemize the activities the transferred funds are intended to pay. (A transfer from the federal account to the allocation account is permissible at any time and is not reported separately.)","Time limits also apply to adjustments of the allocation ratio and corresponding transfers, which may be required after an activity where federal and nonfederal funds are raised.","Allocation ratios","Funds received ratio","Used for: Direct fundraising costs of events that support both specific federal and specific nonfederal candidates.","Calculation:","Costs are allocated according to the ratio of funds received for the federal account (or candidates) to the total funds received through the fundraising event.","Committees with separate federal and nonfederal accounts must use the following allocation ratios to determine the federal and nonfederal share of allocable activity expenses.","Reporting allocating costs of fundraising for candidates","This section explains how to allocate the costs of a direct candidate support activity that raises money for both federal and nonfederal candidates. The explanation is based on the following scenario:","Each election year Civil Republic PAC, a nonconnected committee with separate federal and nonfederal accounts, sponsors a fundraising dinner-dance to benefit federal and nonfederal candidates in a particular state.","This election year, the committee plans to use the event to raise money for five candidates—a Senate candidate, a House candidate and three candidates for the state legislature. In past election years the committee has raised about $5,000 for all participating\ncandidates, and the committee has customarily divided the proceeds evenly between the federal and the nonfederal candidates. In this election year, Civil Republic PAC expects the two federal candidates to split half the proceeds, while the three state\ncandidates will evenly divide the other half.","The total costs of the event are expected to be $1,000, which are in-kind contributions to the candidates.","Unique identifier","Every allocable direct candidate support activity must be assigned a unique identifying name or code. On Schedule H2, Civil Republic PAC uses “Dinner-Dance” as the event’s unique identifier. When referring to the dinner-dance in subsequent schedules and\nreports, the committee must continue to use “Dinner-Dance.”","Allocation ratio","Because the dinner-dance is a fundraising event for candidates, the committee allocates the $1,000 expected total costs according to the “funds received ratio” (i.e., funds received by federal candidates compared with funds received by all candidates).","Since Civil Republic PAC expects that half the proceeds will go to federal candidates and half to nonfederal candidates, the funds received ratio is 1/2. Expressing this ratio in percentages, Civil Republic PAC enters 50 percent federal and 50 percent\nnonfederal in the appropriate spaces on Schedule H2.","To indicate the purpose of the event, the committee checks the “Direct Candidate Support” box.","Payments","Civil Republic PAC pays the bills for the event from its federal account (or separate allocation account) and reports the payments on Schedule H4. Because the payments are in-kind contributions,\nthe federal share of the costs is cross-referenced to a Schedule B for Line 23 and included in the total figure for Line 23 (Total Contributions to Federal Candidates) on the Detailed Summary Page.","On each page, the committee uses “Dinner-Dance” (the unique identifier) as the name of the event. The “event year-to-date” figure represents the aggregate amount spent on the dinner-dance (to all payees) as of the date of payment.","Transfer of funds","To cover the nonfederal share of the costs of the dinner-dance, Civil Republic PAC transfers $500.00 from the nonfederal account to the federal account (or separate allocation account). The amount transferred is one half of the $1,000.00 total payments\nfor the ballroom. The transfer is made within the 70-day window.","Civil Republic PAC reports the receipt of the transfer on Schedule H3. The amount is also included on Line 18(a) of the Detailed Summary Page.","Adjustments","At a later date, Civil Republic PAC may have to adjust the allocation ratio for the event if the federal candidates receive a different proportion of the actual funds raised than was originally reported\non Schedule H2. The adjusted allocation ratio must be reported on a new Schedule H2 filed with the next report.","As a result of adjusting the allocation ratio, the nonfederal account may have paid more than its allocable share. In that case, the federal account must reimburse the nonfederal account for its excessive payments and report the reimbursement on Schedule\nH4. The reimbursement must also be included in the Line 23 total on the Detailed Summary Page and itemized on Schedule B.","If an adjustment indicates that the federal account paid more than its share of allocable expenses, the committee may transfer funds from the nonfederal account to make up for the excessive nonfederal payment. Such transfers, however, may only be made\nwithin 60 days after the event. Transfers from the nonfederal account are itemized on a Schedule H3 and included in the total for Line 18(a) on the Detailed Summary Page.","This information is not intended to replace the law or to change its meaning, nor does this information create or confer any rights for or on any person or bind the Federal Election Commission or the public."],"isopubdate":""}

{"originalurl":"https://www.wired.com/story/the-cambridge-analytica-data-apocalypse-was-predicted-in-2007/","title":"The Cambridge Analytica Data Apocalypse Was Predicted in 2007 | WIRED","text":["The Cambridge Analytica Data Apocalypse Was Predicted in 2007","Share","The Cambridge Analytica Data Apocalypse Was Predicted in 2007","Getty Images","In the early 2000s, Alex Pentland was running the wearable computing group at the MIT Media Lab—the place where the ideas behind augmented reality and Fitbit-style fitness trackers got their start. Back then, it was still mostly folks wearing computers in satchels and cameras on their heads. “They were basically cell phones, except we had to solder it together ourselves,” Pentland says. But the hardware wasn't the important part. The ways the devices interacted was. “You scale that up and you realize, holy crap, we’ll be able to see everybody on Earth all the time,” he says—where they went, who they knew, what they bought.","And so by the middle of the decade, when massive social networks like Facebook were taking off, Pentland and his fellow social scientists were beginning to look at network and cell phone data to see how epidemics spread, how friends relate to each other, and how political alliances form. “We’d accidentally invented a particle accelerator for understanding human behavior,” says David Lazer, a data-oriented political scientist then at Harvard. “It became apparent to me that everything was changing in terms of understanding human behavior.” In late 2007 Lazer put together a conference entitled “Computational Social Science,” along with Pentland and other leaders in analyzing what people today call big data.","In early 2009 the attendees of that conference published a statement of principles in the prestigious journal Science. In light of the role of social scientists in the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica debacle—slurping up data on online behavior from millions of users, figuring out the personalities and predilections of those users, and nominally using that knowledge to influence elections—that article turns out to be prescient.","“These vast, emerging data sets on how people interact surely offer qualitatively new perspectives on collective human behavior,” the researchers wrote. But, they added, this emerging understanding came with risks. \"Perhaps the thorniest challenges exist on the data side, with respect to access and privacy,” the paper said. “Because a single dramatic incident involving a breach of privacy could produce rules and statutes that stifle the nascent field of computational social science, a self-regulatory regime of procedures, technologies, and rules is needed that reduces this risk but preserves research potential.”","Possibly even more disturbing than the idea that Cambridge Analytica tried to steal an election—something lots of people say probably isn’t possible—is the role of scientists in facilitating the ethical breakdowns behind it. When Zeynep Tufekci argues that what Facebook does with people’s personal data is so pervasive and arcane that people can’t possibly give informed consent to it, she’s employing the language of science and medicine. Scientists are supposed to have acquired, through painful experience, the knowledge of how to treat human subjects in their research. Because it can go terribly wrong.","Here’s what’s worse: The scientists warned us about big data and corporate surveillance. They tried to warn themselves.","In big data and computation, the social sciences saw a chance to grow up. “Most of the things we think we know about humanity are based on pitifully little data, and as a consequence they’re not strong science,” says Pentland, an author of the 2009 paper. “It’s all stories and heuristics.” But data and computational social science promised to change that. It’s what science always hopes for—not merely to quantify the now but to calculate what’s to come. Scientists can do it for stars and DNA and electrons; people have been more elusive.","Then they’d take the next quantum leap. Observation and prediction, if you get really good at them, lead to the ability to act upon the system and bring it to heel. It’s the same progress that leads from understanding heritability to sequencing DNA to genome editing, or from Newton to Einstein to GPS. That was the promise of Cambridge Analytica: to use computational social science to influence behavior. Cambridge Analytica said it could do it. It apparently cheated to get the data. And the catastrophe that the authors of that 2009 paper warned of has come to pass.","Pentland puts it more pithily: “We called it.”","The 2009 paper recommends that researchers be better trained—in both big-data methods and in the ethics of handling such data. It suggests that the infrastructure of science, like granting agencies and institutional review boards, should get stronger at handling new demands, because data spills and difficulties in anonymizing bulk data were already starting to slow progress.","Historically, when some group recommends self-regulation and new standards, it’s because that group is worried someone else is about to do it for them—usually a government. In this case, though, the scientists were worried, they wrote, about Google, Yahoo, and the National Security Agency. “Computational social science could become the exclusive domain of private companies and government agencies. Alternatively, there might emerge a privileged set of academic researchers presiding over private data from which they produce papers that cannot be critiqued or replicated,” they wrote. Only strong rules for collaborations between industry and academia would allow access to the numbers the scientists wanted but also protect consumers and users.","“Even when we were working on that paper we recognized that with great power comes great responsibility, and any technology is a dual-use technology,” says Nicholas Christakis, head of the Human Nature Lab at Yale, one of the participants in the conference, and a co-author of the paper. “Nuclear power is a dual-use technology. It can be weaponized.”","Welp. “It is sort of what we anticipated, that there would be a Three Mile Island moment around data sharing that would rock the research community,” Lazer says. “The reality is, academia did not build an infrastructure. Our call for getting our house in order? I’d say it has been inadequately addressed.”","Cambridge Analytica’s scientific foundation—as reporting from The Guardian has shown—seems to mostly derive from the work of Michal Kosinski, a psychologist now at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and David Stillwell, deputy director of the Psychometrics Centre at Cambridge Judge Business School (though neither worked for Cambridge Analytica or affiliated companies). In 2013, when they were both working at Cambridge, Kosinski and Stillwell were co-authors on a big study that attempted to connect the language people used in their Facebook status updates with the so-called Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism). They’d gotten permission from Facebook users to ingest status updates via a personality quiz app.","Along with another researcher, Kosinski and Stillwell also used a related dataset to, they said, determine personal traits like sexual orientation, religion, politics, and other personal stuff using nothing but Facebook Likes.","Supposedly it was this idea—that you could derive highly detailed personality information from social media interactions and personality tests—that led another social science researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, to develop a similar approach via an app, get access to even more Facebook user data, and then hand it all to Cambridge Analytica. (Kogan denies any wrongdoing and has said in interviews that he is just a scapegoat.)","But take a beat here for a second. That initial Kosinski paper is worth a look. It asserts that Likes enable a machine learning algorithm to predict attributes like intelligence. The best predictors of intelligence, according to the paper? They include thunderstorms, the Colbert Report, science, and … curly fries. Low intelligence: Sephora, ‘I love being a mom,’ Harley Davidson, and Lady Antebellum. The paper looked at sexuality, too, finding that male homosexuality was well-predicted by liking the No H8 campaign, Mac cosmetics, and the musical Wicked. Strong predictors of male heterosexuality? Wu-Tang Clan, Shaq, and ‘being confused after waking up from naps.’","Ahem. If that feels like you might have been able to guess any of those things without a fancy algorithm, well, the authors acknowledge the possibility. “Although some of the Likes clearly relate to their predicted attribute, as in the case of No H8 Campaign and homosexuality,” the paper concludes, “other pairs are more elusive; there is no obvious connection between Curly Fries and high intelligence.”","Kosinski and his colleagues went on, in 2017, to make more explicit the leap from prediction to control. In a paper titled “Psychological Targeting as an Effective Approach to Digital Mass Persuasion,” they exposed people with specific personality traits—extraverted or introverted, high openness or low openness—to advertisements for cosmetics and a crossword puzzle game tailored to those traits. (An aside for my nerds: Likes for “Stargate” and “computers” predicted introversion, but Kosinski and colleagues acknowledged that a potential weakness is that Likes could change in significance over time. “Liking the fantasy show Game of Thrones might have been highly predictive of introversion in 2011,” they wrote, “but its growing popularity might have made it less predictive over time as its audience became more mainstream.”)","Now, clicking on an ad doesn’t necessarily show that you can change someone’s political choices. But Kosinski says political ads would be even more potent. “In the context of academic research, we cannot use any political messages, because it would not be ethical,” says Kosinski. “The assumption is that the same effects can be observed in political messages.” But it’s true that his team saw more responses to tailored ads than mistargeted ads. (To be clear, this is what Cambridge Analytica said it could do, but Kosinski wasn’t working with the company.)","Reasonable people could disagree. As for the 2013 paper, “all it shows is that algorithmic predictions of Big 5 traits are about as accurate as human predictions, which is to say only about 50 percent accurate,” says Duncan Watts, a sociologist at Microsoft Research and one of the inventors of computational social science. “If all you had to do to change someone’s opinion was guess their openness or political attitude, then even really noisy predictions might be worrying at scale. But predicting attributes is much easier than persuading people.”","Watts says that the 2017 paper didn’t convince him the technique could work, either. The results barely improve click-through rates, he says—a far cry from predicting political behavior. And more than that, Kosinski’s mistargeted openness ads—that is, the ads tailored for the opposite personality characteristic—far outperformed the targeted extraversion ads. Watts says that suggests other, uncontrolled factors are having unknown effects. “So again,” he says, “I would question how meaningful these effects are in practice.\"","To the extent a company like Cambridge Analytica says it can use similar techniques for political advantage, Watts says that seems \"shady,\" and he’s not the only one who thinks so. “On the psychographic stuff, I haven’t see any science that really aligns with their claims,” Lazer says. “There’s just enough there to make it plausible and point to a citation here or there.”","Kosinski disagrees. “They’re going against an entire industry,” he says. “There are billions of dollars spent every year on marketing. Of course a lot of it is wasted, but those people are not morons. They don’t spend money on Facebook ads and Google ads just to throw it away.”","Even if trait-based persuasion doesn’t work as Kosinski and his colleagues hypothesize and Cambridge Analytica claimed, the troubling part is that another trained researcher—Kogan—allegedly delivered data and similar research ideas to the company. In a press release posted on the Cambridge Analytica website on Friday, the acting CEO and former chief data officer of the company denied wrongdoing and insisted that the company deleted all the data they were supposed to according to Facebook’s changing rules. And as for the data that Kogan allegedly brought in via his company GSR, he wrote, Cambridge Analytica “did not use any GSR data in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election.”","Either way, the overall idea of using human behavioral science to sell ads and products without oversight is still the core of Facebook's business model. “Clearly these methods are being used currently. But those aren’t examples of the methods being used to understand human behavior,” Lazer says. “They’re not trying to create insights but to use methods out of the academy to optimize corporate objectives.”","Lazer is being circumspect; let me put that a different way: They are trying to use science to manipulate you into buying things.","So maybe Cambridge Analytica wasn’t the Three Mile Island of computational social science. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t a signal, a ping on the Geiger counter. It shows people are trying.","Facebook knows that the social scientists have tools the company can use. Late in 2017, a Facebook blog post admitted that maybe people were getting a little messed up by all the time they spend on social media. “We also worry about spending too much time on our phones when we should be paying attention to our families,” wrote David Ginsberg, Facebook’s director of research, and Moira Burke, a Facebook research scientist. “One of the ways we combat our inner struggles is with research.” And with that they laid out a short summary of existing work, and name-checked a bunch of social scientists with whom the company is collaborating. This, it strikes me, is a little bit like a member of congress caught in a bribery sting insisting he was conducting his own investigation. It’s also, of course, exactly what the social scientists warned of a decade ago.","But those social scientists, it turns out, worry a lot less about Facebook Likes than they do about phone calls and overnight deliverys. “Everybody talks about Google and Facebook, but the things that people say online are not nearly as predictive as, say, what your telephone company knows about you. Or your credit card company,” Pentland says. “Fortunately telephone companies, banks, things like that are very highly regulated companies. So we have a fair amount of time. It may never happen that the data gets loose.”","Here, Kosinski agrees. “If you use data more intrusive than Facebook Likes, like credit card records, if you use methods better than just posting an ad on someone’s Facebook wall, if you spend more money and resources, if you do a lot of A-B testing,” he says, “of course you would boost the efficiency.” Using Facebook Likes is the kind of thing an academic does, Kosinski says. If you really want to nudge a network of humans, he recommends buying credit card records.","Kosinski also suggests hiring someone slicker than Cambridge Analytica. “If people say Cambridge Analytica won the election for Trump, it probably helped, but if he had hired a better company, the efficiency would be even higher,” he says.","That's why social scientists are still worried. They worry about someone taking that quantum leap to persuasion and succeeding. “I spent quite some time and quite some effort reporting what Dr. Kogan was doing, to the head of the department and legal teams at the university, and later to press like the Guardian, so I’m probably more offended than average by the methods,” Kosinski says. “But the bottom line is, essentially they could have achieved the same goal without breaking any rules. It probably would have taken more time and cost more money.”","Pentland says the next frontier is microtargetting, when political campaigns and extremist groups sock-puppet social media accounts to make it seem like an entire community is spontaneously espousing similar beliefs. “That sort of persuasion, from people you think are like you having what appears to be a free opinion, is enormously effective,” Pentland says. “Advertising, you can ignore. Having people you think are like you have the same opinion is how fads, bubbles, and panics start.” For now it’s only working on edge cases, if at all. But next time? Or the time after that? Well, they did try to warn us."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

It's talking about how to monetise Johnnny's social graph.\"","Advertisement","He added: \"Ask yourself who is paying for Facebook. Usually the people who are paying are the customers. Advertisers are the ones who are paying. If you don't know who the customer of the product you are using is, you don't know what the product is for. We are not the customers of Facebook, we are the product. Facebook is selling us to advertisers.\"","Rushkoff believes that this lack of understanding is a construct of software companies who don't want you to understand their inner workings. He explained that in the early 1990s, to use a computer was the same thing as to program a computer. He explained: \"It took anywhere from a few hours to a day to learn how to use a computer back then, but then you knew the whole thing. You were using the computer. You weren't dependent on boxes of software you bought off the shelf, you were making that world as you went along. There was no such things as an 'end user', just a 'user'. We were all equals.\"","However, he explained, companies realised it was hard to make money out of people who communicated with each other through interfaces that they made themselves. So they created more of a distance between the programmer and the user, building packages of software that were easy-to-use but removed the end user from being able to appreciate the baises embedded within them. \"I'm not asking you to know how your computer works and how to change the power supply or solder,\" he said. \"I'm asking that you understand the language, the interface, the software that the computer is using. You don't want your kids to be James Joyce, you just want them to learn how to write. If you are not prepared to program then you are being programmed.\" \"It's not the difference between being a driver and a mechanic, I'm talking about the difference between being a driver and a passenger. If you depend on a driver like in Driving Miss Daisy, you'd better trust Morgan Freeman.\" He said.","Advertisement","One of the barriers to understanding is a reticence among some programmers to reveal their processes. \"I'd love everyone to document their code on their website, explaining how it works and why they made this or that decision.\"","He proposes that we create interfaces that encourage programming literacy rather than protecting proprietary software. I guess he hasn't heard about initiatives such as Codeacademy?","How do you see your relationship with Facebook? Do you realise you are being 'sold' to advertisers? Or are you just like poor little Johnny?"],"isopubdate":""}
