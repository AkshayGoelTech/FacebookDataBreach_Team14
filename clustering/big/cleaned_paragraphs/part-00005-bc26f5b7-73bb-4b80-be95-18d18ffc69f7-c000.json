For more posts by Fennel, click here.","Facebook has unparalleled access to data tracking more than a billion individuals across the globe.","This access is “given” by people who would be denied access to Facebook and their “friends” if they do not agree to baffling terms and conditions. These Facebook users may not even be aware of what they’re disclosing or are so overwhelmed by the reality of what they’re revealing about themselves that they may be in denial of the potential consequences.","Regardless of what people tell themselves, there is an undeniable anxiety that feeds persistent rumors that Facebook spies on their users via the microphones and cameras on their mobile devices. This excellent ReplyAll podcast gives fascinating examples of how and why this notion persists in the general public, and just how hard it is to dispel even for the technically aware.","Metadata’s power does not come from any one piece of information, but from the sum of many insignificant pieces of information. All the little pieces are cleverly combined and correlated to guess precise and thoroughly creepy information that we never provided directly.","To give an idea of some of the information Facebook can infer about you, here is a list of nearly 100 spookily precise categories that they allow advertisers to use when targeting you.","Facebook has a lot more little insignificant pieces of information than we can easily grasp. It is impossible to really list every single possible piece of data that the site can capture about us, but I will try anyway!","The data Facebook potentially has on us all can be classified in 7 key categories:","1. Data your hand over willingly: everything you post directly; everything you ‘like’; every location check-in you make; all your friends/followers; all messages you send privately to your friends/followers; all your searches.","2. Data they can gather about your behaviour on their properties without any real consent: all your clicks; how long you stay on each image/video/text; how your mouse moves around (correlates with eye movements); all you type but don’t submit.","3. Data they can gather without any real consent about your behaviour on other properties that include Facebook spyware (ads, pixels, share/like buttons): all the same information as 1 & 2 combined; also Facebook create shadow profiles for tracking ‘users’ who have never used a Facebook service.","4. Data they can gather without any real consent from your phone/tablet: fine detailed geo-location over time; what other apps you use; files (videos/photos/documents) on your devices; user names, contacts, messages, calls; the name and metadata of every WiFi hotspot and BlueTooth device you have ever connected to; the infamous camera/microphone surveillance that they deny.","5. Data they can gather without any real consent from your phone/tablet via other apps: same as 3 but without installing any Facebook app on your device; for example, Facebook bought a VPN app that can report back on all internet traffic from all apps on a device with the app installed.","7. Online data they can buy and/or get via partnerships without any real consent: results of online tests you have taken for fun, which are often run by data stalking companies to build psychometric profiles (for example think Cambridge Analytica).","This list is far from complete, but this is all real data that we know Facebook and similar companies gather. None of it requires using the microphone and camera permissions that you ‘agreed’ to give them during installation.","And it’s only the beginning. They are also using cutting edge psychological research to manipulate what we see to secretly push changes in our behavior, including related to voting. Like Google, it has bought a generation of the world’s best and brightest in fields as diverse as AI and anthropology, and put them all to work day and night trying to make the ultimate in paid advertisements.","We are wasting so much talent that could be curing diseases, elevating humanity, and making the world a more just and free place. And on what? Twisting society into a fishbowl with a very few people standing outside watching and making invisible changes to our water for their own purposes.","Protecting our privacy matters to the whole society. Without privacy all other civil and human rights are endangered. This is an obvious area where government regulation can make sense to restrict and outlaw socially destructive behaviors. This is what regulation is for: creating incentive structures that make our society more tolerable for more people, rather than the opposite.","Tags","Rate this article","4 Comments","So…A question I’ve had for a while. I have ExpressVPN, and use it every time I go online. However, I don’t think VPNs will stop Facebook from tracking me, right? If anything, it’ll just have them track me from a different IP.","The answer is a little bit complex, but in general, no, a VPN won’t stop Facebook from tracking you. A VPN basically transfers trust from your ISP, or whoever is providing the WiFi hot-spot you are using (Starbucks, an airport, your friend at their home, ..), to the company whoever runs the VPN service.","I’m not familar with ExpressVPN, but a quick check (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExpressVPN) suggests that they have had issues with poor security practices and continue to have issues around transparency, which personally I would find worrying.","The people who run any VPN service you use can technically spy on any of your traffic, can change that traffic, and do a lot of nasty things. If you cannot fully trust that provider, then this can be pretty risky. The same is true if you don’t have a VPN on when you connect to a random “free” public WiFi hotspot or to your ISP. In some places like the EU you can largely trust your ISP (except against government surveillance), due to legal protections, but that is not true in most of world, including the largely unregulated US market.","And of course a reputable VPN provider will expressly state that they will never do any of these things, and put in place processes to prevent it from happening. Basically, at some point you will have to trust someone – the difficulty is deciding who that someone will be. Trust is a serious problem in the VPN market as there are so many fly-by-night operations and outright scams that it can be very hard for normal users to find something reputable (see for example this CSIRO research on mobile VPNs explained by WIRED: https://www.wired.com/2017/02/beware-mobile-vpns-arent-safe-seem/).","In terms of tracking, the IP address you come from is only a very small part of how tracking is done. Our VPN service (F-Secure FREEDOME) does strip a lot of tracking domains (a fairly unusual feature for a VPN service), but that can never be perfect, and again does not cover all the techniques available to track people online.","Already, if you are Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram, or user of any Facebook property, you will likely have cookies saved on your browser (or the app on your phone) in order to not have to login multiple times per day. Those cookies directly can track you across the web on any other website that continues content from Facebook (for example adverts from their network and “share” buttons). Having a VPN does not remove your cookies or other stored tracking information.","Even if you are careful to avoid these accounts and/or religiously logout and clear your cookies, your browser itself is very identifiable via a large array of “browser fingerprinting” techniques. The EFF has a nice page (https://panopticlick.eff.org/) to test how unique your browser is and how many bits of potentially identifying information you are providing about yourself just by how your device and browser are configured. Even this is far from a complete survey of all the techniques available to unscrupulous surveillance economy companies.","So what to do? First, without serious regulation with hard consequences for these companies, you just cannot avoid all this tracking. You can however avoid a lot by combining solutions. Obviously, first don’t use services from Facebook and similar companies if you can possibly avoid it. This is clearly not always possible for most people, so when you do use them, try to logout and remove cookies as much as you can. Also consider using a completely different browser only for those services (a hygiene measure that is also recommended for banking services – i.e. 3 separate browsers ideally).","Second, you can get a lot of tracking hygiene by combining a reputable VPN service, a good ad-blocker (e.g. uBlock Origin & EFF’s Privacy Badger), and forcing HTTPS use as much as possible (EFF’s HTTPS Everywhere).","More advanced users can also go a step further by blocking as much JavaScript as possible, for example by using the NoScript plugin. Unfortunately a lot of sites force the use of JavaScript even to view basic static text+image websites, so NoScript use does require manual adjustment and some small inconvenience. That said, it does allow you to block the worst offenders and only accept running this unknown software on your computer when it is from the site itself and only when actually needed, rather than running random code (code which is mostly there for different kinds of surveillance) from 20 external domains for each site you visit.","Than you for the writeup. But I think you don’t adress/explain a few issues/concerns extensively enough so it is understood what you actually mean with the points.","Like buttons on other websites follow you around and call home to facebook. What exactly is reported to the shadow profile? Can we know or is all traffic always encrypted?","Connected logins, “use facebook to log in”, what actually is submitted to facebook? is there a facebook shared session cookie set keeping track of everything for instance or just very limited interaction? It is a very convenient but quite concerning feature.","Notification plugins. What do they actually keep track of and report back? Basically browser plugin technology could be used to get access to every page you visit, even hijack the traffic and enable man in the middle attacks.","A BIG concern is also 3rd parties, connected apps and friend requests used for data mining. All it takes is one friend installing a particularly bad app with extensive permissions and it has access to ALL the data the user itself has access to on facebook, meaning all friend’s info, posts, PM’s, photos, etc. So accepting uknown people as friends is bad (access to their data viewed as a friend) but an infinitley worse issue is the apps (access to their own data viewed almost or fully as themselves and friend data viewed as them).Through networking not many people at all need to install the app and data will be accuired exponentially from their friend circles. Significant privacy implrovements might have been done here, I am not up to speed with their services, but a few years back this was the case I’m pretty sure."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-10"}

That means that around 300,000 people could sign up for a personality test quiz, and in the process hand over information of 150 times that number.","Now, however, Facebook apps are only allowed to gather information from users who have directly signed up for them, greatly limiting their reach. That change was made in 2014, and rolled out to every Facebook app over the course of 2015.","But it’s still the case that apps which you have directly enabled can harvest a significant amount of data from your account – often information which you might be surprised to know you’re handing over.","The app settings page on Facebook is the place to manage the apps you’ve given access to. Clicking on the link will bring up a list of apps under “logged in with Facebook”. Hopefully you’ll recognise most of them – if there’s any you don’t, consider clicking the “X”, deauthorising them from your account.","You might also want to click on the edit button under the “apps others use” heading lower down the page. This takes you to your privacy settings for the modern version of the same feature Cambridge Analytica profited from. The information others can hand over on your behalf is limited, but still includes data such as your date of birth, religious and political views, and activities, interests and things you like. Consider unchecking all the boxes. According to Facebook, leaving them all checked will make your friends’ “experience better and more social”, which doesn’t seem like a good trade-off for you.","If that’s not enough for you to feel safe, maybe now’s the time to delete your Facebook account altogether.","That’s somewhat harder to do. If you go through the account settings, Facebook will attempt to push you to “deactivate” your account, which “will disable your profile and remove your name and photo from most things that you’ve shared on Facebook”. Notably, it won’t remove any of your data from Facebook’s servers, and your account lies dormant hoping you will change your mind.","If you actually want to delete your information from Facebook, the real setting is hidden in a help document with the title “how do I permanently delete my account?” Clicking on “let us know” on that page will take users to the real account deletion screen. Clicking “delete my account” will take you to another screen. Filling in your password and proving you aren’t a robot on that screen will finally… deactivate your account. Wait two weeks after that, and then, at long last, Facebook will begin the 90 day process of deleting all your data from the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

However we would still like to hear from Mr Zuckerberg as well,\" Collins said at the start of a committee hearing on Tuesday.","\"We will seek to clarify with Facebook whether he is available to give evidence or not, because that wasn't clear from our correspondence.","\"And if he is available to give evidence, then we would be happy to do that either in person or via video link if that would be more convenient for him.\"","The EU has given the social media giant two weeks to answer its own queries over the scandal, which has heavily hit Facebook's share price and raised major questions over how social media companies use private data.","EU justice commissioner Vera Jourova wrote to Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, asking what measures the company plans to take to prevent a similar scandal.","She also asked whether stricter rules were needed for companies like Facebook as exist for traditional media, and whether it would change its approach on transparency toward users and regulators.","- Address questions 'at senior level' -","Facebook insists it did not know the data taken from its site were being used by a British company, Cambridge Analytica, which worked on US President Donald Trump's election campaign among others.","However, its rules at the time allowed an app developed by an academic researcher, which was downloaded by an estimated 270,000 people, to take information from millions of their friends.","In her letter, Rebecca Stimson, head of public policy for Facebook UK, revealed that the tech giant was working with regulators around the world to assess how many people in each country were affected.","\"We can now confirm that around one percent of the global downloads of the app came from users in the EU, including the UK,\" she wrote.","Amid investigations by lawmakers in Europe and the United States, Zuckerberg has taken out adverts in US, British and German newspapers in recent days apologising for the \"breach of trust\".","But the company is struggling to contain the growing crisis.","US consumer protection agency, the Federal Trade Commission, on Monday confirmed it had opened an investigation into whether Facebook mishandled private data or violated a 2011 agreement which settled an earlier probe.","In her letter to the British committee, Stimson said: \"Facebook fully recognizes the level of public and parliamentary interest in these issues and support your belief that these issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position to answer your questions.","\"As such, Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence in person to the committee.\"","She said either Schroepfer or Cox could attend \"straight after the Easter parliamentary recess\", meaning April 16 at the earliest."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The data inside was not particularly usable for a Facebook user, except on Facebook.","But with all the controversy surrounding Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data of 50 million user profiles was misused, many users are reexamining their own relationship with the platform and the data it has.","It takes a few minutes for Facebook to prepare your archive into a .zip file to download, and once it’s unzipped, you can view it by double-clicking on the file “index.htm.” (The interface is web-based and will open in a browser.)","What your archive says","Your digital life, compressed into an archive, may be bizarre to see. Your relationships, should you have made them public are front and center in your details. Your email addresses, the names you used on Facebook (I used a fake name until 2014), your workplaces (one of mine just says “yes yes hi hello”), and all the things you “liked.”","Over the years, Facebook had different ways to deal with that stuff, so everything doesn’t quite match up perfectly. There used to be a place for favorite movies and books, and most of that merged to a general “Other” category. (Except for the movies category, which for me still displays “Roadhouse.”)","Among the items in the file are your entire timeline, which includes posts from previous iterations of Facebook, when posting on people’s walls, which comprised the bulk of a user’s interactions on the platform. (Perhaps it was not even a platform yet.)","Everything you and others posted is there, including all the things people wrote, assuming they were simply shouting into the abyss, figuring no one was listening. Facebook was, and they wrote it down!","Also present are the ad topics Facebook thinks you’d be into, the ads you’ve actually clicked on — this doesn’t seem complete, it says I clicked on only a few in just 2018 — and the advertisers that possess your data. Some of them are really weird: A friend texted me to say that “Rod Stewart” is listed under the advertisers that have his data. My editor’s archive showed that a bunch of cruise lines — and the musician Beck – had her data. (She has no idea why, and when asked whether she even likes Beck said, “I don’t know?”)","Most unnerving perhaps, are the private messages, compiled in one place. We get new phones or clear our old phone texts, but Facebook doesn’t have storage issues. It’s all here.","All of this should not be news to you. Facebook’s 3 billion users give this information willingly, and we certainly expect the company not to delete old posts. But the archive, compiled for the benefit of the user, puts the concept into alarming relief, showing exactly how much of our lives we’ve poured into it. And of course, how easy it is to condense a digital life into a .zip file.","It’s scary, but it’s not a surprise","When you post a photo on Facebook, you expect it to be available — even years later. Recently, Facebook even made a feature on this, showing friend retrospectives for friend anniversaries in your newsfeed. Similarly, the motivation for the collection of some of this data – advertising – was detailed in the fine print. Unfortunately, most don’t read the fine print and thus miss this devil in the details. (Though the fact that a 13-year-old is expected to read and understand this may trouble some.)","How Facebook can interpret all this data may be of more interest. You can see what their conclusions are if you read this article. From the data you provide as a user, what you “like” on the platform, they can get a decent picture of who you are.","Another friend and Facebook user I talked with noted that it was interesting that people seem more concerned with “psychographic data” rather than the fact that Equifax exposed 150 million Social Security numbers, something that has identity theft and financial security implications. The answer, of course, is because there’s a small-ish .zip file —mine was 34 megabytes filled with secrets. If it got loose, it would be pure KOMPROMAT. (Update your password.)","From a personal data hygiene perspective, if all this doesn’t sit well with you, the only thing you can really do is delete the contacts you may have uploaded to Facebook. Though you can make things hidden, purging the site of your data seems to mean full-scale account deletion, if you want to set fire to your old activity."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ ”","That, as reported by The Washington Post, was Donald Trump boasting during a private fund-raising dinner about lying to Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, our northern neighbor and closest ally.","When caught in the lie, Trump did what Trump does: Repeats the lie, louder, stronger, and more stridently.","After the lie was reported, Trump tweeted:","“We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S. (negotiating), but they do … they almost all do … and that’s how I know!”","“In 2017, the United States had a $23.2 billion deficit with Canada in goods. In other words, the United States in 2017 bought more goods from Canada than Canada bought from the United States.","However, the United States had a $25.9 billion surplus with Canada in services — and that was enough to overcome that deficit and turn the overall balance of trade into a $2.8 billion surplus for the United States in 2017. The same pattern occurred in 2016.”","It bears repeating that Donald Trump is a pathological, unrepentant liar. We must state this truth for as long as he revels in untruth.","But there is something about the nakedness of this confession, the brazenness of it, the cavalier-ness, that still has the ability to shock.","First, why does the president of the United States not know whether we have a trade surplus or deficit with Canada? A pillar of his campaign was to renegotiate Nafta. Surely he understood the basic fundamentals before making wild accusations and unrealistic promises, right? Wrong.","Trump’s recalling of the story suggested that he was somehow overpowering and outmaneuvering Trudeau, free to best him because he was unencumbered by an allegiance to the truth.","But in fact, the story makes Trump look small and ignorant and unprincipled.","Lying to your friends and then bragging behind their backs that you lied to them is the quickest way to poison a friendship.","This is lying for sport, for the thrill of it, because you can and feel that there is no penalty for it.","Our relationship with our allies around the world depends on some degree of mutual trust and respect. What must they think when they watch Trump demolish those diplomatic tenets? How are international agreements supposed to be negotiated when one party is a proven, prolific liar?","We have no idea just how damaged the American brand has become under Trump.","“Although he has only been in office a few months, Donald Trump’s presidency has had a major impact on how the world sees the United States. Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe, and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations.”","The report continued:","“According to a new Pew Research Center survey spanning 37 nations, a median of just 22 percent has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. This stands in contrast to the final years of Barack Obama’s presidency, when a median of 64 percent expressed confidence in Trump’s predecessor to direct America’s role in the world.”","Surely, some may think this lie to Trudeau is a small matter, particularly in light of the waves of Trump chaos and scandal that wash over us several times a day.","But it is this damaging of truth, this injuring of American identity, this undercutting of American credibility that will be the hardest to reverse.","One of Trump’s most lasting legacies will likely be the damage he’s doing to the fundamental idea that truth matters.","The world is watching, and that includes the world’s children, some of whom will register him as their first American president. How will they regard this absence from world leadership that Trump is enacting? Will they grow up repulsed by it? Most hopefully will. But there will undoubtedly be others that draw a different lesson from the Trump philosophy: Create your own reality; populate it with “facts” of your own creation; use lying as a tactic; remember that strict adherence to truth is a moral barrier and morality is a burden.","This is what this man is projecting: A debauched character and a hollow place where integrity should exist.","Rather than preserving the nobility of the presidency, he is debasing it. Rather than burnishing the image of America, he is tarnishing it.","It is an awful fact that the most powerful man in America may also represent the worst of America. In a way, Trump is the un-American president."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Where your friends lived, worked, and went to school — not to mention their interests and the pages they had liked — were all fair game.","The feature was well-intentioned, of course. One app, Job Fusion, used the functionality to show users job openings at the places their friends worked. The video-sharing app Vine let users see which of their Facebook friends also used the app — until, Facebook cut off its competitor’s access.","But, notably, developers didn’t have to delete the information they had already collected. This weekend, in a pair of reports by the Observer and the New York Times, we learned what one developer did with the data it retained.","Using an innocuous looking quiz and an accompanying Facebook app, a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan collected data from a staggering 50 million Facebook users on behalf of data analytics company Cambridge Analytica. The firm is reported to have used all that data to build detailed profiles on the personalities of American and British voters, for use by Republican political candidates during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Brexit’s Vote Leave Campaign.","And as outrageous as that may sound, Facebook was operating exactly as it was designed to at that time — a design that left millions of its users unwittingly exposed.","How the harvesting happened","According to both newspapers, about 270,000 people installed Kogan’s Facebook app, which was portrayed as part of an online personality quiz that participants were paid to take. The Observer estimated that each user who installed Kogan’s app granted him access to profile information from at least 160 of their friends. All told, he was able to harvest data on 50 million Facebook users in a matter of weeks.","Users were told the data being collected was for academic purposes, and both Facebook’s terms of service and British data protection laws prohibited Kogan from selling or sharing the data with third parties without their consent. But the data was provided to Cambridge Analytica nonetheless.","Facebook says, ‘Everyone involved gave their consent.’ Yet millions of users did not — not explicitly — nor likely expected their data to be shared just because they were friends with someone who participated in a quiz. (Toby Melville/Reuters)","The firm “then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyze individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour,” according to the Observer’s report. That algorithm could be used to more effectively target Facebook ads to the people their analysis determined would be most likely influenced by its message.","It may have been a violation of the agreement that Kogan made with Facebook — and a violation of what users reasonably expected from a simple personality quiz app. But that was all that separated the behaviour of Kogan’s app from otherwise legitimate apps. It collected the same type of data that at least hundreds of other developers also had access to at that time.","Was Facebook breached?","The Observer and the New York Times characterize the data that was harvested and provided to Cambridge Analytica as a breach. Facebook, however, disputes this characterization.","In Facebook’s view, Kogan “did not break into any systems, bypass any technical controls, or use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed,” argued the company’s chief security office Alex Stamos in a now-deleted series of posts on Twitter.","“Everyone involved gave their consent,” echoed Paul Grewal, a Facebook lawyer and company executive, in a statement. “People knowingly provided their information.”","Yet millions of users did not — not explicitly — nor likely expected their data to be shared simply because they were friends with someone who participated in a quiz.","It’s also clear that Kogan had access to data that — had he been upfront about his intentions — Facebook would not have intended him to access. He effectively lied his way into accessing data that he shouldn’t have had access to, under the guise of an academic study. Some might consider that social engineering attack.","And notably, both the Observer and the New York Times reported that copies of the data still exist, outside of Facebook’s control.","It may not be a breach in a strict technical sense — but it’s almost certainly a breach of trust, at the very least.","There’s only so much a user can do","It’s worth noting that not all of the data harvested was actually used to build the detailed personality profiles Cambridge Analytica sought. In fact, of the 50 million user profiles scraped, only about 30 million contained enough information to match with existing records obtained from data brokers or provided by political campaigns.","In other words, the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica was only as useful as the quality of personal information that, in the normal course of using Facebook, those users volunteered — the same sort of information that was used to target Facebook users with divisive political ads as part of a broad Russian influence campaign.","Given the fallout from both incidents, it’s possible users may be less eager to be as open with Facebook going forward, given the very real risk their data may be misused — something that critics have warned of for years.","But of course, there is only so much that users can do. Users may decide to keep more information off Facebook than they have in the past, but there are other, less obvious ways the company can collect information.","Others may decide to delete Facebook altogether, or limit how often they log on — but again, the ubiquity of the service makes this impractical, not least for those for whom Facebook has become the primary mode of communication with friends or family."],"isopubdate":""}

A recent report from the auditor KPMG revealed that global investment in fintech — financial technology, that is — totaled $19.1 billion in 2015, a 106% jump compared to 2014; venture capital investment alone nearly quintupled between 2012 and last year.

I wanted to pull the plug. Which is how, ultimately, I found myself in this sterile Swedish backroom staring down a syringe the size of a pipe cleaner. I was here because I wanted to see the future of money. But really, I just wanted to pay for some shit with a microchip in my hand.","The first thing you’ll notice if you ever decide to surrender your wallet is how damn many apps you’ll need in order to replace it. You’ll need a mobile credit card replacement — Apple Pay or Android Pay — for starters, but you’ll also need person-to-person payment apps like Venmo, PayPal, and Square Cash. Then don’t forget the lesser-knowns: Dwolla, Tilt, Tab, LevelUp, SEQR, Popmoney, P2P Payments, and Flint. Then you might as well embrace the cryptocurrency of the future, bitcoin, by downloading Circle, Breadwallet, Coinbase, Fold, Gliph, Xapo, and Blockchain. You’ll also want to cover your bases with individual retailer payment apps like Starbucks, Walmart, USPS Mobile, Exxon Speedpass, and Shell Motorist, to name but a few. Plus public and regular transit apps — Septa in Philadelphia, NJ Transit in New Jersey, Zipcar, Uber, Lyft. And because you have to eat and drink, Seamless, Drizly, Foodler, Saucey, Waitress, Munchery, and Sprig. The future is fractured.","This isn’t lost on Bryan Yeager, a senior analyst who covers payments for eMarketer. “This kind of piecemeal fragmentation is probably one of the biggest inhibitors out there,” he said. “I’ll be honest: It’s very confusing, not just to me, but to most customers. And it really erodes the value proposition that mobile payments are simpler.”","Charlie Warzel / BuzzFeed News","Venmo screenshot.","On a frigid January afternoon in Midtown Manhattan, just hours into my experiment, I found myself at 2 Bros., a red-tiled, fluorescent-lit pizza shop that operates with an aversion to frills. As I made my way past a row of stainless steel ovens, I watched the patrons in front of me grab their glistening slices while wordlessly forking over mangled bills, as has been our country’s custom for a century and a half. When my turn came to order, I croaked what was already my least-favorite phrase: \"Do you, um, take Apple Pay?\" The man behind the counter blinked four times before (wisely) declaring me a lost cause and moving to the next person in line.","This kind of bewildered rejection was fairly common. A change may be coming for money, but not everyone’s on board yet, and Yaeger's entirely correct that the \"simple\" value proposition hasn't entirely come to pass. Paying with the wave of a phone, I found, pushes you toward extremes; to submit to the will of one of the major mobile wallets is to choose between big-box retailers and chain restaurants and small, niche luxury stores. The only business in my Brooklyn neighborhood that took Apple Pay or Android Pay was a cafe where a large iced coffee runs upwards of $5; globally, most of the businesses that have signed on as Apple Pay partners are large national chains like Jamba Juice, Pep Boys, Best Buy, and Macy’s.","Partially for this reason, the primary way most Americans are currently experiencing the great fintech boom isn’t through Apple or Android Pay at all, but through proprietary payment apps from chains such as Target, Walmart, and Starbucks — as of last October, an astonishing 1 in 5 of all Starbucks transactions in the U.S. were done through the company’s mobile app. It wouldn’t be all that hard to live a fully functional — if possibly boring — cash-free consumer life by tapping and swiping the proprietary apps of our nation’s biggest stores.","If that doesn’t feel revolutionary or particularly futuristic, it’s because it’s not really meant to. But the future of mobile retail is assuredly dystopian. Just ask Andy O’Dell, who works for Clutch, a marketing company that helps with consumer loyalty programs and deals with these kinds of mobile purchasing apps. “Apple Pay and the Starbucks payment app have nothing to do with actual payments,” he told me. “The power of payments and the future of these programs is in the data they generate.”","\"The power of payments is in the data they generate.”","Imagine this future: Every day you go to Starbucks before work because it’s right near your house. You use the app, and to ensure your reliable patronage, Starbucks coughs up a loyalty reward, giving you a free cup of coffee every 15 visits. Great deal, you say! O’Dell disagrees. According to him, Starbucks is just hurting its margins by giving you something you’d already be buying. The real trick, he argued, is changing your behavior. He offers a new scenario where this time, instead of a free coffee every 15 visits, you get a free danish — which you try and then realize it goes great with coffee. So you start buying a danish once a week, then maybe twice a week, until it starts to feel like it was your idea all along.","In that case, O’Dell said, Starbucks has \"changed my behavior and captured more share of my wallet, and they've also given me more of what I want.\"","In this sense, the payments rush is, in no small part, a data rush. Creating a wallet that’s just a digital version of the one you keep in your pocket is not the endgame. But figuring out where you shop, when you shop, and exactly what products you have an affinity for, and then bundling all that information in digestible chunks to inform the marketers of the world? Being able to, as O’Dell puts it, “drive you to the outcome they want you to have like a rat in a maze by understanding, down to your personality, who you are”? That’s disruption worth investing in.","Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News (2)","For all its complexity and bureaucracy and importance, money, at its core, is really just information. When FDR weaned the United States off the gold standard in 1933, cash, no longer backed by physical gold, became an abstraction. Today, that abstraction is pushed to new extremes: Not only does 92% of the money in the world exist as a series of ones and zeroes, but now it’s being transferred from place to place by any number of digital intermediaries looking to take a cut.","That process is complicated, but the key issue is trust. Money, argues David Wolman in The End of Money, is not much more than “a belief in a shared purpose, or at least a shared hallucination.” This faith in the “particular religion” of cash has been at the center of standardized currencies since Kublai Khan, and the loss of that faith has been associated with every major economic catastrophe in history. But trust — especially when it comes to new forms of currency — takes time to build.","The first two weeks of my experiment, most people balked when I offered an alternative means of payment. “I’m a little worried this might not go through in time,” one server at a German beer hall told me when I asked if I could Venmo her for my bill. A waiter at a different establishment scoffed when I tried to pay him or the restaurant via PayPal, suggesting his manager would think he was getting ripped off.","Yaeger sees this as standard for a nascent technology. “I kind of equate now to where things were 10 to 12 years ago with e-commerce,” he told me. “The concept of putting credit cards on a screen was new. Retailers and normal people were concerned about that. So innovative companies like PayPal and Amazon built that trust up over a decade while others slowly moved in.”","There are, of course, legitimate reasons not to trust these new forms of payment. Anyone who’s been mugged or lost a wallet knows cash is far from perfect, but this constellation of new digital payment products introduces a whole new category and scale of ways to get robbed, hacked, scammed, and screwed. Venmo — the social payment service that’s now transferring over $1 billion per month — may, in some ways, be the truest glimpse at a mobile payment future, but it’s not exactly entirely secure. Smartphones can be as easily lost and stolen as wallets, but they’re also eminently breakable, orders of magnitude more expensive, and obsolete after two or three years. And the payment-apps landscape is still such that living cashlessly in 2016 means entering your credit card information or routing number into dozens of stand-alone apps, some of which look as if they’ve been built overnight by a high school computer science class.","Charlie Warzel / BuzzFeed News","At the barbershop.","All this risk and all this friction, in the service of...what, exactly? “Plastic works really well,” Randy Reddig, an entrepreneur who was a part of Square’s founding team, told me, taking a shot at what he called “mobile wallet hysteria.” “I have a wallet right now in my pocket, and it’s great. It can feel like this is something that nobody is asking for. It’s solutioneering: Take something that exists just fine in the meatspace world and make it digital and somehow we’re all supposed to believe it’s better.”","To Reddig, the true future of payments is revealing itself inside many of Silicon Valley’s biggest new companies. Airbnb, he said, has one of the most sophisticated payments infrastructures of any company in the world, handling deposits and disbursements in hundreds of markets, many with different currencies. “All the innovation around payments is a means to an end — table stakes,” he said. “Uber has one of, if not the most used mobile payments methods in the world, and it was absolutely crucial — they had to do it to create the experience and service they wanted. Payment technology created certainty for riders and drivers that they’d get paid — it facilitated trust.”","Much as the true value of a retailer’s mobile payment app is in the metadata it gobbles up, the real power of digital payments lies in the largely invisible infrastructure that undergirds them. Fintech companies like Square aren’t exactly sexy, but they allow small businesses and individual merchants to process transactions without prohibitively expensive equipment or the fees that legacy credit companies charge.","\"Millennials don't trust banks, but they trust Apple and Google.\"","“It’s about financial inclusion and serving real, normal people,” Reddig said. \"There is a lot of opportunity to build very profitable businesses that operate better than incumbents in transparency, great design, great user experience. Millennials don't trust banks, but they trust Apple and Google.\"","This is already happening, just outside the U.S. If fintech’s true believers think it’ll fundamentally change the way we live, the developing world is where their vision is revealing itself most clearly. In Kenya, for example, the payment messaging service M-Pesa has attracted over 13 million monthly active users (out of a population of 44.3 million). As of last May, roughly 42% of Kenya’s GDP was transacted via M-Pesa, all without tying Kenyans to expensive, cumbersome bank accounts.","But more than that, M-Pesa has effectively invented a new form of credit that’s based on a history of reliable transactions from phone to phone, rather than through a bank. In a world where 2.5 billion people don’t have bank accounts, systems like M-Pesa are set to leapfrog Western banking the same way much of the developing world skipped the desktop and went straight to the smartphone for its computing needs. In reinventing money transfers, M-Pesa and its ilk offer more than a new way to pay — they are opportunity engines, offering the ability to build credit in a world that previously shut them out. And in the process, there are billions to be made in transfer fees.","By my third week, the cashless, frictionless future I’d hoped to live began to feel glitchy, burdensome, and alienating. I had to meticulously plan my every move hours or even days in advance — a haircut required me to convince my barber to start using Venmo, going out for a meal meant lining up a dining companion willing to submit to confused stares and drawn-out check-settling processes.","One January afternoon, I found myself trying to persuade a prodigiously bearded, flannel-shirt-wearing barista named Michael to allow me to pay him personally via Square Cash for a coffee, which he would then pay the register for. After a confession that this was all for a story from me and a pity laugh from him, Michael reached for his phone, but not before he locked eyes with me. “I’m only doing this because I want you to write about how much this sucks for us,” he said. He went on to talk about a popular coffee app called Cups, which allows customers to order and pay all inside the phone. “It’s like, now everyone who comes in is a robot — they just stare at their phone and wait to have their name called. Nobody even looks at us,” he said.","Charlie Warzel / BuzzFeed News","Michael, barista.","At this point, replacing my wallet with a phone struck me as little more than a shallow gimmick, an academic exercise, like living in a house mid-construction, before the appliances work and the water and electricity have been switched on: It’s entirely doable, and chances are no one’s going to get hurt, but that’s an awful reason to do anything. I needed something more drastic, which is how I found Hannes Sjoblad, who told me, with surprisingly little fanfare, that he could make me a cyborg.","When I contacted Sjoblad, whose LinkedIn profile lists him as the chief disruption officer at the Swedish biohacking group BioNyfiken, he’d been experimenting with NFC and RFID chip implants by hosting chipping parties for curious biohackers-to-be. His xNT NFC chip is really just a prototype: Sjoblad’s implantees are guinea pigs testing out what they believe could become common uses for a technology that’s usually reserved for phones and credit cards. Sjoblad himself uses his as a replacement for his house keys, business cards, and bike locks.","I asked him if I could use the chip — the same kind, more or less, that sits in and powers the Apple, Google, and Samsung Pay parts of our phones — to pay for things in a store; he wasn’t sure, but he knew a programmer who could link it to a bitcoin wallet. We Skyped once and formalized plans to make me an implantee. “I think when you meet us you'll see that we're pretty normal mainstream persons,” he told me over a grainy video chat. “We're not like some underground den of hackers.” He let out the kind of nervous, mischievous laugh you might let slip if you ran an underground den of hackers.","In the meantime, if I couldn’t bring the future to myself, I would have to do the next best thing: get into bitcoin. At its most basic, bitcoin is the very complicated product of advanced mathematics and cryptography, a “peer-to-peer system for online payments that does not require a trusted central authority.” Bitcoin can be mined by those who donate part of their computing power to help verify the peer-to-peer transactions going on in bitcoin’s ecosystem via the blockchain, which is a string of bundled past transactions. (It's a bit like if you loaned part of your computer to your bank to help it process payments across the world and got a very tiny reward for the donation). But bitcoin's real beauty, according to its disciples, is that it’s not really governed by any entity, making it nonreversible, unfreezable, and anonymous, all with very low transaction fees. It's a powerful idea, and bitcoin has been a bolded and underlined bullet point in every future-of-finance argument. But in 2016, almost eight years since its creation, using bitcoin is a world-class exercise in frustration.","Charlie Warzel / BuzzFeed News","The writer using Gyft.","If living without cards and cash meant planning all my purchases in painful detail, living without state-backed currency of any kind only exacerbated the problem. To buy anything immediately out in the physical world, I had to use bitcoin to buy gift cards and then redeem them at the store for groceries, meals, and anything else. When I ran out of toilet paper, I loaded up Gyft, a digital gift card site, and purchased a $15 CVS card, which I then redeemed for Cottonelle as the store opened — all told, a 45-minute ordeal. Splitting the bill was impossible without a friend willing to set up their own bitcoin wallet, and sending money through bitcoin's blockchain technology felt almost purposefully intimidating, with long, wonky wallet addresses, exchanges, and codes.","And again, there’s trust — using bitcoin means transferring real money into a volatile currency, which hit home when bitcoin’s value dropped almost 18% just hours after I converted $800 dollars to book a flight. Though today bitcoin is niche but somewhat stable, it’s not exactly hard to imagine the whole thing melting down overnight. (As a challenge, my editor tasked me with buying something “tangible” with bitcoin’s jokey, basically defunct cousin, Dogecoin: I was rejected by a meme memorabilia merchant on Etsy when I asked to pay for a mug with a cartoon frog using Dogecoin. A new low.)","But simply replacing paper dollars with digital ones isn’t the draw for bitcoin’s biggest advocates. Olaf Carlson-Wee, a 23-year-old early employee at the bitcoin startup Coinbase, has been living almost exclusively on bitcoin for three years. \"The exciting things are not where bitcoin competes with regular money,\" he told me, \"but where the tech is so radically different it creates new modes of behavior.” Carlson-Wee sees apps like Apple Pay as “abstraction layers,” basically just a digital copy of a common credit card — unlike bitcoin, which is a whole new platform.","Adi Chikara, a strategist for 3Pillar Global who has been advising on and investing in companies using blockchain technology for years, sees its elegant, unbreakable cryptographic security as a new way to ensure trust. In some scenarios, he argues, blockchain technology can act as a replacement for currency as a whole. Imagine a system where legal contracts are automatically executed through the blockchain — for example, your monthly car payments are directly linked to your ability to unlock your vehicle and put it in gear. The particulars are complicated, but blockchain has the potential to act as a powerful reinvention of 21st-century bartering. It’s also, ultimately, maybe the only way to ever move past a state-backed currency.","\"It’s solutioneering: Take something that exists just fine and make it digital and somehow we’re all supposed to believe it’s better.”","“We had paper and it was backed by gold, and right now we're trusting the government — but with the blockchain you may not necessarily need the state,” Chikara told me. The early signs of this are around today — Circle, for example, is a peer-to-peer money transfer app, similar to Venmo, which is powered by the blockchain, meaning, unlike Venmo, the payments are instantaneous and can easily be converted into different currencies without fees.","Chikara readily admits we’re years, if not decades, away from a viable, universal blockchain-centric financial system. Like Venmo and Apple Pay and cash, bitcoin is still subject to human error, like in 2014, when the executive in charge of Mt. Gox, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, embezzled and lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. But Chikara still proposes a scenario with no banks and no federal reserve.“There is no printing of money,” he said. “It's owned jointly by the people themselves, and they trust each other.” Blockchain technology is already being tested by traders across the world and has been implemented in the Australian stock exchange. IBM, Nasdaq OMX, Intel, and Cisco are exploring the blockchain and blockchain-based open ledger projects for trading, along with banks like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. And recently Goldman Sachs filed a patent for SETLCoin, the company’s very own blockchain-powered currency.","But perhaps the best description of bitcoin’s potential came from Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, who sees blockchain technology as nothing less than the most significant open platform since the web. “We take what was once a highly controlled system and turn it into a software development problem where people can go nuts,” he said. “And it becomes like the internet, where you have a big open network, people can build whatever they want. The market decides what's good and what's not. And before you know it, you have this great big open network that has all these great ideas on it and things can really start to get interesting.”","Charlie Warzel / BuzzFeed News","Situation Stockholm.","It was the beginning of week four and bitcoin had driven me deeper into my hermetic state — most of my purchases were being made online and my relation to the real world was almost exclusively conducted through a screen of some sort. I needed a change of scenery.","As it turns out, if you yammer about the future of money long enough, somebody is likely to tell you to go to Sweden and see it for yourself. There, among the bountiful sweaters, sunless winters, and impossibly good genes, is the closest thing you’ll find to a truly cashless society. Just 20% of all consumer payments are conducted using cash in Sweden; according to a 2015 survey, only 2% of Sweden’s economy revolves around the ancient, dirty exchange of paper money and coins. I booked my flight rather painlessly using bitcoin (thanks, Expedia!) to figure out how and why 9 million polite socialists have beaten the rest of us to the paperless money future.","With its standing desks, glass-walled meeting rooms, and long corridors lined with stark black-and-white portraits, the office of Situation Stockholm looks like a startup. In fact, it’s almost the complete opposite: a 21-year-old glossy print magazine sold primarily by the city’s homeless population. The portraits on the wall are of the magazine’s vendors, who are, incidentally, some of the first pioneers of cashless street busking.","“A common response from presumptive customers was 'Sorry, I don't have any cash,'” Jenny Lindroth, an operations manager at the magazine, told me. “So we started to think of ways to take this cash business — a lot of our vendors don't have bank accounts — digital.” In 2007, Situation Stockholm started giving select vendors the ability to sell the magazine by having customers text a number, which would then add a charge to their cell phone bill. In 2013, the company bought card readers from a Swedish payment company called iZettle and sent its most reliable vendors out with them.","Charlie Warzel / BuzzFeed News","Situation Stockholm.","Since then, Situation Stockholm has seen an uptick in sales for vendors, as well as a newfound agency. “People outside the country seem to think that it’s interesting or funny that homeless people have these phones and card readers, but it's not really big news here in Sweden,” Lindroth said. “It's just common practice now — in Sweden you don't have cash.”","Walking around Stockholm’s icy cobblestoned sidewalks and winding, low-arched alleyways, I found myself ducking into countless shops, bars, and konditori cafés, eavesdropping on checkout registers and craning my neck for a peek at local wallets. Not once did I see a paper bill. Paying by phone was commonplace, and I didn’t even get a weird look when I scanned a QR code at a grocery store checkout and wordlessly strolled away with my basket of smoked meats.","According to Jacob de Geer, the CEO of iZettle, Sweden’s cashlessness can be traced back to the early 1990s, when tax subsidies encouraged citizens to buy early personal computers en masse, thereby making the country extra technologically adventurous. But all that early adoption hasn’t been easy for everyone. Swedish banks have drastically cut back on ATMs, raised cash transaction fees roughly 300% in the last four years, and made depositing as inconvenient as possible. Recently, Lindroth witnessed an elderly woman being turned away at the bank after she attempted to deposit a large amount of cash she’d been storing at home. “If she had transferred that money from her phone, she wouldn’t have been questioned in the same way.”","Charlie Warzel / BuzzFeed News","Stockholm in 2015.","The problem, according to Björn Eriksson — a former head of the Swedish police and Interpol, and a prominent dissenting voice in the country’s rush to cashlessness — is not the end of paper money, but the speed of the transition, which is especially hard on older generations, those in rural areas, tourists, and new immigrants who come to the country without cards or bank accounts. “It’s gotten so that some people are resorting to hiding money in their microwave because they have nowhere to put it,” Eriksson told me. It can even be dangerous to public health: Just last September, Sweden’s highest court ruled against the Kronoberg County Health Authority and reprimanded them for not accepting cash as legal tender for medical services in all but two of their health clinics.","Access to new technology is never evenly distributed. And even those like iZettle’s de Geer, who are enabling and profiting from a digital payments revolution, have reservations about abandoning paper money outright: “Everyone thinks I'd like to see the death of cash, but privacy is a big issue for all of us. Cash’s benefit is privacy. There's plenty that's legal to buy out there that you don't want everyone to know you've bought.” If America is headed down Sweden’s cashless path, we have much to learn from our Scandinavian friends.

They see it as the Mark of the Beast. I just want you to be prepared.” I nodded like this is something I had expected to hear.","This comes from the Book of Revelation: “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond to receive a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads; and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast or the number of his name.”","The passage essentially describes a closed economic system, where power is consolidated and financial gatekeepers can shut anyone out. It made for a potent metaphor. I’d spent the last three weeks in search of a connected, seamless future, but I found myself more separated than ever from the people around me.","Around week two, I’d noticed how robotic my interactions had become during any financial transaction: walk into some reliable big-box establishment, mumble order, flash phone, move down the line. Moments like my conversation at the coffee shop with Michael, the barista, heightened these concerns. The brick-and-mortar world of commerce is in the midst of a rewiring — one that’s supposed to bring in more merchants and give consumers more access to what they want when they want it. But that means new behaviors, some of which are likely to be harmful.","Charlie Warzel / BuzzFeed News","New commerce apps and technology may have a lower barrier to entry than, say, credit cards, but many of these programs — like miles cards — reward you and work best when you’ve got money to spend. And while much of fintech is billed as liberating us from the old ways and institutions, new gatekeepers are bound to emerge, in many respects, guiding us — perhaps unwittingly, at times — toward the outcomes that their data analysis has told them we want.","Bitcoin evangelists are optimistic, but the legacy banking system is as inescapable as it is flawed. Even today’s most disruptive money solutions are still reliant on traditional institutions. While Kenya’s M-Pesa allows money to be transferred from phone to phone outside of banks using the cellular company Vodafone’s network, at the end of the day, the transferred money is still backed by the pooled accounts held in regulated commercial banks.","Bitcoin or blockchain-based currencies could free us from the tyranny of service fees and interest rates and all the regulations that complicate and ultimately exclude merchants and large populations from the global economy. Or bitcoin could be adopted by legacy institutions that will strip the technology of its open platforms and use it to create a slick, more efficient model of the current system.","The fumes from Chai’s alcohol swab jolted me back into the moment. “OK, just a slight pinch, here,” he said. “Sometimes it helps to look away.”","Courtesy CityMD","Being chipped was oddly anticlimactic. A trip to the doctor revealed that I hadn’t done anything too horrible to myself. “Wait, you’re telling me I can unlock doors with that thing?” my physician cheerily inquired when I asked if I should be worried about my body rejecting the chip. “I might have to get one myself!” Over the course of a few weeks, the whole thing became an afterthought; a piece of me that stored information, like a low-tech flash drive that I couldn’t misplace.","But there was still the problem of payments. I reached out to former Venmo employee and co-founder Iqram Magdon-Ismail, who then enlisted the help of Nuseir Yassin, another former Venmo employee, to help me become the first person to pay for a meal with his hand.","I asked Magdon-Ismail, who’d had a hand in building one of the most successful person-to-person money transferring apps, to explain the allure of the payments industry. “One side effect of this industry is that you make a lot of money if you move a lot of money,\" he said. \"If you're serving an underbanked community with a financial product, you get a couple hundred thousand users and you make a small return on each one of them — well, that's a really good business, right there.”","Katie Notopoulos / BuzzFeed News","“It's a big pie,” eMarketer’s Yeager said of the money to be made in the payments space. “It's going to be around $100 billion by the end of this year, and that’s just retail mobile commerce.” Similarly, Jeremy Allaire, who runs Circle, cited a study by the Aite research group suggesting that personal payments in the U.S. is a $1.2 trillion market, 90% of which is cash and checks. “What if you can help introduce a new behavior?” he said of the opportunity to capture some of that money.","As Alex Rampell, a general partner and fintech investor at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, told me, the genius of Apple Pay isn’t in the \"tap to pay in the physical world\" at Whole Foods but the ability to store payment credentials and personal information for millions of cardholders and create a one-touch fingerprint payment method across the entire web. If successful, Apple will have cemented itself as the most widely used and reliable online payment passport, allowing consumers to stop paying premiums at online retail giants like Amazon for the simple convenience of one-click payments. And then, Rampell suspects, Apple will make the digital wallet available to developers.","I’d spent the last three weeks in search of a connected, seamless future, but I found myself more separated than ever from the people around me.","“If Apple and Google are smart about this, they’ll encourage opening the wallet up as the next platform,” he said. “Imagine allowing budgeting apps like Mint to operate on top of the wallet so that they help you budget your finances in real time. Or allowing lending companies to build a plugin to the Apple Wallet so every person who uses Apple Pay saves 50% on their interest rates? That could force a company like Capital One into bankruptcy by no fault of its own. And that’s a big, big deal.”","All that potential is intoxicating. Over the course of my month, I found myself unexpectedly buying into the possibilities of bitcoin, seduced by the ease of phone-waving payment. It feels good to be hopeful about these things, to imagine that there's a way beyond crazy fees you never asked for — a way to replicate the safety, trust, and stability of banks without their consolidation of power and bureaucracy. But disrupting at software speeds in the physical world means feeling growing pains — usually important, ignore-at-your-own-peril signals — without having time to consider and interpret them. It turns progressive early adopters like those in Sweden into a system that can exclude its elderly and consolidate power in a handful of banks, all in the name of some kind of progress. The future of money is coming — there’s no stopping it. But there is a matter of control, of receiving the future incrementally and responsibly.","Weeks passed and normal life returned, save for the still-unused microchip in my left hand. It had become a life raft for the experiment, which had largely failed to yield the kinds of aha moments I had assumed I'd be having when I locked away my wallet. And despite the hype and the influx of money and the feeling that everything is just about to change, it’s going to take real time. (It’s very much worth noting that just in the week before this story was published, the fintech peer-to-peer lending darling Lending Club’s CEO resigned over an internal probe concerning improper loan sales; a security breach in a Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange resulted in the loss of at least $2.14 million; and the massive retailer-led consortium MCX has significantly delayed — perhaps killed — the rollout of its digital wallet, CurrentC, to “concentrate more heavily” on other non-mobile-commerce areas of the financial sector.) That’s because today's fintech is more evolutionary than it is revolutionary. And when this change does happen, it will do so on the backs of a new generation that isn't just asking for a new money model but is demanding it.

I’d given Yassin full access to my Venmo account, after which he set up a server linked to my unique Venmo payment key. Now his code was working in test runs. We picked a restaurant — a Sri Lankan place on New York’s Lower East Side that’s partly owned by Magdon-Ismail and of course accepts Venmo — and Yassin coded the chip so that it would launch a website on the merchant’s device when scanned. The site would trigger a payment from my Venmo account with an automatic 20% tip. All I’d need was my hand.","We got to the restaurant a bit after noon on a cold, rainy Monday.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2IBKHco?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.f52b6ecc5237","title":"U.S. and European officials question Facebook’s protection of personal data - The Washington Post","text":["U.S. and European officials on Sunday called for Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how personal information about tens of millions of users ended up in the hands of a data analysis firm that worked for President Trump’s 2016 campaign — without the permission or knowledge of the vast majority of those affected.","News reports about Facebook’s role in the aggressive form of data collection also have raised serious questions about whether the company violated a landmark consent decree with a federal watchdog agency designed to prevent privacy violations. Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Several have taken to Twitter with the finding that Facebook has records of their calls and messages.","When you download Facebook’s app, it asks for access to your phone contacts, which it uses for its friend-recommendation algorithm. It now makes clear that it wants access to call logs and SMS logs as well, but in the past, Android users may have given Facebook access to this data unknowingly, as a result of the way Android dealt with asking permission for call logs.","Before Android 4.1 (a.k.a. Jelly Bean), which was released in 2012, when an Android user gave Facebook access to phone contacts, Facebook also got access to actual call and text data by default.","The permissions in the Android API were subsequently changed, but according to Ars Technica, developers could get around the change if they wrote apps to previous versions of the API. In October 2017, Google finally deprecated version 4.0 of the Android API.","Facebook has now published a post that says the feature was available for Android phone users who downloaded its Facebook Lite and Messenger apps.","“When this feature is enabled, uploading your contacts also allows us to use information like when a call or text was made or received,” it said. “This feature does not collect the content of your calls or text messages. Your information is securely stored and we do not sell this information to third parties.” It also gave instructions on how to control or delete the information.","The answers may not comfort those who already feel the network isn’t handling their private information as carefully as it should.","It may not much matter.

Kogan maintains that he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","Facebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor – Kogan’s business partner at the time their company acquired the data, using an app called thisisyourdigitallife.","Cambridge Analytica – a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon – used the data to build sophisticated psychological profiles of US voters.","Facebook’s public statements have omitted any reference to GSR, the company Kogan incorporated in May 2014 with Chancellor, who at the time was a postdoctoral research assistant.","The Guardian asked Facebook several questions about its recruitment of Chancellor and any action it had taken in light of the data harvesting scam conducted by GSR. Facebook initially promised to respond to a set of questions by Sunday, but then said it had nothing to say on the matter. Chancellor did not respond to repeated requests for comment.","The psychologist, who is 38, is understood to have been a junior partner to Kogan, who oversaw GSR’s business dealings and then elicited the help of several of his students. One source with some knowledge of Chancellor’s role at the company described him as “just the data guy”.","However, both Kogan and Chancellor were listed as directors of GSR when it was founded and provided a “service address” in Harley Street, London.","In the months that followed the creation of GSR, the company worked in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica to pay hundreds of thousands ofusers to take the test as part of an agreement in which they agreed for their data to be collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions strong. That data sold to Cambridge Analytica as part of a commercial agreement. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising.","Chancellor resigned his directorship of GSR in September 2015, according to company records. He joined Facebook around November 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile.","The following month, the Guardian published the first story detailing how Kogan and Chancellor’s company had unethically sourced data that was then passed to Cambridge Analytica, which at the time was working for the presidential campaign of Ted Cruz.","Facebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor at that stage. His role at Facebook was mentioned in a story by the Intercept 12 months ago. At that time, Facebook said in a statement: “The work that he did previously has no bearing on the work that he does at Facebook.”","Chancellor, who was conducting postdoctoral research at Cambridge University when GSR was set up, is understood to have been one of several students who Kogan involved in his project.","Data scandal is huge blow for Facebook – and efforts to study its impact on society","Read more","Since joining Facebook, some of Chancellor’s academic research has been published in peer-reviewed journals. However, the precise nature of his work for Facebook is unclear. The company employs many in-house social scientists to conduct research on the psychology of its users.","In 2014, Facebook was revealed to have conducted a vast experiment on users, without their consent, which entailed tweaking the amount of positive and negative content appearing on their feeds to see if the tech giant could manipulate some kind of “emotional contagion”.","Last year, leaked documents revealed how Facebook had told advertisers they had the capacity to monitor posts in real time and identify when teenage users were feeling “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”.","That kind of finite information is invaluable to advertisers – whether selling products or political candidates – as it helps them more effectively tailor and target their message to individual users on the platform.","Facebook’s ability to create granular profiles of its users has been at the very core of its business model, transforming the social media platform into one of the most profitable companies on the planet."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

The company currently expects revenue in the range of $910 million to $915 million in the 2018 fiscal year.","Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information.

It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.","It's worth noting that according to the Times report, Stamos was encouraged by Facebook's communications team to tweet in defence of the company as news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke — but only after every word had been approved.","Stamos, whose original staff of 120 people has been whittled down to 3 people, is now having his tweets dictated to him by comms staff.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Here’s How It Changed My View of Humanity","text":["I Quit Liking Things On Facebook for Two Weeks. Here’s How It Changed My View of Humanity.","a hopeful look at what happens when you quit the Like","On August 1st, 2014, I announced that I was going to quit liking things on Facebook. At the time, I simply stated that I no longer wanted to be as active a participant in teaching Facebook how to advertise to me as I had been in the past, but another and much larger issue was my real curiosity: how was my Facebook experience going to change once I stopped feeding its engine with likes?","I quit the Like, and it was hard.","The first thing I noticed was how difficult it was to not like things on Facebook. As I scrolled through updates, my finger instinctively gravitated towards the Like button on hundreds of posts and comments. It has become a gut-level, Pavlovian response. I saw updates I liked or wanted others to know I liked, and I found myself almost unconsciously clicking my approval.","The Like is the wordless nod of support in a loud room. It’s the easiest of yesses, I-agrees, and me-toos. I actually felt pangs of guilt over not liking some updates, as though the absence of my particular Like would translate as a disapproval or a withholding of affection. I felt as though my ability to communicate had been somehow hobbled. The Like function has saved me so much comment-typing over the years that I likely could have written a very quippy, War-and-Peace-length novel by now.","As the days wore on, though, my Like avoidance became easier to exercise, and it seemed to be reaping benefits when I noticed a significant difference in my Facebook news feed. I wasn’t sure if my experience was worth writing about, though, until I read an article by Mat Honan called I Liked Everything I Saw on Facebook for Two Days. Here’s What It Did to Me. Honan chose to like everything on Facebook instead, and he experienced the polar opposite of what I did when I quit the Like. Our findings, when paired together, underscored what I believed my experiment with quitting the Like had uncovered.","#1 Benefit of Quitting the Facebook Like: A Better Facebook News Feed","It’s impossible to tell with any scientific certainty that my Facebook feed is markedly different than it used to be, but it sure looks that way.","You would think that liking certain updates on Facebook would teach the algorithm to give you more of what you want to see, but Facebook’s algorithm is not human. The algorithm does not understand the psychological nuances of why you might like one thing and not another even though they have comparatively similar keywords and reach similar audiences, so when I liked several videos and images of heartwarming animal stories, Facebook’s algorithm gave me more animal stories, but many of them were not heartwarming. They depicted inhumane treatment. Apparently, Facebook’s algorithm mistook my love for animals as a desire to see images of elephants being brutalized.","The algorithm made the same mistake with politics and fashion and lifestyle posts. In showing me more of whatever it inferred that I wanted to see from my Likes, my Facebook experience included a lot of things I really didn’t like, because its algorithm doesn’t understand the many political, philosophical, and emotional shades of a given topic. Liking a local animal hospital does not equal my wanting to see abused dogs, and liking a post about a sweet wedding does not not equal my wanting to see every inspiring human who ever existed in New York. The algorithm can’t know that, though, because it can’t know individuals.","It seems that the Like function had me trapped in a universe where the environment was dictated by a knee-jerk ad-bot. You like yogurt? You’ll like Extreme Yogurt more! You liked eight cute kitten videos? You’ll really want to see to this graphic image of eight kittens being tortured by scientists!","Now that I am commenting more on Facebook and not clicking Like on anything at all, my feed has relaxed and become more conversational. It’s like all the shouty attention-getters were ushered out of the room as soon as I stopped incidentally asking for those kinds of updates by using the Like function. I have not seen a single repugnant image of animal torture, been exposed to much political wingnuttery, or continued to drown under the influx of über-cuteness that liking kitten posters can bring on. (I can’t quit the kittens.)","I feel as though reason has been restored. I can comment on a cute cat photo without being inundated with all the animal videos 800 people shared this week, and I can comment on a post about race relations without then having Facebook trot out an endless showcase of vitriol.","Facebook without the Like appears to be nearly sane.","#2 Benefit of Quitting the Facebook Like: More Humanity and Love","When I disallowed myself Facebook’s Like function as a method of communication, I was left with this unmet desire to let people know I heard them or liked their content, and I suddenly felt invisible. I was reading, but no one knew I was there, which made me realize that my habitual style of Facebook interaction had to change. Without the Like function to rely on, I had to comment or risk looking anti-social and experience even more disconnection, so I started commenting more than I ever had before on the platform.","When once I would have simply liked someone’s photo of their new baby, now I commented with “What a gorgeous shock of hair.” When once I would have liked someone’s update about their wedding anniversary, I now typed “Remember how we hid from your grandmother in the gazebo and smoked cigarettes?” I used sentences to affirm parenting wins, share my secret to enjoying kale smoothies (blending the kale first), and make jokes about the sociopathy of house cats.","I had been suffering a sense of disconnection within my online communities prior to swearing off Facebook likes. It seemed that there were fewer conversations, more empty platitudes and praise, and a slew of political and religious pageantry. It was tiring and depressing. After swearing off the Facebook Like, though, all of this changed. I became more present and more engaged, because I had to use my words rather than an unnuanced Like function. I took the time to tell people what I thought and felt, to acknowledge friend’s lives, to share both joys and pains with other human beings.","It turns out that there is more humanity and love in words than there are in the use of the Like.","In short, the end of the Like made Facebook better and brought back the love.","Again, my experiment with quitting the Like on Facebook has not been scientific. I kept no statistics, I tracked no specific users, and I created no fancy pie charts. My experiential outcome, though, has been clear, and it has clearly been the opposite of what Mat Honan found when he liked everything. Facebook is just better without the Like.","When I used to like everything that did not actively bore me or make me feel hateful, my stream of Facebook updates was more like a series of soapboxes spouting outrage dotted with weddings, cute baby animals, and only occasionally real content worth pursuing. Since I stopped liking altogether, though, my Facebook stream is more akin to an eclectic dinner party. There is conversation, there is disagreement (mostly) without hostility, and there is connection. It seems as though I am getting more of what I actually want rather than just being served more extreme versions of what I Like.","I have longstanding and outspoken issues — terrible social algorithm aside — with Facebook’s Terms of Service, its privacy issues, and its micro-nudging of a large portion of the planet’s population into less and less desirable behaviours, but once I removed the Like function from my own behaviour, I almost started to like using Facebook. It turns out that your friends might actually be more likeable than Facebook’s Like disruption makes them appear, and the growing sense of disconnection that many of us experience might just be due to a tone-deaf algorithm.","When we drop the Like, we might actually like each other. We might actually connect.","Quit the Like. See if it amplifies the humanity in your Facebook.","Give the Like a rest and see what happens. Choose to comment with words. Watch how your feed changes. I haven’t used the Like on Facebook since August 1st, and the changes in my feed have been so notably positive that I won’t be liking anything in the foreseeable future.","Not so secretly, I think the humanity and love, the kinder middle grounds not begging for extremes, that many of us have come to believe are diminishing in the world at large are simply being drowned out by an inhuman algorithm, and I think we can bring those socially vital experiences back out into the light.","Quit the Like and experiment with amplifying a better signal. What will happen to your Facebook without your likes? What will happen to your perception of not only your Facebook friends but the world at large? What will happen to us?","UPDATE, JULY 2015:","I began this experiment on August 1st, 2014, and as of July 2015, I continue to not use the Like function on Facebook. My positive results remain the same. Viva the not liking!","UPDATE, 14 AUGUST 2017:","Three years ago yesterday, I published an article about what I discovered when I quit liking things on Facebook for two weeks. It’s now been three years and two weeks since I quit liking things (aside from a few pages), and I’m going to see what it’s like on the other side again. Starting today, I will be hitting the like button on Facebook again to see what happens to my timeline, my behaviour, and my relationships there. After not liking Facebook status updates for so long, not-liking is going to be a whole new habit to break."],"isopubdate":"2014-08-13"}

The paper calls it Facebook's biggest data breach to date.","The details come from a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who said he worked with Aleksandr Kogan, a professor at Cambridge University, to obtain the data. Kogan created an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" that paid users to take a personality test. Participants had to sign in through their Facebook login and agree to let their data be used for academic purposes.","The app went beyond its seemingly stated scope, however, pulling in data from the friends lists of any test-takers. Facebook's platform policy only allows developers the use of friend data to enhance a user's personal experience. The app put that data, from more than 50 million profiles in all, to work instead.","All the data mined from the app became a vital piece of the software Cambridge Analytica used to profile United States voters and serve them with personalized ads ahead of the 2016 election. The U.K. firm has been credited in the past for playing a key role in Donald Trump's ascent to the White House.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,\" Wylie said.","According to The Observer, Facebook \"took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals\" after learning of the \"unprecedented\" data harvesting in late 2015. It's not clear why more drastic steps weren't taken back then, though yesterday's action is easier to decode.","Facebook's Friday suspension of Cambridge Analytica from the platform came four days after The Observer asked the social media company for comment on the whistleblower's story. Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, was also suspended while the investigation plays out.","Wylie provided The Observer with a dossier of evidence illustrating Cambridge Analytica's alleged misuse of the data, including emails, invoices, contracts, and bank transfers that point to the scope of what was harvested. Also in the dossier is an August 2016 letter from Facebook lawyers instructing Wylie to destroy any data collected by Global Science Research, Kogan's front company.","The letter arrived just a few days before Stephen K. Bannon, a part owner of Cambridge Analytica and former vice president of the company's board, signed on as Trump's campaign manager.","Facebook takes the position that data harvested by GSR and Cambridge Analytica doesn't qualify as a breach. In a statement given to The Observer, the social media company claims Kogan's app \"gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels\" but \"did not subsequently abide by our rules\" as the info was passed along to third parties.","The company also said Kogan's app was removed in 2015, and anyone with access to the data had to certify that it had been destroyed. That timing doesn't line up with Wylie's August 2016 letter, however.","\"We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,\" Facebook vice president Paul Grewal said in a statement.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Rometty discussed how AI-enabled services will enhance how businesses attain, analyze and use data, citing \"Watson's Law\" which predicts an exponential shift as the convergence of AI and data continues to increase, in much the same way that Moore's law predicted continued exponential growth in microprocessor power.","But with Watson's Law, Rometty also warned of the potential for data to be misused and exposed. \"I can't have that conversation [about AI and data] without also covering this,\" she said. \"It will be the greatest opportunity of our time, but it has the potential to be the greatest issue of our time.\"","Rometty said \"data trust and responsibility\" will become even more crucial if AI advances as predicted by Watson's Law and more companies compile massive amounts of data on users and customers. \"All of us have to act, not just tech companies,\" she said. \"In the end I think we'll all be judged not just by how we use data…but if we're a data steward.\"","Rometty was joined on stage by IBM customers who echoed the importance of proper data usage and protection in the context of Watson's Law. Dave McKay, president and CEO of the Royal Bank of Canada, which uses IBM's cognitive and A.I. offerings, said companies need to be clear about what customer data is being used and how it's being used. \"You have to be clear and say 'We think we create value if you share this information but we'll keep it within these walls',\" McKay said. \"But it has to be relevant and it has to create value to the customer at the end of the day.\"","McKay also acknowledged that enterprises in general haven't fostered a great deal of confidence in their ability to be good data stewards. \"We're stressed right now in that trust factor,\" he said. \"And I think institutions that truly live that trust will prosper in the future.","Lowell McAdam chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications, which also uses several Watson-driven services, told the audience that once a company loses the trust of its customers, \"you're never going to get it back.","\"We've made very clear pledges to our customers that we will not use your data in any way that we haven't made clear to you and that gives you the opportunity to opt in,\" McAdam said. \"We've seen the things that are going on in [Silicon] Valley now with companies and how they're using data. We don't ever want to be in that position.\"","While the telecom giant did find itself in a similar position in 2013 after Edward Snowden revealed that the company was delivering phone records to the National Security Agency under a secret court order, Rometty and McAdam were referencing non-government related abuses of data. And while none of the speakers during IBM Think's keynote sessions mentioned Facebook by name, it's clear the social media giant's recent controversy regarding exposed user data had cast a shadow over the proceedings.","Protecting data in the age of Watson's Law","At IBM Think, Big Blue executives discussed the different ways the company keeps its ever-growing \"data lake\" from being misused or tapped by unauthorized third parties. During her keynote, Rometty emphasized the company's data principles for \"the era of data and A.I.,\" which state that A.I.'s purpose is to augment man and machine rather than just machines; that IBM's business model is \"not about distributing data or in fact monetizing it\"; and that IBM applies \"advanced security\" to protect that data, whether it's pervasive encryption or future projects such as quantum-resistant encryption.","Dinesh Nirmal, vice president of IBM Analytics Development, told SearchSecurity the company has taken several steps in recent years to better monitor and regulate data as the company's A.I. technology has grown. Those efforts included the hiring of Inderpal Bhandari in 2015 as IBM's first global chief data officer and the examination of how IBM handled the data of its own employees internally in order to develop more effective policies.","\"We looked at our own data lake, which has information from hundreds of thousands of employees over the course of 100-plus years,\" Nirmal said. \"The strategy for protecting data lakes is partially policy-based – restricting how data is used, who can access it and things like that – but policies don't matter unless there is technology behind them to enforce the policies, and there is.\"","IBM said it's also taken a careful approach with API access. For example, IBM executives were asked during a press conference if the recent Facebook data exposure, which saw a third party extract unauthorized data via an API provided to it by Facebook, had caused Big Blue to rethink how it allows customers to access its A.I.-driven data. David Kenny, senior vice president of IBM Watson and Cloud Platforms, said it hasn't changed IBM's approach because Watson's APIs provide access from applications to the A.I. service and not to the underlying data. Customers, he said, will possess their own data within their environments, but they are unable to reach into the A.I. services and touch other data.","Join the conversation","1 comment","Register","I agree to TechTarget’s Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and the transfer of my information to the United States for processing to provide me with relevant information as described in our Privacy Policy.","Please check the box if you want to proceed.","I agree to my information being processed by TechTarget and its Partners to contact me via phone, email, or other means regarding information relevant to my professional interests.

(Jeff Roberson/AP)","ByDonald E. Graham","March 26","Donald E. Graham, chairman of Graham Holdings Company, was publisher of The Washington Post from 1979 to 2001.","The problems at Facebook and others, real and perceived, at Google, Amazon and Apple have led to an easy consensus: The large technology companies should be regulated. When ­Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Elizabeth ­Warren ­ (D-Mass.) call for the same thing, it is possible that even in Washington — The City Where Nothing Happens — Congress will decide that technology companies must be regulated.","Such an outcome would be a bad mistake — bad for the companies, of course, but also bad for us, their users, and bad for the country.","I do not pretend to be unbiased in writing this. While I am about as tech-savvy as your average 72-year-old , I met Mark Zuckerberg when he was 20, and spent six years on Facebook’s board. As publisher and later chairman of The Post, I watched the rise of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, sometimes with hope, sometimes with awe and sometimes with horror for what it meant to The Post’s business.","To start with the basics: The big technology companies ought to obey the laws that apply to all businesses. They should pay their taxes and comply with antitrust laws. If they make mistakes, they should admit them quickly and act transparently to fix them. Facebook, in particular, faces a huge challenge in convincing its users that they can trust it to safeguard their data.","So why not regulate these companies more? First: Google and Facebook are platforms where a great deal of today’s political speech and reporting of news takes place, and regulation is an inherently political act. If you want a Technology Company Regulation Commission, its chairman and its members will be appointed by presidents and will reflect their policies.","Do presidents really play a role in regulation or enforcement? Well, you can listen to the Watergate tapes and hear President ­Richard Nixon direct his advisers John Dean and H.R. Haldeman to use the Federal Communications Commission’s regulatory process to take away TV stations owned by The Washington Post Co. Challenges to stations’ licenses by Nixon supporters did ensue and, had Nixon not resigned, they would have been heard by an FCC led by the former chairman of the Republican National Committee . It is difficult to convince me that regulation is apolitical.","If you want Google, Facebook and other tech companies regulated, you are asking for a system in which President Trump — or (perhaps in the future) President Elizabeth Warren — plays a role in deciding what goes on your Facebook page or what flows from your Google search. Is that really what you want?","And how do you argue that government should be able to regulate speech on YouTube but not your own speech, or that of The Post?","Second: I worked in regulated industries for years, and regulation can be fairly described as odd. Regulators often do not or cannot talk face-to-face with those being regulated to understand the consequences of what they are doing. The conversation is conducted through lawyers on both sides. Is there a set of regulators in Washington who would understand how Google or Facebook is put together?","Facebook and Google argue they have one goal in their principal businesses: innovating to satisfy their customers. Regulation introduces a different goal: not offending the regulators. Technology companies must move fast; regulation slows things down, sometimes drastically. Almost inevitably, this hurts a company’s performance. Money, time and, above all, management attention that might be focused on innovation and satisfying customers are focused elsewhere.","From the day it began accepting advertising, Facebook has walked a line, sometimes carefully, sometimes not. It promised advertisers the ability to target ads at users who were interested in their products; it promised users that their data would be private. Careful compromises should have been able to maintain trust with both sets of users.","The most important control over Facebook — greater than anything governments could come up with — is the ability of its users to quit. Zuckerberg has a huge incentive to keep our data private and to prove that Facebook has done so (the standards that permitted Cambridge Analytica to access user data were changed three years ago). Facebook needs to go to any possible length to convince its irritated users that it can be trusted.","Taken together, the big tech companies constitute a rare area where America leads the world. If you don’t believe they are important to the country, look at how they are treated elsewhere. In Europe, the home of many unsuccessful competitors, they are fined and regulated not because they are lawbreakers, but because they are American. And in China, Facebook and Google — as well as Twitter, YouTube and Wikipedia — are banned because they encourage free speech and free thought.","Instead, the Chinese have created massive competitors such as Tencent and Baidu, sheltered from Western competition in their enormous home market. If Google and Facebook slow down — remember that most of the world’s users are outside the United States — these competitors will easily pass them by.","Will it be an aid to your privacy to search on Baidu or share on Tencent? I don’t think so.","I hope the technology companies are wise enough to take the measures needed to convince users that they care about their privacy. And I hope our country is wise enough not to regulate them."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Signal is a free, open-source app that lets you make calls and send texts securely with end-to-end encryption. Although it lacks features like stickers and built-in apps, it has other features like group chat and disappearing messages.","Instagram","A lot of people are deleting Facebook and announcing that they’re moving to Instagram.

But to get there he’ll have to battle the spammers, hackers, and trolls who exploit and hijack groups to make money or sow chaos.","One week after the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, those searching on Facebook for information about the upcoming March for Our Lives were likely to be shown an active group with more than 50,000 members.","Called “March for Our Lives 2018 Official,” it appeared to be one of the best places to get details about the event and connect with others interested in gun control. But those who joined the group soon found themselves puzzled. The admins often posted pro-gun information and unrelated memes and mocked those who posted about gun control.","“I'm a retired federal law enforcement special agent. There is and never has been any reason for a civilian to have a high-capacity high velocity weapon,” posted one member on Feb. 20.","“Shutup fed and stop trying to spread your NWO BS,” was the top reply, which came from one of the group’s admins. (NWO is a reference to the “new world order” conspiracy theory.)","A few days later the group’s name was changed to “Kim Jong Un Fan Club,” and members continued to wonder what was going on.","The simple answer is they were being trolled. The more complicated one is that while Facebook groups may offer a positive experience for millions of people around the world, they have also become a global honeypot of spam, fake news, conspiracies, health misinformation, harassment, hacking, trolling, scams, and other threats to users, according to reporting by BuzzFeed News, findings from researchers, and the recent indictment of 13 Russians for their alleged efforts to interfere in the US election.","“This vision could backfire terribly: an increase in the weight of ‘groups’ means reinforcement of Facebook’s worst features — cognitive bubbles — where users are kept in silos fueled by a torrent of fake news and extremism,” wrote Frederic Filloux, coauthor of the influential weekly media commentary newsletter Monday Note.","“Propagandists and spammers need to amass an audience, and groups serve that up on a platter. There’s no need to run an ad campaign to find people receptive to your message if you can simply join relevant groups and start posting,” she said.","To her point, the recent indictment of the 13 Russians repeatedly cited Facebook groups as a focus of workers at the Internet Research Agency.","“By 2016, the size of many organization-controlled groups had grown to hundreds of thousands of online followers,” the indictment said.","One part of the Russian effort on Facebook left unmentioned in the Mueller indictment — and that has not previously been reported — is that Facebook’s group recommendation system encouraged fans of troll-run pages such as Blactivist and Heart of Texas to organize themselves into groups based on their shared affinity for a page. To this day there remain many groups with automatically generated names such as “Friends Who Like Blacktivist” or “Friends Who Like Heart of Texas.” These groups appear to be small and inactive, but the fact remains that Facebook prompted Americans to organize into fan groups of Russian troll pages.","There’s no question that groups offer value to many Facebook users. They keep friends and former classmates close, and played a key role in helping organize the West Virginia teachers’ strike. They are the basis for a thriving global community of buy, sell, and barter networks. Groups were used to raise money for victims of the Las Vegas shooting, and help provide support to, and prevent suicide among, US military personnel. Facebook groups can restrict membership by being designated “secret” or “closed,” and as a result people often share deeply personal information and experiences because they feel protected from the prying eyes of search engines and the public at large.","That’s the case for Female IN, a secret Facebook group that today boasts a membership of more than 1.5 million women around the world. It was created by Lola Omolola, a Nigerian-born journalist now living in Chicago. She started it after more than 250 schoolgirls were kidnapped by a terrorist group in Nigeria. Many of the women in the group live in, or are originally from, African countries. But Omolola said it has grown to include women from other parts of the world.","Secret groups like FIN are completely invisible to anyone who is not a member, and Facebook users can only join if they are invited by a current member. This is different from closed groups, which can be found via search, show up on user profiles, and enable anyone to request to be added to the group.","“We discuss everything from everyday day stuff like your children, your healthcare, and your individual interactions with people. We go from there to talking about domestic violence. People are sharing in real time what happens at their homes,” Omolola told BuzzFeed News in an interview facilitated by Facebook’s PR team. “Generally we are very actively and thoughtfully healing a population of women who are used to being silenced, and whose voices have never really historically mean that much.”","But even a group that Facebook itself points to as an example of the product’s value has to wage a battle against bad actors. Omolola and other FIN admins work constantly to keep men and spammers out of the group. They have to warn members about imposter FIN groups on Facebook that try to leverage her group’s success and brand among women. A post to the public FIN Facebook page from last fall warned women of a “FAKE FIN run by A MAN!!!”","“Some people try to use the [FIN] name to get a lot of people to their groups,” Omolola said. “We have contacted Facebook and Facebook knows about it, and are working on ways to protect us.”","Omolola says she working on trademarking the group’s name so she can ask Facebook can enforce her trademark and take imposter groups down faster. Right now, it’s mostly up to her and her members to go into fake FIN groups and warn people that it’s a scam.","Jennifer Dulski, the head of groups and community at Facebook, told BuzzFeed News that there is now a dedicated “integrity” team for groups, which includes people who specialize in security, product, machine learning, and content moderation. She pointed to new tools launched last year that help admins screen and easily remove members, and that lets admins clearly state the rules of a given group on its About page. (Omolola said these new features are all big time savers.)","“There is some negative content and behavior happening on Facebook, including in groups, and we take that really seriously,” Dulski said.","She emphasized that the the experience for most users is positive.","“It’s amazing to see what is actually happening in Facebook groups, and the vast majority of of activity and content in these groups is not only positive but also meaningful for the people involved in them.”","DiResta sees a parallel, suggesting groups are at the same stage pages and the News Feed were prior to Facebook’s 2016 wake-up call about fake news: rife with manipulation and lacking proper oversight.","“We need to avoid a repeat of the kind of persuasive manipulation we saw on pages, so Facebook needs to be pay attention to these issues as they continue to increase their emphasis on groups,” DiResta said.","That emphasis on groups is now a cornerstone of Zuckerberg’s vision for the company and product. Last summer he announced an ambitious goal to drastically increase the number of Facebook users in “meaningful” groups from 100 to 1 billion.","“If we can do this, it will not only turn around the whole decline in community membership we've seen for decades, it will start to strengthen our social fabric and bring the world closer together,” he said in a speech at Facebook’s first Community Summit last summer.","But to get to a billion, Facebook will have to acknowledge and battle the spammers, hackers, and trolls who constantly exploit, take over, and buy and sell groups in order to make money or sow chaos. It will also have to confront the fact that its own recommendation engine at times pushes users into conspiracy theorist groups, or into those geared toward trolling, harassment, or illicit online activity.","The global exploitation of groups","As the 2016 election moved into its final stretch, members of a Facebook group called Republicans Suck suddenly experienced an influx of new members who spammed the group with links to questionable stories on websites they’d never heard of.","Bobby Ison, a Kentucky man who was member of the group, told BuzzFeed News that he noticed the administrators and moderators of the group began to change and “some of them were obvious foreign accounts. Eastern European countries. Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia.”","Ison said he and others learned that the Facebook account of one of the group’s original admins had been hacked. With control of the admin’s Facebook profile, the hackers were then able to add whoever they wanted as admins, and remove the group’s original leaders.","“When they got his [account], they booted the other admins, and moved more of theirs in,” Ison said. “It was rather sad to witness.” (The admin whose account Ison said was hacked did not respond to inquiries from BuzzFeed News.)","Eventually, former admins and members fled to start a new, closed group called","“As some of you know, the old REPUBLICANS SUCK has been hacked and taken over by hackers and trolls, which is something that is happening in several groups,” reads the pinned message for the group from one of its administrators.","Ison said the old group’s new overseas admins stepped up their spamming efforts in order to drive traffic from the group to their sites, presumably so they could earn ad revenue.","“It turned into a horrible page after they finally took over. Posting some of the most outlandish stories I've seen,” he said.","BuzzFeed News spoke via Facebook Messenger with one of the profiles currently listed as an admin of the group. That account has previously posted online about a Ford van for sale in Macedonia and written posts in Macedonian. Many of the account’s earliest posts in groups were for online moneymaking schemes. The person running the account said they were only added as an admin of the group two months earlier and didn't know anything about the group takeover last year.","“For the first time I hear from you that this group is stolen,” they wrote. They said they are not profiting in any way from the group. (BuzzFeed News could not confirm whether the profile’s name is linked to a real person.)","“We have no interest, we have no profit, we do not do with advertisements,” they said, and offered to make a BuzzFeed News reporter an admin of the group as a sign of goodwill.","“It would not be unusual to request to join 30 to 40 groups at a time, wait a few minutes to get approvals, and then spam links throughout those groups.\"","BuzzFeed News previously documented how political Facebook groups were exploited to spread political fake news to Americans during the 2016 election and beyond. An article published on Election Day revealed that Macedonian spammers used fake profiles to spam Trump and Bernie Sanders groups to generate engagement for their often false pro-Trump stories.","The tactic of spamming groups is by no means restricted to US politics or those targeting US audiences.","Rappler, an independent news website in the Philippines, last month published a story about a seemingly fake Facebook profile that spammed groups with links to websites that carried positive news about President Rodrigo Duterte. At one point the profile took over a fan group for a South Korean actor and changed its name to “President Duterte Supporters.”","Rappler found that the account posted hundreds of links to pro-Duterte news in Facebook groups since last summer. “She had also posted 307 times in various groups linking to a website called ‘Philippine Republic News’ which carries fake stories such as Oprah's support for President Duterte,” the story said.","A report on troll farms and fake news in the Philippines by two researchers included a case study showing that paid trolls tasked with helping win an election “came up with fake profiles and populated a Facebook group dedicated to the city they were trying to win.”","Facebook groups are also an engine of misinformation in Myanmar. Thura, a worker with a Myanmar social media research organisation, told BuzzFeed News by email that “Facebook groups are being used widely to spread hatred.” (BuzzFeed News agreed to conceal his identity due to security and safety concerns related to the work he does in Myanmar.)","Thura said people are using groups to spread hate and misinformation because they’re aware that less of the content posted to pages will reach the News Feed. So they focus on groups as a cheaper and more reliable way to reach people.","“Since Facebook pages do not normally go into News Feed unless they pay ads, groups are a good way to raise visibility of some of the fake news,” Thura wrote. “Groups are also a good strategy for [generating] engagement for a post from a page, meaning once a page posts a content, their network share them in several different groups.”","Spamming fake stories into groups is also the preferred tactic of American fake news publishers. Jestin Coler is a California man who ran more than a dozen early fake news sites such as National Report starting in 2013. He exited the fake news game last year and now says he’s focused on trying to use his experience to help battle online misinformation. Coler told BuzzFeed News that spamming groups was, and continues to be, a key traffic strategy for fake stories — and it’s still not being dealt with by Facebook.","“Joining Facebook groups that are related to the content being promoted, then spamming links throughout those groups using various aliases, is quite effective,” he said. “Members of the group then essentially become ‘bots’ and often share content to their network (outside of the group) creating a more organic-looking campaign.”","Coler said it was standard practice to identify specific Facebook groups related to the topic of a fake story and then join them all at once to enable link spamming.","“It would not be unusual to request to join 30 to 40 groups at a time, wait a few minutes to get approvals, and then spam links throughout those groups,” he said.","His lack of knowledge of American pop culture also caused him to share the link in a group dedicated to the TV show It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He apparently thought it was a group focused on the city. (He did not reply to requests for comment at the time.) One town in Kosovo is also home to a network of groups that spread fake news to Americans, according to a recent report by Media Matters.","Facebook’s intention to give even more visibility to group content in the News Feed will now make this tactic even more appealing. It could also result in more takeovers of groups. There’s evidence this is already happening.","Two weeks after Facebook announced its latest News Feed algorithm changes, former admins and members of “Mystic Fire Native Heart,” a group with tens of thousands of members, began posting to warn that it had been taken over by hackers from Eastern Europe.","Keyword squatting and targeted harassment","Another tactic that could become more frequent with the elevation of groups by Facebook is what researcher Joan Donovan calls “keyword squatting.” The group that changed its name to “March for Our Lives 2018 Official” in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, is a perfect example. That group has over time gained tens of thousands of members thanks to the admins changing its title to different topical names that are likely to attract new members.","When Stephen Hawking died last week the group changed its name to “RIP STEPHEN HAWKING 2018” and as a result showed up as a top three result in a groups search for “stephen hawking.”","Facebook","“This is a feature that they have learned to leverage and you can imagine if they have learned to do it there are hundreds if not thousands of other groups changing the keyword weekly in order to get attention,” said Donovan, who leads the media manipulation project for the research institute Data & Society. (Facebook declined to comment on that group’s tactics.)","Thura said keyword squatting is a common tactic in Myanmar, too. People will start a Facebook group with a topic that has broad appeal and is not connected to news. Then, once it’s gained enough members, the admins switch its name and start sharing false stories.","“The strategy they used often is that they start with a different name and then once they have a large amount of users, they change it to a different name such as ‘Let’s Share News’ group,” Thura said.","Dulski, who oversees groups at Facebook, said the company has invested in new tools to enable group members to report content that may violate the terms of service, or a group’s specific rules.","“One is tool for members to report posts that might be violating the rules, and they can report this to the admins of the group and to Facebook,” she said. “This allows admins to quickly and easily review and keep bad content from appearing.”","In cases of hate speech or offensive content, Dilski said Facebook uses machine learning to automatically flag posts that may be violating the terms of service, regardless of whether people report it or not.","Thura said he and other have found it’s often pointless to flag content or complain to group admins about fake news since they’re often the ones spreading it.","There are in fact groups that exist solely to engage in activities that violate Facebook’s terms of service. One group, Republic of Kekistan, amassed more than 30,000 members before being removed by Facebook earlier this year. BuzzFeed News joined the group last year and watched as members coordinated online harassment campaigns, most of which were targeted at trans women and left-leaning Facebook pages. The group was also home to hate speech, such as a post where one member posted a photo of a handgun and asked, \"What kind of Muslim repellant do y'all carry?\"","Facebook","The process for planning raids was simple: One group member shared a link to a piece of content they didn’t agree with and added the word “raid” to signal like-minded members to flood the comments of the content in question with nasty, often hate-filled messages and other types of trolling. Some calls for raids went unnoticed by the rest of the group, but others funneled dozens of hateful comments to unsuspecting victims.","At one point, a post in the group asked members to “raid the comments” of a fundraising post for the family of Heather Heyer, the woman who was killed during the Charlottesville demonstrations last year. Another post encouraged members to post laughing reactions to a Facebook post about a trans teen who committed suicide (The group’s description page at one point warned members, “No raid posts allowed. The safety of the nation must be guarded against retaliatory attacks.” But it appeared that policy was enforced loosely, if at all.)","BuzzFeed News","Planning coordinated online attacks is against Facebook policy, but members of Republic of Kekistan seemingly stayed under Facebook’s radar and went unpunished for months. Sophie Labelle, a cartoonist from Montreal and a trans woman, was targeted last May. Labelle writes a web comic called Assigned Male and is the author of several comic books about being trans. Labelle told BuzzFeed News she’s used to the online harassment that comes with being a trans public figure, but this was an extreme case.","Trolls posted her home address online and she had to move. Labelle said her roommate, who’s also trans, felt threatened too. The trolls also targeted a bookstore hosting her launch and as a result it was canceled. (That raid worked out in Labelle's favor: the added attention helped her book sell out its first printing.)","“I feel pretty powerless. It’s kind of a given that when you show support to me it makes you a target,” she said.","Labelle said there are conspiracy theories about her online and even her readers are sometimes targeted if they leave a comment on one of her social media posts.","Labelle suspects Republic of Kekistan was behind the May harassment, but she does not know for sure. As payback, her supporters decided to band together to coordinate mass-reporting of the Facebook group for violating the platform’s terms of service, and Facebook eventually shut it down temporarily that same month. The group reemerged at some point after the ban and was active again as recently as January, according to an online archive. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment about when and why Republic of Kekistan was taken offline.","A marketplace of black hat groups services","Groups have become attractive enough for both legitimate and bad actors that there’s now a flourishing online marketplace of apps and services related to exploiting them.","There are multiple software apps that can automate posting links in groups and also automate the process of joining groups and inviting other profiles into them. For a small fee, you can buy new members to make your group seem more popular than it is, pay to spam a link of your choosing in groups with large numbers of members to try to drive traffic, or hire someone to go into a group and capture the email addresses of members in order to enable further spamming and targeting.","All of the aforementioned services violate Facebook’s terms of service, but they are easily found with a simple online search, or by going to a freelancing site such as Fiverr. Many of these services are offered by people based in countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India.","“Looking for a Facebook promotion expert to help you post and promote your products, services to millions of real and active Facebook group members ???” read one recent Fiverr ad. “Search no more.I am here to give you full expert service that will promote your ads or links to about 40 million real and active Facebook group members.”","To learn how these providers add hundreds or thousands of members to groups, BuzzFeed News purchased a total of 6,000 members for three groups it set up. One person on Fiverr charged $6 to provide 5,000 members for a group. BuzzFeed News then purchased two more sets of 500 members from different providers that were found by simply searching Google for “buy facebook group members.”","People all over Facebook are being involuntarily added to groups because at some point they unknowingly friended a dubious online marketer.","One company charged $25 to add 500 members that were located in the US or UK. Another charged just $6 for 500 members that were not accounts specifically based in those two countries. In each case the process was the same: After the order was placed BuzzFeed News was contacted by email or Facebook and told to make a specific Facebook profile an administrator of the group. Once done, the administrator began quickly adding other Facebook accounts to the group. Suddenly these newly created groups appeared more popular than they were, and were likely to show up higher in search results on Facebook.","The profiles added to the groups appeared to belong to real people, though a sampling of some of them found they were inactive for a year or two. The orders that did not specify US and UK profiles saw accounts added primarily from Bangladesh and India.","A man in Pakistan who helped fulfil one of the orders told BuzzFeed News in a Facebook Messenger chat that he could easily add large numbers of profiles to any group in a short amount of time.","“I do even 500,000 members in single group easily,” he said.","He said the accounts he adds to a group belong to real people. The key is that he controls many Facebook accounts that he uses to friend real people. Once two accounts are friends, Facebook easily allows one profile to add the other into a public group without requiring their permission. (In the case of closed and secret groups, the invited profile must accept the request.)","The result is that people all over Facebook are being involuntarily added to groups because at some point they unknowingly friended a dubious online marketer.","The man told BuzzFeed News he uses a computer programming script to automatically add members in batches of 500 to 700. If he does more than that at a time he risks being banned by Facebook. But that limit appears to do little to deter those selling group members. (Once he saw that the BuzzFeed News reporter had a verified Facebook profile he offered to pay to get profiles he controls verified.)","Facebook","Facebook groups themselves are also places to purchase black-hat online marketing services. BuzzFeed News joined a group dedicated to Google’s AdSense advertising network and saw a post from an admin that listed his services. One item for sale? Facebook groups.","“I have facebook trade and sell groups for sale 20k to 40k members,” he wrote.","Radicalization by the recommendation engine","DiResta, the security researcher, first saw the risks of groups in 2015 while researching health conspiracy content and communities on social networks. She joined anti-vaccine parenting groups on Facebook and watched as well-meaning parents became increasingly radicalized in their views of Western medicine. She also saw false and misleading links spread quickly within groups.","DiResta also documented how group members coordinated the sharing of specific links on Twitter and other platforms to create the impression of an outpouring of support for a specific point of view. “They didn’t have bots but they were effectively replicating the function of bots,” DiResta said. “They were using these groups to coordinate and spread these messages.”","Facebook’s recommendation system also began its own process of algorithmic radicalization. DiResta noticed that as her account became more involved in anti-vax groups Facebook shifted the kind of groups it recommended to her. She was soon being shown groups about chemtrails, fluoride conspiracies, and flat Earth. As the 2016 election moved into its final stretch, Facebook suggested she join groups dedicated to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. DiResta calls it “radicalization via the recommendation engine.”","She provided two screenshots to BuzzFeed News, both taken in December 2016, that show Pizzagate group recommendations for her profile. The largest group being pitched had more than 12,000 members at the time.","Similarly, after BuzzFeed News joined the group dedicated to gaming and cheating AdSense, Facebook’s recommendation engine surfaced a list of groups dedicated to the same topics, as if to say, “We see you enjoy ad and click fraud. Try these groups to learn more.”","Facebook also uses data about groups membership to recommend new friends. At the same time that the groups recommendation engine can push people further to the fringe, Facebook will suggest new friends who reinforce these perspectives.","Another concern for DiResta is how secret groups are used to further the radicalization process. When she was researching the anti-vax community she found it was easy to join open and closed groups. But she soon discovered that people used secret groups to exchange the most sensitive information and even engage in illegal activity.","“People would go into a group and say, ‘Hey, I need to get a medical exemption [for vaccines] for my kid’ and someone would say, ‘Hang on, I’ll DM you.’ Then gradually they recruit you into a secret group,” she said. “There was a whole underground network of information sharing around which doctors to go to in order to get fraudulent medical exemptions.”","DiResta said Facebook must find a way to strike a balance between letting people search for and talk about the topics they want without actively radicalizing or polarizing them.","“People have a right to search for Pizzagate and join Pizzagate groups, yes,” she said. “But for Facebook to be continuously, proactively surfacing these types of groups to people, that I think is where the ethics of the recommender system is insufficiently developed right now.”","“At a minimum, it needs to be studying how often people respond to these suggestions, and how groups may be impacting polarization,” she said. “Only Facebook has this data.”","Tellingly, even those who are happily engaging in conspiracy theory groups on Facebook also express frustration with how the product is being exploited. Last month a member of the PizzagateUncompromised group (7,500 members) posted a warning.","Facebook","“The groups Exposing the Rothschilds and Pizzagate Exposed were hijacked,” he wrote.","It happened the same way that “Republicans Suck” and “Mystic Fire Native Heart” were taken over.","“It happens in a lot of groups,” replied one person. “Time to look for some good alternatives to FB imo.” ●","Craig Silverman is a media editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in Toronto."],"isopubdate":""}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}
{"originalurl":"https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/28/facebook-api-shut-down/","title":"Facebook Is Shutting Down Its API For Giving Your Friends’ Data To Apps – TechCrunch","text":["Facebook Is Shutting Down Its API For Giving Your Friends’ Data To Apps","It was always kind of shady that Facebook let you volunteer your friends’ status updates, check-ins, location, interests and more to third-party apps. While this let developers build powerful, personalized products, the privacy concerns led Facebook to announce at F8 2014 that it would shut down the Friends data API in a year. Now that time has come, with the forced migration to Graph API v2.0 leading to the friends’ data API shutting down, and a few other changes happening on April 30.","Today Facebook assembled journalists in San Francisco to discuss the rhetoric behind the change. All apps created since April 20, 2014, already have the new systems, so you’ve probably seen them in the wild. But all new developers must comply with updated APIs, or their connection to Facebook will stop working.","Job Fusion will have to shut down its referral engine","Some users will see it as a positive move that returns control of personal data to its rightful owners. Just because you’re friends with someone, doesn’t mean you necessarily trust their judgment about what developers are safe to deal with. Now, each user will control their own data destiny.","Along with the year notice, Facebook reviewed 5,000 of the top apps and sent them feedback about how their app will perform after the change. Its goal has been to minimize the impact on users.","Facebook’s Simon Cross told reporters that Mark Zuckerberg said one of Facebook’s new slogans is ‘People First’, because “if people don’t feel comfortable using Facebook and specifically logging in Facebook and using Facebook in apps, we don’t have a platform, we don’t have developers.”","To inform its new policies, Facebook did extensive in-person research, asking users how they felt about their privacy when they used Facebook with apps. It came away believing that to ensure the long-term health of the ecosystem, it has to give users confidence in how their app privacy is handled. When people are confident, “they feel happier and use our stuff more, and that’s what we’re tying to achieve” says Cross.","On the other hand, some developers will have significantly change how their apps work, or turn them off altogether. For example, Job Fusion relied on the ability to pull where a user’s friends work to show them job openings at those companies. Now Job Fusion is shutting down its referral engine, though it will continue operating in different ways. Others going dark or that already have due to the change include CareerSonar, Jobs With Friends, and adzuna Connect.","Along with the friends data API change, Facebook is now requiring all apps to use its new login system, which gives users more granular control over what data they give developers. Previously, users provided all their data and permissions in two big screens. One for all personal info and one for the ability for an app to post to Facebook on your behalf.","Now on the log-in screen, developers must include an “Edit the info you provide” link, which opens a checklist of all the data and permissions they’re asking for, including friend list, Likes, email address, and the ability to post to the News Feed. Users can tap the checkmarks to deny certain permissions.","Lastly, Facebook has now instituted Login Review, where a team of its employees audit any app that requires more than the basic data of someone’s public profile, list of friends, and email address. The Login Review team has now checked over 40,000 apps, and from the experience, created new, more specific permissions so developers don’t have to ask for more than they need. Facebook revealed that apps now ask an average of 50 percent fewer permissions than before.","So what does April 30 mean for users? In some cases, nothing. Apps that don’t need extra permissions and that function if they’re missing some like your email address will automatically get the new login systems and will work normally, and users won’t have to log back in. If a developer is significantly changing an app or needs more permissions, users may need to log back in, or the app might perform weirdly or show roadblock error messages. And some apps may simply cease to exist.","Apps don’t have to delete data they’ve already pulled. If someone gave your data to an app, it could go on using it. However, if you request that a developer delete your data, it has to. However, how you submit those requests could be through a form, via email, or in other ways that vary app to app. You can also always go to your App Privacy Settings and remove permissions for an app to pull more data about you in the future.","Overall, the changes could boost confidence in Facebook’s platform and the social network itself, which has struggled in the past with a reputation for spotty privacy. Cross says the conversion rate on people logging in with Facebook has increased 11 percent and believes this means “More people feel comfortable logging in with Facebook.”","Facebook’s never been shy about prioritizing users over developers and advertisers. It’s repeatedly reduced app virality to protect users’ feeds from spam, and denied advertiser requests for more flashy, site takeover-style ads. Facebook knows that if it burns users now, usage will wither, and all developers will get hurt.","And while developers might not like the changes, Facebook tried to give them as much warning as possible."],"isopubdate":"2015-04-28"}

Plus, non-user contacts were also leaked. UPDATED with Facebook responses (inline).","The security researchers who found Facebook's shadow profiles vulnerability have compared their numbers to what Facebook told its users in emails, and the numbers don't match.","They say Facebook told users the data exposure is much less than what the researchers found, and the researchers also say Facebook is hoarding non-user contact information — seen when it was also shared and exposed in the leak.","Since at least 2012, Facebook users who used the Download Your Information (DYI) tool to get their data history record also got an address book with contacts users had never provided to Facebook.","Facebook explained the issue to ZDNet Sunday after user anger exploded — saying that when a Facebook user uploads an address book, the social network obtains all contacts in the user's database and saves all of them.","Users are still furious and were unaware that their not-for-sharing, offsite phone numbers and email addresses are being collected, stored, secretly matched to them (and now accidentally shared) by Facebook.","In its Friday email, Facebook disclosed the security and privacy flaw to users, but no one knew that Facebook's email wasn't telling the whole story — except security researcher Michael Fury (who originally found the vulnerability) and colleagues at Packet Storm Security (and anyone quietly exploiting the data breach).","Because Packet Storm had prior test data verifying the leak, they were able to compare what they knew was actually being revealed in the DYI reports against what Facebook reported to its users via email — as well as what Facebook told the press.","For another individual, they only told him about 3 out of 7 pieces of data were disclosed.","It does not appear that they will take any extra steps at this point to explain the real magnitude of the exposure and we suspect the numbers are much higher.","The statement that \"No other info about you was shown\" seems to be a red herring. We asked Facebook what this means for non-Facebook-users who had their information also disclosed.","The answer was simple — they were not contacted and the information was not reported. As a billion users upload their contacts, their associates on and off of Facebook will all become stored and correlated.","At this point, Facebook may have email addresses and phone numbers on everyone, Facebook user or not.","When reached for comment about Packet Storm Security's \"Math of the Aftermath\" post, Facebook declined to comment saying that all it had to say on the matter was in its Friday blog post - a repeat of the information Packet Storm is contradicting.","The social network said that it obtains and matches the offsite-sourced data to user profiles — creating shadow profiles — \"to better create friend suggestions\" for the user.","This appears to be the first time Facebook has publicly admitted that users' shadow profiles contain more than native data (such as posts or information you deleted but are retained by Facebook) and also contain data that Facebook is harvesting from other users.","After last week's experience, Packet Storm believes that Facebook is compiling \"frightening\" shadow profile \"dossiers on everyone possible\" — including people without Facebook accounts.","When you open the downloaded archive, there is a file inside called addressbook.html. This file is supposed to house the contact information you uploaded.","However, due to a flaw in how Facebook implemented this, it also housed contact information from other uploads other users have performed for the same person, provided you had one piece of matching data, effectively building large dossiers on people.","In our testing, we found that uploading one public email address for an individual could reap a dozen additional pieces of contact information. It should also be noted that the collection of this information goes for all of the data uploaded, regardless of whether or not your contacts are Facebook users.","(...) Our first question asked that, in the name of common decency and privacy, would Facebook ever commit to automatically discarding information of individuals that do not have a known Facebook account?","Their response was essentially that they think of [all] contacts imported by a [single] user as the user's data and they [Facebook] are allowed to do with it what they want.","Disturbingly, Facebook declined to answer many of Packet Storm's crucial questions, and at one point Facebook actually told Packet Storm that Facebook stood on First Amendment rights with this data collection policy.","The policy being that in this area, your data is not yours; it belongs to your friends, and by its rules your friends — or merely people you know — have more control over your data than you do.","Facebook's DYI history feature rolled out October 2010 to more than 500 million Facebook users over the span of a number of months. Lawyers wrote about using DYI as a discovery tool for court cases, for both clients and adversaries.","A month after Facebook's DYI history download tool was rolled out to 500 million users, November 2011, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) settled its complaint with Facebook regarding changes the site made in 2009 in regard to user privacy that the Federal government called “unfair and deceptive.”","According to the 2011 agreement, Facebook: “shall not misrepresent in any manner, expressly or by implication, the extent to which it maintains the privacy or security of covered information.”","In addition, Facebook was ordered \"to notify users and obtain their consent before sharing any information\" that “materially exceeds the restrictions imposed by a user’s privacy setting.”","This meant that Facebook would need users to consent before it shares their data in a way that is different from how users initially agreed.","Unfortunately, it didn't say anything about data or information Facebook obtains from a user's friends, retained and shadow-profiled under the banner of \"making better friend recommendations.\"","In December 2011, Max Schrems of Vienna, Austria, went a step further than downloading his own information and sent a formal request to Facebook citing European law and asked for his data. He received a CD with 1,222 files.","As of June 2013, there are 1.11 billion Facebook users, with 665 million active daily. Its 2012 revenue was $5.09 billion. The number of people who utilized the Download Your Information tool in 2012 is unknown; when reached for comment on frequency of use, Facebook told ZDNet the DYI numbers are not made available publicly.","We will likely never know how many people obtained Facebook's shadow profile data on others.","In their most recent post, Packet Storm cautioned that beyond the egregious privacy violations in Facebook's claims to ownership of data on users not obtained with their consent, or the dossiers being built on people who aren't on Facebook:","We may never know the true numbers surrounding the disclosure but the liability of housing this additional data appears obvious.","Governments aside, history shows that Facebook has been successfully targeted by Chinese hackers and known malicious hackers.","Thank You","By registering you become a member of the CBS Interactive family of sites and you have read and agree to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Video Services Policy.

The share plunge erased $5billion from the net worth of Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg as calls for investigations came on both sides of the Atlantic after Facebook responded to the explosive reports of misuse of its data by suspending the account of Cambridge Analytica, a British firm hired by Trump’s 2016 campaign.","Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy called for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to appear before Congress, along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter. The two lawmakers said the companies “have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data” and that the lack of oversight “raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights.”","Senator Ron Wyden asked Facebook to provide more information on what he called a “troubling” misuse of private data that could have been used to sway voters. Wyden said he wants to know how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook tools “to weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.”","In Europe, officials voiced similar outrage. Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, called the revelations “horrifying, if confirmed,” and vowed to address concerns in the United States this week. In Britain, parliamentary committee chair Damian Collins said both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook had questions to answer.","“We have repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular whether data had been taken from people without their consent,” Collins said in a statement. Their answers have consistently understated this risk, and have also been misleading to the committee.” Alexander Nix i s chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, which has denied misusing Facebook data for its work on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research said the revelations highlight “systemic problems at Facebook,” but that they won’t immediately impact the social network’s revenues.","INEC: Smartphones can be used at polling units but not inside voting cubicle","The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it has not banned the use of smartphones around polling unit areas.","The electoral body says the rule only comes into effect once a prospective voter enters the voting cubicle to cast his or her vote.","Rotimi Oyekanmi, chief press secretary to INEC chairman, made the clarification in an interview with NAN on Wednesday in Abuja.","He said this while reacting to a statement issued by Uche Secondus, national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), condemning the decision of INEC to ban the use of smartphones at polling booths.","Secondus had alleged that the decision was to perfect a rigging formula for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).","But Oyekanmi said the challenge of vote-buying and selling had prompted many stakeholders to call on INEC to devise innovative ways to tackle the problem.","He said: “In consultation with other stakeholders, the Commission came up with new measures to solve the problem, one of which is to disallow the use of smartphones and other electronic devices in the voting cubicles on election day.","“In other words, INEC is not banning phones around the polling unit area, but the ban takes effect from the moment a prospective voter collects his or her ballot paper and enters into voting cubicle to thumbprint and thereafter drop the folded ballot paper into the ballot box.","“After that, the voter can have access to his or her phone.”","Oyekanmi urged Nigerians to disregard any attempt by any individual or group to politicise what was purely a preventive measure.","Like this:","Related","Report: Over 40% of world’s poorest will live in Nigeria, Congo by 2050","More than 40 percent of “extremely poor people” in the world will be living in Nigeria and DR Congo by 2050, a report by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has revealed.","In the 2018 goalkeepers report released Tuesday, the foundation said by 2050, Nigeria will have 152 million people in extreme poverty out of a projected population of 429 million.","It blamed this on the lack of investment in human capital to correspond with the increasing population growth.","Nigeria is currently the seventh most populous country in the world with an estimated population of 198 million.","The annual report, produced in partnership with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, tracks progress being made on the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs).","In June, Brookings Institution reported that Nigeria had overtaken India as the nation with the highest number of poor people , with 87 million of its citizens in extreme poverty.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had also said in March that Nigerians are getting poorer due to the lack of coherent and comprehensive economic reforms.","The goalkeepers report said while more than a billion in the world have lifted themselves out of extreme poverty since 2000, “extreme poverty is becoming heavily concentrated in sub-Saharan African countries”.","“By 2050, that’s where 86 percent of the extremely poor people in the world are projected to live. The challenge is that within Africa, poverty is concentrating in just a handful of very fast-growing countries,” the report said.","“By 2050, for example, more than 40 percent of the extremely poor people in the world will live in just two countries: Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria. Even within these countries, poverty is still concentrating in certain areas.”","It warned that decades of stunning progress in the fight against poverty and disease may be on the verge of stalling.","This, the report said, is because the poorest parts of the world are growing faster than everywhere else. “If current trend continues, the number of poor people in the world will stop falling – and could even start rising,” it said.","THE WAY OUT","The foundation said to address the poverty crisis, adequate investment would need to be made in young people, especially in areas of education, health and human capital development.","The education and health sectors in Nigeria have suffered neglect over the years. In 2018, N542 billion was earmarked for the education sector while health got N356 billion – out of the N9.1 trillion budget.","“Investing in young people’s health and education is the best way for a country to unlock productivity and innovation; cut poverty, create opportunities and generate prosperity,” the report added.","“The next step is making sure children don’t merely survive but also thrive.”","Like this:","Related","Ayodele Fayose, Ekiti state governor, says he is not afraid of being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).","The anti-graft agency has asked the Nigeria customs service to place the outgoing governor on its watch list, saying he is likely to flee the country in a bid to evade investigation.","Fayose said the action of the EFCC is “petty” and described his investigation as “political”.","In a tweet on Sunday, the governor said the anti-graft agency should expect him after he hands over power on October 16, as he earlier promised.","He wrote: “@officialEFCC putting my name on watch list after notification of my coming is not only political but petty.

But she says it's not so easy. \"You're expected to go and try to research it yourself, read through all the fine print and it's still really elusive,\" she says.","Sponsored By","There are a few things you can do. Let's start with apps. Cambridge Analytica, the firm with ties to the Trump campaign, got user data through a researcher who had an app. Apps are one way your Facebook information winds up outside of its walls.","When you use an app for a game, a survey or anything, you're sharing your data. There is a way to stop this.","Emory Roane of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse says \"users can and certainly should go to their Facebook page and check their connected apps.\"","To do that, go to settings. Click on Apps. Click on Apps, Websites and Plugins. Then you can deny access to all apps by clicking \"disable platform.\" That's straightforward.","If you don't want to deny all apps, you can deny access to certain details about yourself — your religion, your family connections, your interests. Just click on \"Edit\" for \"Apps Others Use.\"","If you don't want Facebook following you around, Roane says, turn off location services. \"If it's asking for your location information all the time or when the app is up,\" he says, \"maybe set it to only when the app is up or disable it altogether.\"","Or just don't use Facebook on your phone. There are other steps you can take, as laid out by public interest organizations like Consumer Reports.","Still, Terrell McSweeny, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, warns users not to be overly confident of keeping all their information private. There are certain details that will be made public on Facebook no matter what you do.","But Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a group that advocates for privacy rights, says Facebook has a reputation for suddenly changing its privacy rules.","\"You could spend all day trying to protect your privacy on Facebook,\" he says. \"You wouldn't be able to go to work or school. You'd be spending your day full time dealing with Facebook.\"","Chester does not think creating better privacy controls is the answer for consumers. \"I think for the average person there's nothing that one can do to protect their privacy,\" he says.","Chester thinks Europe has the right idea. On May 25, a new law there will take effect allowing regulators there \"to be able to come down heavy on Facebook, Google and the others,\" Chester says. The companies will be required \"to get your permission first before they can use your data and create new limits on the ways that Facebook and Google and others operate,\" he adds.","Sponsored By","Chester says it will be interesting to see if the new rules in Europe hurt Facebook profits.","In an interview earlier this week on CNN, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wouldn't object to some regulation of Facebook. But it seems unlikely he'd welcome what's about to happen in Europe."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2pnALew?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.571c582d3ae6","title":"Everything you need to know about the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook debacle - The Washington Post","text":["Everything you need to know about the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook debacle","Late on Friday, Facebook made an unexpected announcement: The data firm Cambridge Analytica, hyped as integral to President Trump’s election, was suspended from the social network for using data collected improperly from Facebook users.","It is a complicated issue that many people might have missed, given the timing of the announcement. With that in mind, here is an overview of the groups involved, what happened — and what it means.","1. What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a data firm that promises its customers insights into consumer or voter behavior.","On the commercial side, that means tools like “audience segmentation” — breaking out advertising audiences into smaller groups — and then targeting advertisements to those groups on “multiple platforms.”","On the political side, it is much the same thing, with one tweak. While advertisers generally target consumers as groups, political campaigns need to target specific people — registered voters receptive to a potential message.","“Combining the precision of data analytics with the insights of behavioral psychology and the best of individually addressable advertising technology,” the company’s website pledges, “you can run a truly end-to-end campaign.” And that is why Cambridge Analytica was created.","Robert Mercer is a prominent conservative donor whose public profile rose sharply over the past few years. He and his daughter Rebekah invested millions in efforts to reshape conservative politics, funding Citizens United, the anti-mainstream-media Media Research Center and Breitbart News.","In 2013, Robert Mercer partnered with a British firm called SCL Group and its elections director Alexander Nix to test SCL’s methodology in Virginia’s governor’s race, as the New York Times reported. Their candidate, Republican Ken Cuccinelli, lost. But the Mercers moved forward with a political data strategy anyway, partnering with Nix to create Cambridge Analytica, which would use SCL’s data and methodology for political work.","2. What prompted the Facebook suspension?","The key part of the Cambridge Analytica sales pitch is that “insights of behavioral psychology” line.","There are lots of data companies that can tell you who’s registered to vote, and there are lots of companies that compile consumer data on those same voters. This, in fact, was an instrumental part of Facebook’s sales pitch to political campaigns (back before it quietly buried that pitch in the wake of questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election). After the 2014 election, we wrote about how Facebook offered campaigns a place to overlap their voter data (who’s registered and basic demographic information) with Facebook’s vast array of data on its users’ behavior. While most firms that collect data on consumer behavior do so by tracking the bread crumbs we leave around our consumer culture — grocery store rewards cards, magazine subscriptions, etc. — Facebook has the advantage that so many Americans tell the company precisely what they like, by quite literally clicking the “like” button.","Facebook’s database of personal information may be the largest in the world, given that nearly a third of the globe has an account with the company. If you are a company looking to provide data services, you would justifiably be jealous of the information Facebook possesses. So Facebook (recognizing an opportunity when it sees it) provides a way for software developers to build on top of their platform, allowing other companies to use their data under certain conditions. It used to be fairly trivial, in fact, for developers to build an application that would then pull a great deal of information from the site, including information about your friends’ activity. In May 2014, the site announced it was tightening that access, beginning the following year.","That change came slightly too late.","To apply its “insights of behavioral psychology” to national politics, as the Mercers intended, the SCL/Cambridge team needed a lot of information about a lot of Americans. According to the Times’s report, a Cambridge employee named Christopher Wylie encountered a researcher at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan built an application that leveraged Facebook’s tools to pull information from the site and then pitched its use using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a tool that allows developers to hire humans (sometimes then referred to as “turkers”) to do simple tasks for small fees.","“The task posted by ‘Global Science Research’ appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would ‘download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.’ ”","Global Science Research was Kogan. Using this method, he gathered information on tens of millions of Americans. (The Times says more than 50 million; other outlets say 30 million.) That information was then used to build out SCL/Cambridge Analytica’s profiles.","In building his Facebook application, Kogan had pledged that his data collection was only for research purposes and that it would remain anonymized — not able to be linked to specific people. When the Guardian reported in late 2015 on the link between Kogan and Cambridge, it prompted Facebook to promise to investigate the situation. (The Guardian’s story was pegged to Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) presidential campaign using Cambridge Analytica for its voter contact efforts. Cruz was strongly supported by the Mercers, who also created well-funded outside groups to promote his candidacy.)","In its statement on Friday announcing the suspensions, Facebook carefully put the blame on Kogan misusing its tools and explained it had demanded in 2015 that Kogan, SCL and Cambridge delete its Facebook data. The suspension was prompted by learning last week — apparently after being contacted by the Times — that Cambridge was still in possession of some of the Facebook data. (The company denies that.)","3. What does Cambridge Analytica’s data actually look like?","It is not clear, but we do have one hint.","A professor at New York’s New School named David Carroll was studying ad targeting when he realized Cambridge’s link with SCL meant the company might be subject to Britain’s broader data-access laws, allowing him to potentially see what data the company had collected on him. In March 2017, he got a response.","It is not clear how Cambridge/SCL developed that profile of Carroll (which he described on Twitter as “accurate”), but one can see how Facebook data might help inform those categories.","One can also see how, once the profile was developed, the Facebook data underlying it would become unnecessary. It is as though you sneaked a peek at the secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken and then developed your own recipe based on it. You may not be in possession of the recipe, but that is sort of beside the point.","4. Where does the Trump campaign fit into this?","Trump’s digital team was run by Brad Parscale, who last month was named campaign manager for Trump’s 2020 effort. Trump’s general election campaign was slow to get geared up after the primary, and, by mid-2016, there was a debate over how to invest in digital marketing. Bolstered by Parscale’s advocacy (and Jared Kushner’s championing) the campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, over then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s apparent objections. The decision may have been made easier, too, by Cambridge/SCL’s role in the successful Brexit campaign in Britain the same month.","As noted above, the Mercers had been hoping Cruz would be the Republican nominee. Once Trump won the Republican nomination, though, they shifted their focus. (The extent to which the hiring of Cambridge Analytica greased that transition is not clear.) They were reportedly instrumental in the August 2016 overhaul of Trump’s campaign, recommending the hiring of both Stephen K. Bannon (from Breitbart) and Kellyanne Conway, who had been working for one of their pro-Cruz PACs.","Over the last few months of the campaign, Parscale’s team invested heavily in Facebook advertising, even hosting a Facebook employee at their Texas war room who helped guide their work. The advertising the campaign deployed was informed by Cambridge Analytica’s data.","Bloomberg reported on the data team shortly before the election and how Parscale managed the competing data from Cambridge and the Republican Party.","“Parscale was building his own list of Trump supporters, beyond the RNC’s reach,” Bloomberg’s Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg wrote. “Cambridge Analytica’s statistical models isolated likely supporters whom Parscale bombarded with ads on Facebook, while the campaign bought up email lists from the likes of Gingrich and Tea Party groups to prospect for others.”","One footnote: Campaign adviser Michael Flynn also contracted with SCL shortly before the end of the campaign, though he apparently never did any work for the company.","5. Does this mean Trump won the election unfairly?","Well, this is a broader question: Does Cambridge help win elections? Or, put another way: How much of Cambridge’s rhetoric about psychographics is just hype?","6. Fine. Where has Cambridge Analytica won elections?","In most cases, it is very hard to identify one particular factor that made the difference in a political campaign. Despite the ubiquity of politicking, campaigns do not happen that often and, when they do, there are thousands of factors that make each contest unique. So analyzing the effects of campaign tactics means perusing a small sample in which we are asked to compare apples to oranges to grapes to dogs to stars to love to six.","This is hugely advantageous for political consulting firms because it is often hard to check their claims about how effective they are. Politicians are deeply superstitious and seize on their own and others’ past successes to guide their decisions moving forward. What’s more, the field of data-driven political persuasion is fairly new, meaning a company that can claim success in a realm many career politicians do not really understand has a huge marketing advantage. Say that you have cracked the code to targeting voters with specific messages, and a lot of campaigns will write you checks.","Cambridge Analytica has not been around that long, but they have been involved in several successful campaigns. There was Sen. Thom Tillis’s (R-N.C.) Senate campaign in 2014, which he won by 1.5 points. There was the “Leave” campaign in the United Kingdom in 2016 which won by 3.8 points. And there was Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.1 points but won the electoral college.","There were also losing campaigns. Before Trump, the highest-profile effort Cambridge undertook was Cruz’s — and he lost. Sure, he ended up in second place in the delegate count despite being fairly unpopular the year before, but his strategy was like Trump’s: leverage a core base of support to ride out a crowded field of candidates.","In June 2016, Politico reported that Cruz’s team “was disappointed in Cambridge Analytica’s services and stopped using them before the Nevada GOP caucuses in late February, according to a former staffer for the Texas Republican.”","So it is hard to say in the abstract the effect Cambridge might have had in Trump’s race — and it is harder still to say what role the laundered Facebook data played.","About a year after the election, Cambridge’s Nix said in an interview that his firm wasn’t able to leverage its psychographics on Trump’s behalf.","Here is Nix, speaking to TechCrunch:","“We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. … We had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitative psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.”","7. Is special counsel Robert S. Mueller III tracking this whole thing?","Apparently.","Given that the Trump campaign and Cambridge invested so much in targeting people online, and given that we know Russian actors tried to leverage Facebook ads and social media to influence voters, there is a natural question as to whether those two efforts had any coordination.","In July, McClatchy reported Mueller’s team was looking specifically at that.","“Congressional and Justice Department investigators are focusing on whether Trump’s campaign pointed Russian cyber operatives to certain voting jurisdictions in key states,” Peter Stone and Greg Gordon wrote. They quoted a former Pentagon staffer named Mike Carpenter. “There appears to have been significant cooperation between Russia’s online propaganda machine and individuals in the United States who were knowledgeable about where to target the disinformation,” Carpenter said.","8. So are there links to Russia?","Well, it depends on what you mean by “links.” We are in this weird moment where any even tangential link to Russia or a Russian person is heralded as a sign of questionable collusion.","So here is what we know.","The Times reports that SCL Group had spoken with the Russian oil giant Lukoil in 2014 and 2015, and that the company “was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.” (In an interview with the “Today” show on Monday, Wylie reiterated this claim.)","The paper also notes that Cambridge included questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 focus groups, though we will note this was also the time period in which Russia’s seizing of Crimea became central to American foreign policy conversations.","Late last year, the Daily Beast reported that Nix had contacted WikiLeaks’s Julian Assange before the election offering to host emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman to create a searchable database. Assange declined the offer. Those emails are believed to have been stolen by Russian hackers linked to the country’s intelligence agencies.","One other link is worth mentioning. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher who developed the tool that led to the Facebook suspension, had reportedly also received a grant from the Russian government to research social media.","“Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way,” Kogan told the Guardian."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer.","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.","Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.”","“When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said.","He said “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Related Coverage","$6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.","A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica.","“Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign.","He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.”","Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement.","“We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.","In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.”","“We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said.","Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election.","Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people.

And the political consulting industry scours the victor’s tactics so they can be sold in the next election cycle, whether they worked, were happenstance, or a mix of the two.","Exhibit A for this dynamic is the 2016 Trump campaign’s use of digital media, especially Facebook. In late February, President Trump named Brad Parscale, his digital director, as his 2020 re-election campaign manager. In the meantime, Parscale has been helping the Republican Party raise millions from small donations online.","“It begs the question, why don’t more campaigns have their digital consultant serve as their campaign manager,” wrote Peter Graves[3], a media consultant and ex-RNC regional political director for the trade publication, Campaigns and Elections. \"After all, most federal campaigns are doing the majority of their voter contact now online. Moreover, digital is the only space on campaigns that collaborates with every department.”","But what did Parscale do for Trump in 2016 that is setting the standard for 2018?","“If I had to characterize what the Trump campaign did, they automated Facebook’s best [advertising] practices at a very large scale. I think that statewide campaigns will try to do the same kind of thing in 2018,” said Colin Delany, founder of Epolitics. “I’m wondering if any new technology is going to come out of the resistance. It’s possible. I think a lot of what you are seeing is training and capacity building.”","In other words, Democrats are playing catchup to Republicans, compared to 2016, when their presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic National Committee—under a series of chairwomen—were more focused on older media platforms like TV, rather than new platforms like social media.","To begin to understand how Parscale, an online advertising specialist, went from building websites for Trump products, to running Trump’s online messaging and fundraising in 2016, to assisting the RNC with small donor outreach in 2018, to being named Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, you have to examine how Parscale used Facebook.","Consultants like Delany are quick to say they can’t tell you[4] how the Trump campaign’s messaging specifically affected voters when they cast ballots. But they can say how Parscale used Facebook, which revolutionized how national campaigns targeted and messaged likely voters.","If you roll back the clock to before the internet, a baseline emerges showing how much has changed. When I was press secretary on the 1990 campaign that first elected Bernie Sanders to the House of Representatives, I remember picking up a half-dozen TV ads for the campaign’s final stretch. Bernie looked at the stack of 30-second videos and said his future rested on those tapes. That was a statewide race in a rural state with small media markets, but compare its scale to what Parscale and Facebook did for Trump.","It’s no secret. An October 2016 in-depth report by Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg for Bloomberg.com[5] laid out the basics. It started with identifying persuadable voters in swing states, and then sending messaging poking at their biases and personality types. More recent reports, such as this weekend's Guardian report[6] featuring a Trump campaign whistleblower, added more detail showing how powerful Facebook's user profiles were in 2016.","The Trump campaign took voter files from the Republican Party, which had people’s electoral histories—age, gender, address, party registration and voting histories. They took more personalized data by Cambridge Analytica, the data-mining firm run by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, which boasted it had psychological profiles[6] of every voter. (On Friday, Facebook suspended[7] Cambridge Analytica for not deleting data taken from the social network in 2016 to create its voter profiles. The Guardian reported[6] Cambridge Analytica's data was culled from 50 million to 60 million Facebook user profiles it had stolen before it joined the Trump campaign.)","The campaign put all that voter profiling data into Facebook’s advertising supercomputers, which had its own deep profiles of users based on their pages, communications and networks. Facebook provided staffers to every major campaign in 2016 to facilitate this process. From that data merging and data mining, Parscale oversaw an operation that identified 13.5 million Facebook users in 16 states that it deemed were persuadable. It targeted those individuals with the kind of personality-driven[6] content that social media emphasizes—more opinion, belief and bias than facts.","The Trump campaign didn’t just send out original content, noted Melissa Ryan, who writes the Ctrl Alt Right Delete[8] newsletter. “The Trump campaign put out relatively few ideas of their own,” she explained[9] on Medium.com. “Instead they chose to validate and amplify the conversation happening online. They didn’t need to confirm or deny anything, they simply gave Trump’s army their megaphone… [It] put their supporters one content front and center, taking a backseat in their own campaign.”","“They were banking that people are more likely to believe something from an unofficial source that seems true rather than to believe something from an official source that actually is true,” Ryan explained. “Once they realized there was no line to cross, they went all in using social media to bully and intimidate others, spread misinformation, and mainstream the language of hate. Those who spoke out were met with a flood of abuse, and that abuse was organized. Their targets had few places to turn as tech companies turned a blind eye, and law enforcement was of little help.”","By late October, days before former FBI director James Comey announced the FBI was reopening its investigation into Clinton’s handling of classified emails, the Bloomberg reporting team said Parscale’s crew of subcontractors had determined “which social media ads [messages, memes, shares, etc.] were most effective. Those companies test ad variations against one another—the campaign ultimately generated 100,000 distinct pieces of creative content—and then roll out the strongest performers to broader audiences.”","Facebook allowed Parscale to build and target what it calls “custom audiences,” as ex-Facebook executive Antonio Garcia-Martinez explained in a Wired piece[10], “How Trump Conquered Facebook—Without Russian Ads.” Its custom audience consisted of all the impressionable voters—Trump enthusiasts on one hand, Democrats dubious about Clinton on the other—who could be encouraged to vote or encouraged not to.","Then the campaign used another Facebook advertising feature built atop that preliminary customization called “Lookalike Audiences.” It targeted another wider circle of Facebook users in the swing constituencies in swing states. Some of this was to keep Trump’s base engaged. Some was to discourage three key columns of Clinton supporters from voting. As Bloomberg noted, “idealistic white liberal, young women and African Americans” were the targets of Trump’s three voter suppression campaigns.","Garcia-Martinez, the original product manager for \"Custom Audiences,” explained how the Trump campaign targeted audiences and then fed it content, often propaganda from other online sources. This explains how Breitbart.com temporarily had more traffic[11] than Fox News in the campaign’s final weeks. But Garcia-Martinez’s explanation also alludes to platform features that are designed to be psychologically engaging and provoke emotional responses. It starts with creating political echo chambers filled with like-minded associates.","“We’ve all contributed to this political balkanization by self-sorting (or being sorted by Facebook) into online tribes that get morphed into filter bubbles, which are then studiously colonized by commercial memes planted and spread there by a combination of Custom and Lookalike Audiences,” he wrote. “One of the ways the Trump campaign leveraged Lookalike Audiences was through its voter suppression campaigns among likely Clinton voters. They seeded the Audiences assembly line with content about Clinton that was engaging but dispiriting. This is one of the ways that Trump won the election, by the very tools that were originally built to help companies like Bed Bath & Beyond sell you towels.”","Colin Delany, the online media consultant and author on the topic, is quick to point out that it’s impossible to trace how all this messaging affected voters’ behavior when they cast their 2016 ballots. That’s because the thread Parscale could observe—whether messaging recipients liked, commented on or shared his handiwork—was broken as voters put down their devices and picked up ballots.","But Delany said there was another metric that confirmed how powerful and engaging Facebook was before 2016’s Election Day. It helped raise a fortune for Trump.","“Now one of the main things with Facebook is this is one of the few operations that I’ve heard of that’s been able to raise a significant amount of money by targeting people on Facebook,” he said. “Now my suspicion is that almost all the money actually got raised by email. But they would identify and recruit the people via Facebook.”","“If you can get them to respond to the first fundraising pitch and give you $5, then you are in their email program. Or you get them to sign a petition. You get them to do whatever it is that gets them the email address,” Delany said. “The small donor lists that the RNC is using to pretty good effect right now comes out of the work that Parscale did for Trump. If you want to look for results, I think you can look to social media fundraising.”","Seen from that metric, there’s no denying the political power of social media. With 10 days to go before Election Day, Bloomberg reported that Parscale’s operation raised $275 million from 2.5 million small donors. That’s more than the nearly $238 million raised by the Sanders presidential campaign from his grassroots base. Think about that: Parscale’s operation outraised Bernie’s operation—but Parscale isn’t bragging about it.","The Clinton campaign, as many political insiders and former Facebook executives have said, didn’t use Facebook as aggressively. In one intriguing series of recent tweets[12], these tech and political insiders said that Democrats in general rely more on TV ads than online messaging, partly because political consultants can earn more that way. They also said her campaign was relying on dated internal assessments by Facebook (from 2010) about its effects on voter participation, and that overall, its campaigns discounted—and didn’t sufficiently study—“observational political science,” or how voters responded to social media provocations in focus groups.","These cringe-worthy observations are part and parcel of political campaigns, which are like startups that rapidly pop up and then mostly disappear after Election Day. Political campaigns are perpetually in search of messaging and fundraising infrastructure they can use; just as institutions like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have created infrastructure seeking new users. Garcia-Martinez, reached by email, said he was stunned by how little political professionals—and academics who study politics—know about advertising.","“My recent [Wired] piece tossed me into a few threads with political/election/academic Twitter, and I found it a very strange world,” he wrote. “Very punctiliously following strict experimental protocols and the scientific method, and also not knowing the first f**king thing about how to advertise on Facebook (their studies measure what they can as outsiders, which isn't much). It is a leap of faith to just assume Facebook ads work for politics.... but without question, they work for more commercial direct-response advertisers.”","His takeaway: “Parscale is hailed as this genius, but all he did is what any reasonably savvy ecommerce operation would have done, and that set him way beyond Hillary and the supposedly ‘best and brightest.’ Which is why, as Delany and Graves, campaign media consultants and columnists, said, social media will be at the center of 2018’s elections for control of Congress and constitutional offices in swing states."],"isopubdate":""}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

This took place over several years, even before Facebook’s apps offered to track call and text history, thanks to an exploit in one of Android’s older permissions APIs.","Dylan McKay of New Zealand was one of the first to discover Facebook’s collection of call and text records. He used the social network’s option to download a copy of its archive of his data, finding that there was roughly two years of call history from his Android phone, with metadata including contact names, phone numbers, and the length of calls made and received.","Ars Technica confirmed this with its own Facebook data archive, as well as with several Facebook users who had the app installed on Android devices for several years, finding call and message data dated as far back as 2015.","While recent versions of Messenger and Facebook Lite on Android devices have made specific requests for access to call and SMS logs — part of the social network’s efforts to improve its friend recommendation algorithm — Facebook may have already been able to access the data for years. Prior to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, Facebook’s Android app asked for contacts permission, and if granted, it also allowed access to call and message data automatically. Android eventually changed the way this permission worked in version 16 of its API.","However, it appears that apps could get around this change by specifying an older version of the Android SDK. This allowed Facebook’s API to continue collecting call and SMS logs up until October 2017, when Google retired Android API version 4.","A Facebook spokesperson told Ars Technica that Facebook’s apps explicitly ask permission to access contacts and other logs, and that it’s entirely optional, with users able to delete their contact data using a tool on Facebook’s website via web browser. Unfortunately, it’s not made clear if choosing to erase this contact data also deletes the metadata from calls and texts.","UPDATE: Facebook has just released a statement to clarify and, in essence, refute the damning report. The gist of its explanation is that it has been an opt-in feature that users have to explicitly agree to and can opt out at anytime. This feature, which Facebook says it users to help users find who in their contacts are on Facebook, doesn’t crawl through the content of messages nor does the company sell the information. Whether uploading your friends’ number to Facebook’s server without their knowledge, much less their constent, is probably still legally debatable.

He said \"we would still like to hear from Mr Zuckerberg as well\" but said that the committee was \"very happy to invite Mr Cox to give evidence.\"","Collins also released a written statement about Zuckerberg's decision not to give evidence:","\"Facebook has got many questions to answer that their executives have failed to answer in previous appearances before our Committee. As Mark Zuckerberg's deputy we hope that Chris Cox has the sufficient authority and operational responsibility to concretely answer these questions.","\"Given the seriousness of these issues we still believe that Mark Zuckerberg is the right person to give evidence, and would like him to confirm if he will make himself available to the Committee.

Since then Facebook’s situation has only gotten worse.","On March 26, Tom Pahl, the Federal Trade Commission’s acting director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection released a statement confirming that the agency is investigating Facebook for violations of a 2012 consent decree that established requirements for how Facebook protects user data.","Further reading","“Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,” Pahl said in his statement. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","The penalties for violating such an agreement with the FTC include fines of up to $40,000 per violation. In addition, the FTC can make the consent decree even stronger by subjecting Facebook to greater regulation.","Facebook already faces more stringent regulation in Europe. The way it handles user data will be controlled by the General Data Protection Regulation when it goes into effect on May 25.","Furthermore Germany’s Justice Minister Katarina Barley reportedly has summoned Facebook executives into a meeting to explain the data loss. Barley told Reuters that breaches such as Facebook’s can’t happen again and that Facebook would be regulated much more strictly. Apparently she feels that the GDPR on its own isn’t strict enough, given Facebook’s practices.","Facebook may also face consequences beyond whatever action the FTC takes. According to Thomas Jackson, a partner at Phillips Nizer who chairs that firm’s technology practice group, the FTC investigation could also open the door to state attorneys general to take their own actions. “The FTC’s jurisdiction is somewhat limited,” he said.","At least 37 state attorneys general are demanding information from Facebook about when the breach occurred, when Facebook become aware of the breach and what safeguards were in place to protect users’ privacy.","Cook County, Ill. has filed suit in Circuit Court on behalf of millions of Illinois residents claiming that Facebook committed fraud for failing to protect users’ privacy.","Meanwhile, others in the tech industry are beginning to call for regulation including Apple CEO Tim Cook. “I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,” Cook reportedly told Bloomberg during a meeting in Beijing over the weekend.","Cook is well known for his strong stance on privacy, even to the extent of defying government investigators who wanted Apple to help break its iPhone encryption. Cook said that he’s been worried for years that people were giving up their personal information without realizing it was happening.","Cook’s call for services such as Facebook to be regulated are certain to resonate with many in Congress who are already studying the idea. The Commerce Committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate have indicated that they want Zuckerberg to testify. Members of those committees are already discussing what social media data protection regulations should look like.","The Senate Commerce Committee have already sent Zuckerberg a series of questions about the Cambridge Analytica breach and Facebook’s subsequent handling of user notifications and data handling.","At this point there’s no agreement about what regulation might look like, or even whether it should take the form of legislation or FTC regulation. The FTC has the framework in place to protect consumer privacy, but it’s not clear that it has the statutory authority to handle situations such as Facebook’s widespread data sharing with advertisers or market researchers.","“There needs to be some balance struck so that social media companies have the ability to monetize what they’re offering,” Jackson said, but he added that social media companies to take responsible positions on how that information is used.","The regulatory picture may change following the FTC investigation if the agency finds that Facebook violated its consent decree, but that doesn’t necessarily bind other social media networks.","What Congress needs to do is find a way through legislation to create a framework for consumer data protection as it applies to all cloud-based services, not just social media. Consumers need to know how their data is being protected, who’s keeping it and in some cases where it’s stored. Companies that use and store consumer data should be prepared to explain what they do to it, and they should be accountable for what happens to it.","At a minimum, that protection must include data security protections meeting a set of defined standards, it must include encryption, and it must include strict limits on data sharing.","Note that this suggestion goes beyond just social media, and while it applies to those companies, it must also apply to other collectors of personal data, including services such as Equifax, not to mention everything from cable television providers to insurance companies.","As it is now, when consumer data gets breached and exposed or stolen, the only consequence seems to be a sort of corporate “Oops, my bad.”","One of the significant parts of the EU’s GDPR is that there are real consequences for bad corporate behavior. While the GDPR may be too strict in the eyes of U.S. lawmakers, the idea that people’s data has value and must be protected is one that needs to be codified.","As it is right now, market forces aren’t doing anything to correct the kind of loose behavior that we’ve seen with Facebook and in previous data breaches involving Equifax, Uber and a number of other companies that failed to protect their customers’ data.","Like the GDPR, the financial penalties should be significant, but there should also be criminal penalties when the behavior is particularly egregious. Ultimately, nothing gets a board’s attention like seeing their CEO in an orange jumpsuit.","By submitting your information, you agree that eweek.com may send you eWEEK offers via email, phone and text message, as well as email offers about other products and services that eWEEK believes may be of interest to you. eWEEK will process your information in accordance with the Quinstreet Privacy Policy.","We ran into a problem","We already have your email address on file.

Settings, which had previously been separated by asking questions like “How do I stop someone from bothering me?,” are now divided into security, personal information, ads you see and management of who sees your posts and profile information.","In its blog post, Facebook claims many of these changes have been in the works for a while and that regulators, legislators and privacy experts were consulted during the process. The company also says it will be proposing updates to its terms of service in the coming months.","The fallout from reports in several publications that Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed the Facebook data of 50 million users has continued. The data mining firm, which has ties to the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, has denied any wrongdoing.","“These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” Erin Egan, VP and Chief Privacy Officer for Policy, and Ashlie Beringer, VP and Deputy General Counsel, said.","Whether these changes will be enough to mollify the concerns of privacy experts, lawmakers and the FTC, is anyone’s guess. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly going to testify before U.S. lawmakers, although he has so far declined to do the same their British counterparts.","Christopher Carbone is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

That European law could put a significant burden on digital platforms and advertisers to obtain clear consent from consumers when using their digital data.","Specifically, the tech giant is shuttering its five-year-old Partner Categories program, which lets advertisers use data from third parties to deliver ads to specific consumers. From Facebook's description of the program:","With Partner Categories you can target people based on offline behaviors people take outside of Facebook, such as owning a home, being in the market for a new truck or being a loyal purchaser of a specific brand or product.","Facebook's Partner Categories offering was the result of a slew of data partnerships with companies such as Axiom and Oracle. These companies pull data from surveys, public records, and store-loyalty cards, among others.","This kind of ad targeting was useful, but doesn't make up the bulk of Facebook's ad business","While Partner Categories was useful to some brands, the majority of Facebook's advertisers' either employ Facebook's rich set of data on its users or their own data for ad targeting, according to ad buyers. Both of those targeting options are still available.","Generally speaking, Partner Categories appealed to big advertisers that don't have their own consumer data — like, say, packaged-goods advertisers that primarily sell their products in stores or car brands that sell through dealers.","Conversely, brands that sell directly to consumers - companies along the lines of Dollar Shave Club, Casper and Warby Parker — are less likely to need third-party data to run ad campaigns, since they collect their own data from their customers.","Also, it's important to note that while Facebook is taking away the option of using third-party data to target people with ads, marketers will still be able to use data from the Oracles of the world to measure the effects of campaigns.","In other words, a toothpaste brand will no longer be able to use third-party data to send ads to people who are frequent supermarket shoppers. But they will still be able to use data from these third parties to track whether ads on Facebook resulted in people buying their products in stores.","So this move is unlikely to cause Facebook's revenue to plunge overnight. But it could frustrate many big advertisers, many of which are wrestling with how effective Facebook advertising is in the first place.","Facebook is embracing data populism","But Facebook clearly wants to be more conservative with its data. Or at least it wants to look like it is, as pressure mounts on the company to disclose what happened with Cambridge Analytica and the 2016 election.","\"We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories,\" Facebook product marketing director Graham Mudd said in a statement. \"This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people's privacy on Facebook.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

A spokeswoman for Twitter declined comment. Spokespeople for Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The Senate’s upcoming hearing is hardly the only major political and legal challenge facing Facebook.

The news initially sent Facebook’s stock price tumbling, though it reversed those losses by the end of the day as the market surged.","For the U.S. government, a key question is whether Facebook's business practices violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over another privacy mishap.

Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), are regular critics of the tech industry’s privacy practices.","On Monday, Blumenthal said that federal officials investigating Facebook should be “penetrating and prompt in holding [it] accountable for apparent illegal action.” He even suggested in a statement that “possible remedies should include damage payments to users, and other court-ordered action.”","For now, the Senate Judiciary Committee session is set to “broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” the committee announced Monday. “It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Tony RommTony Romm is a technology policy reporter at The Washington Post.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

It also said it plans to implement a basic ad filter in Firefox later this year.","Mozilla began developing Containers for Firefox in 2016 and started deploying them last year. The technology provides a way to create contexts (tabs) in which browser-based data – cookies, indexedDB, localStorage, and cache – can be sandboxed.","Containers extend the browser's same-origin security model by adding an OriginAttribute called userContextId. So when browsing example.com in a Container named Work, for instance, any resulting cookies would be limited to that container. They would not be accessible if browsing in a different Container.","Facebook Container implements a Container specifically for Facebook, to restrain its informational reach – Facebook tries to track interactions on third-party websites that have implemented Facebook technology such as the Like button or Facebook Login.","\"The Add-on keeps Facebook in a separate Container to prevent it from following your activity on other websites,\" the Facebook Container code repository explains. \"When you first install the add-on, it signs you out of Facebook and deletes the cookies that Facebook uses to track you on other websites.\"","In a blog post, Nick Nguyen, Mozilla's VP of Firefox Product, says, \"As a user of the internet, you deserve a voice and should be able to use the internet on your own terms.\"","It's an ironic choice of words since it's common to browse the internet under someone else's terms – the terms of service asserted by internet sites that disavow user privacy. (Veteran observers of this space may recall Facebook openly abandoned any pretense of privacy in 2011 when it replaced its Privacy Policy with a Data Use Policy.)","Nguyen describes Facebook Container as a tool to protect against the unanticipated consequences of internet usage, albeit a limited one.","\"But troves of data are being collected on your behavior on the internet, and so giving users a choice to limit what they share in a way that is under their control is important.\"","Facebook Container is far from a complete privacy system.

But the system remained a disaster, with fewer than 40 percent of third- through eighth-graders reading or doing math at grade level.","Russakoff, a former Post reporter, devoted the next several years to real-time reporting about what happened to Zuckerberg’s $100 million and another $100 million in matching funds. The effort she relates in her resulting book, “The Prize ,” is a far more complex and humbling endeavor than anticipated, a case study in the difficulty of translating good intentions into concrete results.","As told by Russakoff, it is a story of well-meaning reformers so convinced of the correctness of their approach, and the urgency of their task, that they failed to do the hard work of winning the support of a wary community, while spending millions on $1,000-a-day consultants.","It is a story of politicians, especially then-Mayor Booker, with more ambition than attention span, leaving behind unfinished business — and students lagging years below grade level — as they climb the political ladder.","It is a story of the earnest young billionaire whose conviction that the key to fixing schools is paying the best teachers well collided with the reality of seniority protections not only written into teacher contracts but also embedded in state law.","It is a story of dedicated teachers like Princess Williams, whose kindergartners began the school year not knowing the difference between the front and back covers of a book, and the difficulty of solving educational problems in the context of such pervasive poverty and neglect.","It is, above all, a heart-breaking story of students like Alif Beyah, a seventh-grader reading at a second-grade level, stumbling over simple words yet “promoted year after year despite failing basic subjects.”","As they envisioned the enterprise before its launch, Russakoff writes of Booker and Zuckerberg, “their stated goal was not to repair education in Newark but to develop a model for saving it in all of urban America.” Yet “two hundred million dollars and five years later, there was at least as much rancor as reform.”","That glum assessment notwithstanding, there is a more optimistic way to interpret the Newark experience, much of which has to do with the success of the city’s fast-growing charter schools. Charters, which received about $60 million of the philanthropy, now serve 30 percent of the district’s students, and families are clamoring to enroll their children.","The reasons are obvious. Unencumbered by bureaucracy and legacy labor costs, charters can devote far more resources to students, providing the kind of wraparound services that students like Beyah need.","An analysis by Advocates for Children of New Jersey noted “a substantial and persistent achievement gap” between students at charter and traditional public schools: “For example, while 71 percent of charter school students in Newark passed third-grade language arts tests in 2013-14 — higher than the state average of 66 percent — only 41 percent of students in Newark traditional public schools passed those tests.”","As for the district schools forced — or incentivized — to compete with charters, those involved with the Newark effort point to green shoots of change. Graduation rates are up. More higher- rated teachers are staying than lower- performing ones. Still, on state tests of third- to eighth-graders, math and reading proficiency went down in all six grades between 2011 and 2014.","Russakoff offers instruction in the daunting complexity of education reform — but also insight into the at least partial promise of charters. Because five years, it turns out, is not a long time in the quest to fix a failing system. It is a long time in the life of a child who is being failed."],"isopubdate":"2018-09-18"}

Kogan maintains that he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","Facebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor – Kogan’s business partner at the time their company acquired the data, using an app called thisisyourdigitallife.","Cambridge Analytica – a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon – used the data to build sophisticated psychological profiles of US voters.","Facebook’s public statements have omitted any reference to GSR, the company Kogan incorporated in May 2014 with Chancellor, who at the time was a postdoctoral research assistant.","The Guardian asked Facebook several questions about its recruitment of Chancellor and any action it had taken in light of the data harvesting scam conducted by GSR. Facebook initially promised to respond to a set of questions by Sunday, but then said it had nothing to say on the matter. Chancellor did not respond to repeated requests for comment.","The psychologist, who is 38, is understood to have been a junior partner to Kogan, who oversaw GSR’s business dealings and then elicited the help of several of his students. One source with some knowledge of Chancellor’s role at the company described him as “just the data guy”.","However, both Kogan and Chancellor were listed as directors of GSR when it was founded and provided a “service address” in Harley Street, London.","In the months that followed the creation of GSR, the company worked in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica to pay hundreds of thousands ofusers to take the test as part of an agreement in which they agreed for their data to be collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions strong. That data sold to Cambridge Analytica as part of a commercial agreement. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising.","Chancellor resigned his directorship of GSR in September 2015, according to company records. He joined Facebook around November 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile.","The following month, the Guardian published the first story detailing how Kogan and Chancellor’s company had unethically sourced data that was then passed to Cambridge Analytica, which at the time was working for the presidential campaign of Ted Cruz.","Facebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor at that stage. His role at Facebook was mentioned in a story by the Intercept 12 months ago. At that time, Facebook said in a statement: “The work that he did previously has no bearing on the work that he does at Facebook.”","Chancellor, who was conducting postdoctoral research at Cambridge University when GSR was set up, is understood to have been one of several students who Kogan involved in his project.","Data scandal is huge blow for Facebook – and efforts to study its impact on society","Read more","Since joining Facebook, some of Chancellor’s academic research has been published in peer-reviewed journals. However, the precise nature of his work for Facebook is unclear. The company employs many in-house social scientists to conduct research on the psychology of its users.","In 2014, Facebook was revealed to have conducted a vast experiment on users, without their consent, which entailed tweaking the amount of positive and negative content appearing on their feeds to see if the tech giant could manipulate some kind of “emotional contagion”.","Last year, leaked documents revealed how Facebook had told advertisers they had the capacity to monitor posts in real time and identify when teenage users were feeling “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”.","That kind of finite information is invaluable to advertisers – whether selling products or political candidates – as it helps them more effectively tailor and target their message to individual users on the platform.","Facebook’s ability to create granular profiles of its users has been at the very core of its business model, transforming the social media platform into one of the most profitable companies on the planet."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

The GSMA also announced at Mobile World Congress today that six operators – KDDI, MegaFon, NTT DOCOMO, SoftBank, Telefónica and Turkcell – will work on a new phase of the initiative focused on disaster preparedness that builds on the foundation established over the past year.","The GSMA’s Big Data for Social Good initiative was launched in February 2017 and is today backed by 20 mobile operators1 with a presence in 124 markets around the world. The initiative has enabled mobile operators to jointly establish a holistic framework and approach to analysing the data captured on operators’ networks to help public agencies and NGOs tackle epidemics, natural disasters and environmental crises.","“Over the last 12 months, the Big Data for Social Good initiative has generated significant momentum among operators and UN agency partners,” commented Mats Granryd, Director General of the GSMA. “We have equipped operators with a comprehensive blueprint of best practice guidelines for big data deployments. This approach has been tested and validated via several real-world trials around the world and supported by an advisory panel that has provided input from across the ecosystem.","“We are now expanding the initiative into the area of disaster preparedness, where we can harness the power of big data to understand, prepare for and reduce the effects of disasters on vulnerable populations.”","The Big Data for Social Good initiative is supported by an advisory panel consisting of global agencies and partners, including Data 2X, DIAL, GPSDD, Be He@lthy Be Mobile, OCHA, UN Global Pulse, UNDP, UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP and, most recently, the World Bank.","First Wave of Trials Showcasing Big Data Capabilities Big Data for Social Good is currently being trialled by Bharti Airtel in India; by Telefónica in Brazil; and by Telenor Group in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand. In these trials, operators are capturing anonymised, aggregated mobile indicators in a consistent output format, whilst respecting and protecting the privacy of individuals via an agreed Code of Conduct. The data is then combined with a wide variety of other data types to provide vital insights for public officials and NGOs.","In India, Bharti Airtel and the GSMA are working with Be He@lthy, Be Mobile (a joint initiative of the WHO and the ITU) to identify whether insights from mobile data can support national health systems. The trial is looking at how population volume and movement patterns can improve planning to control tuberculosis (TB), one of the biggest killers in India. In the trial, mobile data is providing detailed, up-to-date behavioural insights across a population of 280 million people, delivering a combination of scale and granularity that is unattainable from any other data source. The trial is identifying potential hotspots at higher risk of TB, which could help target interventions such as vaccination programmes, tobacco cessation initiatives, awareness campaigns or the deployment of mobile clinics.","Telefónica Brazil is using mobile network big data to monitor air pollution in São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, and help improve the city’s traffic management and environmental planning. Using mobility data, it has been possible to predict pollution problems up to two days before they occur, allowing the city to take precautions to protect public health, such as guiding traffic via alternative routes and advising vulnerable populations, such as those with respiratory conditions, on areas of high pollution. The mobility data used in the trial also delivered greater granularity and wider reach than traditional fixed air quality and traffic sensors, which are expensive to deploy.","Following Telenor’s successful collaboration with Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health that addressed the spreading of dengue fever in Pakistan, Telenor, Harvard, and MORU (the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Bangkok) are now addressing the critical issue of Multi-Drug-Resistant (MDR) Malaria, which is spreading in Asia. In 2017, preparatory work for studies on the spreading of MDR Malaria in a contiguous, three-nation area (Thailand, Bangladesh and Myanmar), was conducted.","Expanding the Initiative to Focus on Disaster Preparedness The results of the trials to date, combined with mobile operators’ own initiatives, are providing the basis for the next wave of Big Data for Social Good deployments in 2018, which will focus on disaster preparedness in key countries including Chile, Colombia, Japan, Russia and Turkey.","In disaster-prone zones, mobile operators can access location and usage information in near real time, enabling relief agencies to identify zones at risk and direct resources efficiently. In Japan, for example, mobile operators are working with the Disaster Management Bureau Cabinet Office at the Government of Japan to allow rescue teams to act quickly and prioritise the deployment of resources in the event of a large-scale disaster. In Latin America, Telefónica has an alliance with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to develop a better assessment of which regions and populations are most vulnerable to natural disasters linked to the effects of climate change to help authorities design prevention plans accordingly.","“The use of mobile big data capabilities for disaster preparedness situations is a key example of how the mobile industry is contributing to the SDGs,” added Granryd. “The work to date demonstrates that by combining mobility data with other data sources, operators can build a business case to support decision-making and planning by governments and NGOs across a wide variety of use cases.”","Demonstrations of the operator Big Data for Social Good trials can be seen during Mobile World Congress at the GSMA Innovation City, located in Hall 4, Stands 4A30, 4A5 and 4A15 in Fira Gran Via.","-ENDS-","About the GSMA\nThe GSMA represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, uniting nearly 800 operators with more than 300 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem, including handset and device makers, software companies, equipment providers and internet companies, as well as organisations in adjacent industry sectors.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

And the political consulting industry scours the victor’s tactics so they can be sold in the next election cycle, whether they worked, were happenstance, or a mix of the two.","Exhibit A for this dynamic is the 2016 Trump campaign’s use of digital media, especially Facebook. In late February, President Trump named Brad Parscale, his digital director, as his 2020 re-election campaign manager. In the meantime, Parscale has been helping the Republican Party raise millions from small donations online.","“It begs the question, why don’t more campaigns have their digital consultant serve as their campaign manager,” wrote Peter Graves, a media consultant and ex-RNC regional political director for the trade publication, Campaigns and Elections. \"After all, most federal campaigns are doing the majority of their voter contact now online. Moreover, digital is the only space on campaigns that collaborates with every department.”","SPONSORED","But what did Parscale do for Trump in 2016 that is setting the standard for 2018?","“If I had to characterize what the Trump campaign did, they automated Facebook’s best [advertising] practices at a very large scale. I think that statewide campaigns will try to do the same kind of thing in 2018,” said Colin Delany, founder of Epolitics. “I’m wondering if any new technology is going to come out of the resistance. It’s possible. I think a lot of what you are seeing is training and capacity building.”","In other words, Democrats are playing catchup to Republicans, compared to 2016, when their presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic National Committee—under a series of chairwomen—were more focused on older media platforms like TV, rather than new platforms like social media.","To begin to understand how Parscale, an online advertising specialist, went from building websites for Trump products, to running Trump’s online messaging and fundraising in 2016, to assisting the RNC with small donor outreach in 2018, to being named Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, you have to examine how Parscale used Facebook.","Consultants like Delany are quick to say they can’t tell you how the Trump campaign’s messaging specifically affected voters when they cast ballots. But they can say how Parscale used Facebook, which revolutionized how national campaigns targeted and messaged likely voters.","If you roll back the clock to before the internet, a baseline emerges showing how much has changed. When I was press secretary on the 1990 campaign that first elected Bernie Sanders to the House of Representatives, I remember picking up a half-dozen TV ads for the campaign’s final stretch. Bernie looked at the stack of 30-second videos and said his future rested on those tapes. That was a statewide race in a rural state with small media markets, but compare its scale to what Parscale and Facebook did for Trump.","It’s no secret. An October 2016 in-depth report by Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg for Bloomberg.com laid out the basics. It started with identifying persuadable voters in swing states, and then sending messaging poking at their biases and personality types. More recent reports, such as this weekend's Guardian report featuring a Trump campaign whistleblower, added more detail showing how powerful Facebook's user profiles were in 2016.","The Trump campaign took voter files from the Republican Party, which had people’s electoral histories—age, gender, address, party registration and voting histories. They took more personalized data by Cambridge Analytica, the data-mining firm run by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, which boasted it had psychological profiles of every voter. (On Friday, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica for not deleting data taken from the social network in 2016 to create its voter profiles. The Guardian reported Cambridge Analytica's data was culled from 50 million to 60 million Facebook user profiles it had stolen before it joined the Trump campaign.)","The campaign put all that voter profiling data into Facebook’s advertising supercomputers, which had its own deep profiles of users based on their pages, communications and networks. Facebook provided staffers to every major campaign in 2016 to facilitate this process. From that data merging and data mining, Parscale oversaw an operation that identified 13.5 million Facebook users in 16 states that it deemed were persuadable. It targeted those individuals with the kind of personality-driven content that social media emphasizes—more opinion, belief and bias than facts.","The Trump campaign didn’t just send out original content, noted Melissa Ryan, who writes the Ctrl Alt Right Delete newsletter. “The Trump campaign put out relatively few ideas of their own,” she explained on Medium.com. “Instead they chose to validate and amplify the conversation happening online. They didn’t need to confirm or deny anything, they simply gave Trump’s army their megaphone… [It] put their supporters one content front and center, taking a backseat in their own campaign.”","“They were banking that people are more likely to believe something from an unofficial source that seems true rather than to believe something from an official source that actually is true,” Ryan explained. “Once they realized there was no line to cross, they went all in using social media to bully and intimidate others, spread misinformation, and mainstream the language of hate. Those who spoke out were met with a flood of abuse, and that abuse was organized. Their targets had few places to turn as tech companies turned a blind eye, and law enforcement was of little help.”","By late October, days before former FBI director James Comey announced the FBI was reopening its investigation into Clinton’s handling of classified emails, the Bloomberg reporting team said Parscale’s crew of subcontractors had determined “which social media ads [messages, memes, shares, etc.] were most effective. Those companies test ad variations against one another—the campaign ultimately generated 100,000 distinct pieces of creative content—and then roll out the strongest performers to broader audiences.”","Facebook allowed Parscale to build and target what it calls “custom audiences,” as ex-Facebook executive Antonio Garcia-Martinez explained in a Wired piece, “How Trump Conquered Facebook—Without Russian Ads.” Its custom audience consisted of all the impressionable voters—Trump enthusiasts on one hand, Democrats dubious about Clinton on the other—who could be encouraged to vote or encouraged not to.","Then the campaign used another Facebook advertising feature built atop that preliminary customization called “Lookalike Audiences.” It targeted another wider circle of Facebook users in the swing constituencies in swing states. Some of this was to keep Trump’s base engaged. Some was to discourage three key columns of Clinton supporters from voting. As Bloomberg noted, “idealistic white liberal, young women and African Americans” were the targets of Trump’s three voter suppression campaigns.","Garcia-Martinez, the original product manager for \"Custom Audiences,” explained how the Trump campaign targeted audiences and then fed it content, often propaganda from other online sources. This explains how Breitbart.com temporarily had more traffic than Fox News in the campaign’s final weeks. But Garcia-Martinez’s explanation also alludes to platform features that are designed to be psychologically engaging and provoke emotional responses. It starts with creating political echo chambers filled with like-minded associates.","“We’ve all contributed to this political balkanization by self-sorting (or being sorted by Facebook) into online tribes that get morphed into filter bubbles, which are then studiously colonized by commercial memes planted and spread there by a combination of Custom and Lookalike Audiences,” he wrote. “One of the ways the Trump campaign leveraged Lookalike Audiences was through its voter suppression campaigns among likely Clinton voters. They seeded the Audiences assembly line with content about Clinton that was engaging but dispiriting. This is one of the ways that Trump won the election, by the very tools that were originally built to help companies like Bed Bath & Beyond sell you towels.”","Colin Delany, the online media consultant and author on the topic, is quick to point out that it’s impossible to trace how all this messaging affected voters’ behavior when they cast their 2016 ballots. That’s because the thread Parscale could observe—whether messaging recipients liked, commented on or shared his handiwork—was broken as voters put down their devices and picked up ballots.","But Delany said there was another metric that confirmed how powerful and engaging Facebook was before 2016’s Election Day. It helped raise a fortune for Trump.","“Now one of the main things with Facebook is this is one of the few operations that I’ve heard of that’s been able to raise a significant amount of money by targeting people on Facebook,” he said. “Now my suspicion is that almost all the money actually got raised by email. But they would identify and recruit the people via Facebook.”","“If you can get them to respond to the first fundraising pitch and give you $5, then you are in their email program. Or you get them to sign a petition. You get them to do whatever it is that gets them the email address,” Delany said. “The small donor lists that the RNC is using to pretty good effect right now comes out of the work that Parscale did for Trump. If you want to look for results, I think you can look to social media fundraising.”","Seen from that metric, there’s no denying the political power of social media. With 10 days to go before Election Day, Bloomberg reported that Parscale’s operation raised $275 million from 2.5 million small donors. That’s more than the nearly $238 million raised by the Sanders presidential campaign from his grassroots base. Think about that: Parscale’s operation outraised Bernie’s operation—but Parscale isn’t bragging about it.","The Clinton campaign, as many political insiders and former Facebook executives have said, didn’t use Facebook as aggressively. In one intriguing series of recent tweets, these tech and political insiders said that Democrats in general rely more on TV ads than online messaging, partly because political consultants can earn more that way. They also said her campaign was relying on dated internal assessments by Facebook (from 2010) about its effects on voter participation, and that overall, its campaigns discounted—and didn’t sufficiently study—“observational political science,” or how voters responded to social media provocations in focus groups.","These cringe-worthy observations are part and parcel of political campaigns, which are like startups that rapidly pop up and then mostly disappear after Election Day. Political campaigns are perpetually in search of messaging and fundraising infrastructure they can use; just as institutions like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have created infrastructure seeking new users. Garcia-Martinez, reached by email, said he was stunned by how little political professionals—and academics who study politics—know about advertising.","“My recent [Wired] piece tossed me into a few threads with political/election/academic Twitter, and I found it a very strange world,” he wrote. “Very punctiliously following strict experimental protocols and the scientific method, and also not knowing the first f**king thing about how to advertise on Facebook (their studies measure what they can as outsiders, which isn't much). It is a leap of faith to just assume Facebook ads work for politics.... but without question, they work for more commercial direct-response advertisers.”","His takeaway: “Parscale is hailed as this genius, but all he did is what any reasonably savvy ecommerce operation would have done, and that set him way beyond Hillary and the supposedly ‘best and brightest.’ Which is why, as Delany and Graves, campaign media consultants and columnists, said, social media will be at the center of 2018’s elections for control of Congress and constitutional offices in swing states.","Don't let big tech control what news you see.

The stories covered a growing scandal involving a lecturer at the University of Cambridge, an analytics firm called Cambridge Analytica and data on more than 50 million Facebook accounts that was reportedly accessed without the users' consent.","\"He lied to those users and he lied to Facebook about what he was using the data for,\" Stamos wrote.","The tweets were a full-throated defense of the world's largest social network and the harshest language the company had used against Kogan since revealing Friday that it had suspended Kogan, along with Cambridge Analytica, from its service.","So why didn't I link to the tweets? Because Stamos deleted them, in what looks like an attempt to remove them from the public record.","Of course, nothing truly disappears from the internet, and within minutes, other Twitter users postedscreenshots of his now-disappeared tweets.","Facebook didn't respond to a request for comment about its social media policy for executives and whether it allows them to delete posts made in their official capacity. Stamos didn't respond to a direct message on Twitter. And on Monday, Stamos reportedly had decided to leave the social network, though he subsequently tweeted that he had changed roles and remained \"fully engaged with my work at Facebook.\"","Now playing:Watch this:\nDid Facebook lose control of your information?","3:28","Public square, public record","About 330 million people use Twitter each month to post 280-character musings about what's on their mind. The service attracts some of the most high-profile people in the world, from titans of industry such as Apple CEO Tim Cook to celebrities including Kim Kardashian West. President Donald Trump's Twitter feed regularly sets the political world on its ear, easily changing the conversation and focus in Washington.","Not all of those tweets, however, stay in place. Factbase, a service that tracks politicians' tweets, counted more than 300 tweets that have been posted and then deleted from Trump's feed alone since 2011. In Trump's case, recent removals were ostensibly for misspellings or incorrect word use (last week, the president wrote about the \"Marine Core.\") But that hasn't stopped a group of people from regularly collecting and cataloging his tweets to ensure that a fuller public record exists, blemishes and all.","More on the Cambridge Analytica saga","\"While there are many gray areas that exist across personal life, private devices and messaging for transparency and record keeping, updates to public timelines on social media platforms by politicians acting in their official capacity should be preserved for posterity and public good,\" said Alex Howard, deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation, an open-government advocacy group that until 2016 ran Politwoops, a website tracking deleted tweets from politicians. (It's now run by ProPublica.)","Everyone else isn't held to such a high standard, though. Tech billionaires and their employees, like Facebook's Stamos, don't have a legal responsibility to collect records of their social media posts.","Still, the episode raises questions about Twitter's role in public discourse and as a trustworthy source of information. Twitter makes it remarkably easy for anyone to join a public conversation from anywhere in the world. But when people say something they later regret or even want to hide, should they be allowed to rewrite history by merely pushing a delete button?"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Some are at risk of losing it all to war and violence, others by more subtle forces of aggression like debt collectors, job and food insecurity or gentrification. Typically, there is never only one thing at stake either: losing a mode of transportation means missing out on food or a job, then possibly a home, medical care and the lives of loved ones. A study in 2012 found that poverty is likely a main cause of generalized anxiety, especially for women and mothers; women make up 70 percent of the 1.3 billion people in poverty.","Paranoid Personality Disorder","The consistent and very real looming threat that poor people in developing countries face daily can leave a lasting impression on their psyche, resulting in distrust and suspicion of everything. Typically, negative early developmental experiences and a hostile home life are known to be the conventional causes, and symptoms do not become problematic or clear until early adulthood.","Children in developing countries and poor areas are at risk for the personality disorder due to extreme domestic situations, lack of education and the prevalence of violence or deception from adults. In September, UNICEF published this finding: children make up the vast majority of the poor population, around 47 percent to adults’ 27 percent. With 19.5 percent of the global child population being poor, that means there are over 380 million children living in dire circumstances that could alter their mental health forever.","Major Depressive Disorder","Depression is a dangerously elusive way that poverty hurts mental health in the developing world. Finding sufferers is hard because it is mostly felt rather than communicated. The ambiguous somatic aspects and the dependence on language make understanding the severity of each case difficult. For example, a study conducted in Zimbabwe noted that it is “vital to understand the culture-specific terminology.”","Every culture has a word or phrase that explains depression-like symptoms, but most of these countries have few, if any, mental health clinics or psychiatrists available to help. This is severely debilitating, especially for those whose livelihoods depend on physically strenuous work. Among 36 nations, an estimated $1 trillion is lost every year due to an absence of investment in mental health provisions for depression. In 2014, a study in Pakistan found that half of women were depressed due to oppressive cultural standards. In Uganda, some areas hit hardest by the HIV/AIDS epidemic saw a spike in depression by 21 percent.","Bipolar Disorder","Like depression, bipolar disorder can sometimes be hard to detect and treat. Some areas in developing countries often stigmatize sufferers. From traditional or ritualistic care to outright imprisonment, many developing countries do not have the resources required to aid them. Around 25 to 50 percent of people in developing countries with the disorder are estimated to attempt suicide, and 15 percent succeed, a rate that is 30 times higher than the general population. The most common contributing factors besides genetic predisposition are substance abuse and trauma, both of which are associated with living in impoverished areas. Onset is estimated to occur between ages 18 and 24, with instances of the disorder being three times more common in urban areas than rural farmlands.","Unfortunately, psychological treatment is uncommon throughout the world; in countries like the U.S., only 44 to 70 percent of patients get help. But in developing countries, it is even less: around 90 percent go unnoticed. Access to mental health-related services like psychiatric clinics help limit the impact but often do little on the side of rehabilitation and treatment due to fewer intensive resources. Hygienic facilities, proper sewage, shelter, violence-reducing efforts and various human resources help minimize the prevalence of mental illness societally, while talk therapy, motivational counseling, sensitivity training and education helps individuals personally.","The relationship between poverty and mental illness is complex, but understanding and stopping it is not."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games like FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences, says The Washington Post.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by getting the data under the pretense of academic use, the Post says. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” says Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas and a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016 say Facebook didn't conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","“As with Google, Facebook’s business has been built on data and the ‘contract’ they’ve struck with their users for access to all of their data in exchange for offering free services,” says Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, a media trade association focusing in part on improving online ads. “This model has clearly eroded consumer and publisher trust as both have become more wise to the dangers of leaving it to Facebook to use the data how they see fit.”","Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer, is leaving amid internal disagreement over how much Facebook should publicly share about the way nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, The New York Times reports.","Meanwhile, a broadcast Monday by Britain’s Channel 4 News shows executives from Cambridge Analytica speaking to undercover reporters about company services such as entrapping rival candidates in fake bribery stings and hiring prostitutes to seduce them.","Wired says if you haven’t updated your Facebook privacy and security settings lately, do it now.

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

You’ll see us test this in the coming weeks.","— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) September 17, 2018","The next step is to replace the setting with a new \"easier-to-access\" switch allowing users to choose to see tweets listed in chronological order, rather than by the algorithms Twitter thinks will help you find the content you're most interested in.","\"Our plan is to eventually replace this setting when the easier-to-access switch described above is available,\" the company said.","More from Twitter","Facebook and Twitter bosses unscathed after feeble senate committee fails to land a punch","Facebook and Twitter ban over 900 accounts in bid to tackle fake news","Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones still on Twitter despite bans from other tech companies","Twitter turns to Oxford experimental psychologists over hate speech","Who were the biggest losers in the Twitter 'locked' account purge?","Twitter continued: \"We'll keep you updated and are listening to your feedback – let us know what you think!\"","Users were quick to do just that. @Popyfm said: \"If you're working on new ways to give me more control over my timeline, where do i disable likes so they don't show up on the timeline? This isn't Facebook.\"","Twitter will let you see your feed in chronological order again—here’s how and why","Since 2016, following someone on Twitter has been an unexpectedly complicated affair. What was previously a reverse-chronological feed of every tweet, picture, gif, threat, misguided political opinion, or dad joke became algorithm-driven chaos designed to steer you toward tweets that would maximize engagement. Features like “Tweets you may have missed” and random tweets liked by another account you follow would show up in the stream.","It wasn’t an uncommon move at the time—Facebook and even Instagram shifted from their once-orderly ways. The algorithms had taken over social media, Skynet style.","Now, in 2018, Twitter is letting users get back to a purely chronological timeline without all of the extra stuff and reorganization injected into it.","To go back to the pre-2016 era, open up your Twitter app or go to twitter.com, then go to Settings and Privacy > Content Preferences > and turn off the toggle switch at the top.","Twitter’s official statement on the matter (delivered via blog post) says making this change will be simpler and more obvious in the coming weeks. It will likely use language like \"best\" tweets to try and rope you into sticking with the algorithm, but the option will be more visible without digging into the menus.","Why now?","Twitter’s official reason for making the change is user demand, which makes sense since it’s likely one of the most requested features after the ability to edit tweets. However, the timing also comes just a few weeks after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey appeared in front of two Congressional committees to talk about the company’s policies on corporate transparency","During those hearings, we found out that Twitter had “shadow-banned” roughly 600,000 people (the official term is “downranked).” AI determined those accounts may be harmful based on the actions of their followers and not necessarily the content they posted. You can read a full recap of the hearings here in case you didn’t spend that day glued to C-Span.","Dorsey said several times during the hearings that he intended to increase transparency across the company, even considering releasing transparency reports when the company did internal investigations about content removed from the service. Switching back to a purely chronological feed shifts the responsibility back to the user to curate what they see.","Leaving this switch on will let the algorithm push up tweets that it thinks you will interact with to the top of your stream.","Twitter","Will this make my twitter feed less toxic?","Back in 2015, Facebook released its own study on “Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook,” It was an attempt to find out if the newsfeed algorithms were creating “echo chambers” regarding political ideas. The results were, as you might expect, mixed, but there is evidence out there to demonstrate how simple it is to fall into a homogenous social media cocoon, especially when it comes to politics.","The Wall Street Journal created an interesting interactive tool that lets you see the difference between “liberal” and “conservative” feeds.","A study from Aalto University also found politically moderate posts received less overall attention than obviously skewed to one side or the other. Obviously, Twitter users can create this kind of bubble for themselves by curating their user list, but that doesn’t mean Twitter needs to take an active role in serving it up the second you open the app.","Should you definitely make the switch?","Not everyone is totally sold on the idea that the algorithm is bad. If you follow thousands of accounts, letting the machine pull out some you’re most likely to interact with may actually make sense. But, that may also indicate that your Twitter practices overall could use a revamp and using things like lists to organize your feed could make your experience better.","Selfishly, however, I hope this move works out well for Twitter because my one true social media wish is that Facebook would put Instagram back on the chronological feed plan. Seeing Sunday beach pictures here on Tuesday morning is really bumming me out."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post.

About 270,000 people downloaded the app and gave Kogan access to their data, like city and content they had liked. That information should have remained with Kogan, but he instead gave it SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie. They used it to build profiles on potential voters for use in political campaigns.","The operation was not limited to 270,000 people, though. Kogan's app also provided access to \"more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it,\" Grewal wrote— aka friends of friends—which allowed Cambridge to build profiles for millions of potential voters.","Ultimately, the New York Times reports, Kogan provided Cambridge with \"50 million raw profiles,\" of which \"roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records\" and build what Cambridge called \"psychographic profiles.\"","This data collection started in 2014 and Facebook was made aware of it in 2015. At that point, \"we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed,\" Grewal wrote. \"Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.\"","They had not. According to the Times, \"a former [Cambridge] employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.\"","Grewal said Facebook was told the data had not been deleted \"several days ago, [and] we are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.\" The Times said it sent questions to Facebook about the data for a week, but \"Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control.\"","In a Saturday statement, Cambridge Analytica said it \"deleted all data\" received from Kogan when it \"became clear that the data had not been obtained...in line with Facebook's terms of service.\"","Wylie left Cambridge in late 2014 and has since become a rather outspoken critic of the firm's tactics.","How did the Trump campaign come into play? As the Times reports, billionaire Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, starting with $1.5 million for the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial race. That didn't pan out; Democrat Terry McAuliffe won. But Mercer and other high-profile GOP donors had their eyes on a bigger prize—Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential bid.","But creating voter profiles is expensive, so Cambridge turned to Kogan and his Facebook app for data collection. Their efforts on the Cruz campaign were reported by The Guardian in late 2015, which is when Facebook found out and demanded that the data be destroyed. It was not, and when Cruz failed to secure the GOP presidential nomination, Cambridge turned its attention to the Trump campaign.","As Jared Kushner told Forbes in late 2016, \"We found that Facebook and digital targeting were the most effective ways to reach the audiences. The campaign \"brought in Cambridge Analytica,\" Kushner said, which worked with Brad Parscale, the campaign's digital lead. Parscale was recently selected to lead President's Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.","Cambridge Analytica denies using any of the offending Facebook material for Trump's campaign. \"No data from [Kogan] was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" it said Saturday. \"Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations.\"","UPDATE 3/19: Facebook said Monday it hired Stroz Friedberg to audit the Cambridge servers and systems to see if its data was actually deleted. Kogan also agreed to an an audit, according to Facebook, but Wylie has not.","\"We also want to be clear that today when developers create apps that ask for certain information from people, we conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data, Facebook said. \"We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process. Kogan's app would not be permitted access to detailed friends' data today.\"","Related","However, the audit was abruptly put on hold so that the UK's Information Commissioner's Office could get to the site first to conduct their own investigation, Facebook said in an updated post.","The Cambridge controversy has caught the attention of Capitol Hill. Sen. Ron Wyden has asked Mark Zuckerberg for detailed information on what happened in this case, while Sens. Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar said the incident is a clear example of why their proposed Honest Ads Act, introduced with Republican John McCain, is necessary.","About the Author","Before joining PCMag.com, Chloe covered financial IT for Incisive Media in NYC and technology policy for The National Journal's Technology Daily in Washington, DC.

Then they used this data to help the Trump and Brexit campaigns psychologically manipulate voters through targeted ads. The result was Vote Leave ‘won’ the UK’s Brexit referendum and Trump was elected president in the US.","Unfortunately, almost everything in the above summary is false or misleading.","First, There was no hack.","The data collected was scraped from Facebook user profiles, after users granted permission for a third party app to access their data. You know those little confirmation windows that pop up when someone wants to play Candy Crush or use Facebook to log in, rather than make a new password, for a random site? Yeah those.","A Cambridge academic called Aleksandr Kogan — NOT Cambridge Analytica and NOT the whistleblower Christopher Wylie — made a ‘Test Your Personality’ app, helped to promote it by paying people $2–4 to install it on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site, and used the permissions granted to harvest profile data. 270,000 users installed the app, so you might expect that 270,000 profiles were collected but the app actually collected data from 50 million profiles.","50 million?!?","Yes. You see back in the heady days of 2014, Facebook had a feature called ‘friends permission’ that allowed developers to access the profiles of not only the person who installed their app but all their friends too. The only way to prevent this from happening was to have toggled a privacy setting, which few Facebook users even knew existed (here is a blog from 2012 explaining how to do so). The friends permission feature is how Kogan multiplied 270,000 permissions into 50 million profiles worth of data.","That Facebook users were having their data shared by their friends without their knowledge or permission was a serious concern that many privacy advocates noted at the time. So in 2015, facing growing criticism and pressure, Facebook removed the feature citing a desire to give their users “more control”. This decision caused consternation amongst developers as the ability to access friends profiles was extremely popular (see the comments under this 2014 post from Facebook announcing the changes). Sandy Parakilas, an ex-Facebook manager, reported to Bloomberg that “tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers” were making use of the feature before it was discontinued.","To review, there are two key points to remember at this point:","None of what I just described involves ‘hacking’ Facebook or exploiting a bug. Instead, it all revolves around the use of a feature that Facebook provided to all developers and (at least) tens of thousands took advantage of.","The data collected was not internal Facebook data. It was data that developers (s̵c̵r̵a̵p̵e̵d̵ ) accessed* from the profiles of people who downloaded their apps (and their friends). Facebook has a lot more data on users than is publically available and it has it for everyone who uses their platform. No one but Facebook has access to that data. This is a point that almost all the journalists involved seem unable to grasp, instead they repeatedly equate ‘Facebook’s internal data’ to ‘data (s̵c̵r̵a̵p̵e̵d̵ )accessed from Facebook profiles using a third party app’. But these are VERY different things.(*changed term as per convincing suggestion provided in the responses.)","The importance of this second point becomes apparent when you read exchanges like this one:","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.","This exchange is being reported as evidence that Facebook lied to politicians about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. But when you understand the difference between Facebook’s internal data and data collected on Facebook by outside developers it is clear that what Facebook’s policy director is saying is very likely true.","So where does Cambridge Analytica come in to the story?","Well, they paid Kogan to collect those 50 million profiles. Whose idea that was originally is currently a matter of ‘he said, she said’. Kogan says Cambridge Analytica approached him and Cambridge Analytica says Kogan came to them. Whatever the case may be, this is the part of the story where there was an actual breach; not of Facebook’s internal data but of Facebook’s data sharing policies. Developers were permitted to collect all the user data they wanted from their apps, but what they were not allowed to do — even back in 2014 — was take that data and sell it to a third party.","The fact that there were (at minimum) tens of thousands of developers with access to such information meant that it was inevitable that data harvested on Facebook was being sold, or otherwise provided, to a wide array of third parties. Again, the disgruntled ex Facebook manager confirmed as much:","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on. Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers.","So given how prevalent Facebook data harvesting was and that there are many developers with more than 270,000 users to harvest from, why is Cambridge Analytica receiving so much media attention?","The answer to this seems to primarily be how journalists, particularly Carole Cadwalladr at the Observer, have framed the story. The majority of coverage has pushed two angles. First, that a whistleblower from Cambridge Analytica revealed ‘a major breach’ of Facebook’s data, an issue covered above, and second, that this ‘breach’ was linked to the success of Trump’s presidential campaign.","Chris Wylie the mastermind who ‘hacked’ Facebook…","This second angle is as dubious as the first and relies heavily on bombastic claims made by Chris Wylie—the pink haired ex-Cambridge Analytica employee pictured above. Carole Cadwalladr, who spent years on the story, has explained in various interviews that she approached the story not as an investigative journalist but as a features writer. This meant that she focused on delving into ‘the human side of the story’, or put another way- Chris Wylie. There are pros and cons to such an approach but the biggest drawback is how invested and reliant it made her and subsequent coverage in accepting Wylie’s narrative, which just so happens to paint him as a young mastermind at the center of global political conspiracies.","Cadwalladr fully endorses Wylie’s presentation and fawningly describes him as: “clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling” … “impossibly young” … “His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible” … “Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time” … “when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something — his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead — it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold” … “his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great BritishBake Off.”","Wow… what a guy.","Cadwalladr’s person-focused approach might make for more accessible articles but it also helps to obscure the relevant technical details in favour of providing sensationalist quotes and personal anecdotes from Wylie and his friends and coworkers. Presenting these kinds of details could be insightful, if they were subjected to sufficient critical examination but this rarely occurs. Cadwalladr, instead, seems to have entirely bought into Wylie’s narrative: “by the time I met him in person, I’d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time.”","So let’s address the oversight and take a bit more of a critical look at what Wylie’s narrative claims:","That Cambridge Analytica claims to be able to provide effective tools for psychological targeting and manipulation… Certainly true.","That Chris Wylie, himself, was involved with some shady business and views himself as partly responsible… Sure.","That the self-promotional claims of Cambridge Analytica actually equate to how effective the services they provide are… Hmmmm.","This last point is the most important and yet it is also the one lacking almost any supporting evidence.","The temptation might be to point to Trump’s surprising victory but there are a lot of confounding factors there. Trump won, yes. But he won against the most unpopular Democratic candidate in modern history, who was vying for a third Democratic term (something which had not been achieved since the 1940s). Furthermore, he won by a very slim margin and actually lost the popular vote.","Could all that just be evidence of how precise Cambridge Analytica’s psychological targeting was? Maybe, but we start to run into the perils of dealing with an unfalsifiable hypothesis. A better approach would be to look at Cambridge Analytica’s relative record of success and failure. Unfortunately, we do not have access to their full client list but we do know that when they first rose to prominence they were working for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. That’s right, Ted Cruz — the Republican senator who was crushed by Trump in the Republican primaries, despite having the power of Cambridge Analytica at his command. I am not the first to notice this apparent contradiction, Martin Robbins made the same point on Little Atoms last year:","So the story of the Republican primaries is actually that Cambridge Analytica’s flashy data science team got beaten by a dude with a thousand-dollar website. To turn that into this breathtaking story of an unbeatable voodoo-science outfit, powering Trump inexorably to victory, is quite a stretch. Who else have they even worked for? Without a list of clients it’s very easy to cherry-pick the winners.","The techniques that Cambridge Analytica purport to use involve using social network data to build algorithms that can accurately predict what kind of messages will be effective given an individual’s personality and psychology. This is what the stories mean when they talk about using psychographics to micro-target voters. But a lot of the claims being made about the effectiveness of such techniques is widely exaggerated. Kogan — the Cambridge academic at the heart of the controversy — has made similar arguments. He claims that he is being scapegoated and argues that the personality profiles he gathered turned out to not be particularly useful for making the predictions needed for micro-targeting:","In fact, from our subsequent research on the topic,” he wrote, “we found out that the predictions we gave SCL were 6 times more likely to get all 5 of a person’s personality traits wrong as it was to get them all correct. In short, even if the data was used by a campaign for micro-targeting, it could realistically only hurt their efforts.","Kogan is hardly an impartial source but his claim accords with various studies that have shown less than stellar results for nefarious social media manipulation. Take, for instance, the controversial Facebook ‘mind control’ study, which I’ve heard several journalists reference in recent days. What always seems to be missing from reporting on this study is just how underwhelming it was.","Facebook ran an experiment on almost 689,000 users in which it tweaked the algorithm running their news feed to display slightly more or slightly less status updates from friends that contained positive or negative words. As any researcher knows, with such a large sample you are guaranteed to find statistically significant differences between groups. A more important criteria with such massive groups is how large the effect observed was. In the Facebook study this equated to a truly terrifying difference: those who saw less negative updates used around 0.05 more positive words out of every 100 words in their status updates, whereas those who saw less positive updates used around 1 less positive word per 100 in their status updates. That’s right Facebook might have been able to manipulate people to use around 1 less positive word for every 100 words in their updates. It would be wrong to paint this as Facebook being powerless, bigger interventions would have bigger effects, but it is important to keep things in perspective.","Note the starting point of the y-axis. There is a reason it isn’t 0.","The real story then is not that Kogan, Wylie, and Cambridge Analytica developed some incredibly high tech ‘hack’ of Facebook. It is that, aside from Kogan’s data selling, they used methods that were common place and permitted by Facebook prior to 2015. Cambridge Analytica has since the story broke been outed as a rather obnoxious, unethical company- at least in how it promotes itself to potential clients. But the majority of what is being reported in the media about its manipulative power is just an uncritical regurgitation of Cambridge Analytica (and Chris Wylie’s) self-promotional claims. The problem is that there is little evidence that the company can do what it claims and plenty of evidence that it is not as effective as it likes to pretend; see the fact that Ted Cruz is not currently president.","No one is totally immune to marketing or political messaging but there is little evidence that Cambridge Analytica is better than other similar PR or political canvassing companies at targeting voters. Political targeting and disinformation campaigns, including those promoted by Russia, certainly had an impact on recent elections but were they the critical factor? Did they have a bigger impact than Comey announcing he was ‘reopening’ the Hillary email investigation the week before the US election? Or Brexiteers claiming that £250 million was being stolen from the NHS by the EU every week? Colour me skeptical.","To be crystal clear, I’m not arguing that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan were innocent. At the very least, it is clear they were doing things that were contrary to Facebook’s data sharing policies. And similarly Facebook seems to have been altogether too cavalier with permitting developers to access its users’ private data.","What I am arguing is that Cambridge Analytica are not the puppet masters they are being widely portrayed as. If anything they are much more akin to Donald Trump; making widely exaggerated claims about their abilities and getting lots of attention as a result.","***I added a follow up piece to clarify some of my positions and address some of the common criticisms I saw, you can find it here.","*****************************************************************You can find me talking about similar stuff on twitter: @C_Kavanagh"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016.

The boards were frequented by remote freelance workers who bid on “human intelligence tasks” in an online marketplace, called Mechanical Turk, controlled by Amazon. The “turkers,” as they’re known, tend to perform work that is rote and repetitive, like flagging pornographic images or digging through search engine results for email addresses. Most jobs pay between 1 and 15 cents. “Turking makes us our rent money and helps pay off debt,” one turker told The Intercept. Another turker has called the work “voluntary slave labor.”","The task posted by “Global Science Research” appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would “download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.”","“Our terms of service clearly prohibit misuse,” said a spokesperson for Amazon Web Services, by email. “When we learned of this activity back in 2015, we suspended the requester for violating our terms of service.”","Although Facebook’s early growth was driven by closed, exclusive networks at college and universities, it has gradually herded users to agree to increasingly permissive terms of service. By 2014, anything a user’s friends could see was also potentially visible to the developers of any app that they chose to download. Some of the turkers noticed that the Global Science Research app appeared to be taking advantage of Facebook’s porousness. “Someone can learn everything about you by looking at hundreds of pics, messages, friends, and likes,” warned one, writing on a message board. “More than you realize.” Others were more blasé. “I don’t put any info on FB,” one wrote. “Not even my real name … it’s backwards that people put sooo much info on Facebook, and then complain when their privacy is violated.”","In late 2015, the turkers began reporting that the Global Science Research survey had abruptly shut down. The Guardian had published a report that exposed exactly who the turkers were working for. Their data was being collected by Aleksandr Kogan, a young lecturer at Cambridge University. Kogan founded Global Science Research in 2014, after the university’s psychology department refused to allow him to use its own pool of data for commercial purposes. The data collection that Kogan undertook independent of the university was done on behalf of a military contractor called Strategic Communication Laboratories, or SCL. The company’s election division claims to use “data-driven messaging” as part of “delivering electoral success.”","SCL has a growing U.S. spin-off, called Cambridge Analytica, which was paid millions of dollars by Donald Trump’s campaign. Much of the money came from committees funded by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who reportedly has a large stake in Cambridge Analytica. For a time, one of Cambridge Analytica’s officers was Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s senior adviser. Months after Bannon claimed to have severed ties with the company, checks from the Trump campaign for Cambridge Analytica’s services continued to show up at one of Bannon’s addresses in Los Angeles.","“You can say Mr. Mercer declined to comment,” said Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesperson for Robert Mercer, by email.","Facebook Elections signs in the media area at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Aug. 6, 2015, before the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election.","Photo: John Minchillo/AP","The Intercept interviewed five individuals familiar with Kogan’s work for SCL. All declined to be identified, citing concerns about an ongoing inquiry at Cambridge and fears of possible litigation. Two sources familiar with the SCL project told The Intercept that Kogan had arranged for more than 100,000 people to complete the Facebook survey and download an app. A third source with direct knowledge of the project said that Global Science Research obtained data from 185,000 survey participants as well as their Facebook friends. The source said that this group of 185,000 was recruited through a data company, not Mechanical Turk, and that it yielded 30 million usable profiles. No one in this larger group of 30 million knew that “likes” and demographic data from their Facebook profiles were being harvested by political operatives hired to influence American voters.","Kogan declined to comment. In late 2014, he gave a talk in Singapore in which he claimed to have “a sample of 50+ million individuals about whom we have the capacity to predict virtually any trait.” Global Science Research’s public filings for 2015 show the company holding 145,111 British pounds in its bank account. Kogan has since changed his name to Spectre. Writing online, he has said that he changed his name to Spectre after getting married. “My wife and I are both scientists and quite religious, and light is a strong symbol of both,” he explained.","The purpose of Kogan’s work was to develop an algorithm for the “national profiling capacity of American citizens” as part of SCL’s work on U.S. elections, according to an internal document signed by an SCL employee describing the research.","“We do not do any work with Facebook likes,” wrote Lindsey Platts, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica, in an email. The company currently “has no relationship with GSR,” Platts said.","“Cambridge Analytica does not comment on specific clients or projects,” she added when asked whether the company was involved with Global Science Research’s work in 2014 and 2015.","The Guardian, which was was the first to report on Cambridge Analytica’s work on U.S. elections, in late 2015, noted that the company drew on research “spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission.” Kogan disputed this at the time, telling The Guardian that his turker surveys had collected no more than “a couple of thousand responses” for any one client. While it is unclear how many responses Global Science Research obtained through Mechanical Turk and how many it recruited through a data company, all five of the sources interviewed by The Intercept confirmed that Kogan’s work on behalf of SCL involved collecting data from survey participants’ networks of Facebook friends, individuals who had not themselves consented to give their data to Global Science Research and were not aware that they were the objects of Kogan’s study. In September 2016, Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, said that the company built a model based on “hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans” filling out personality surveys, generating a “model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.”","Shortly after The Guardian published its 2015 article, Facebook contacted Global Science Research and requested that it delete the data it had taken from Facebook users. Facebook’s policies give Facebook the right to delete data gathered by any app deemed to be “negatively impacting the Platform.” The company believes that Kogan and SCL complied with the request, which was made during the Republican primary, before Cambridge Analytica switched over from Ted Cruz’s campaign to Donald Trump’s. It remains unclear what was ultimately done with the Facebook data, or whether any models or algorithms derived from it wound up being used by the Trump campaign.","In public, Facebook continues to maintain that whatever happened during the run-up to the election was business as usual. “Our investigation to date has not uncovered anything that suggests wrongdoing,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Intercept.","Facebook appears not to have considered Global Science Research’s data collection to have been a serious ethical lapse. Joseph Chancellor, Kogan’s main collaborator on the SCL project and a former co-owner of Global Science Research, is now employed by Facebook Research. “The work that he did previously has no bearing on the work that he does at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Intercept.","Chancellor declined to comment.","Cambridge Analytica has marketed itself as classifying voters using five personality traits known as OCEAN — Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism — the same model used by University of Cambridge researchers for in-house, non-commercial research. The question of whether OCEAN made a difference in the presidential election remains unanswered. Some have argued that big data analytics is a magic bullet for drilling into the psychology of individual voters; others are more skeptical. The predictive power of Facebook likes is not in dispute. A 2013 study by three of Kogan’s former colleagues at the University of Cambridge showed that likes alone could predict race with 95 percent accuracy and political party with 85 percent accuracy. Less clear is their power as a tool for targeted persuasion; Cambridge Analytica has claimed that OCEAN scores can be used to drive voter and consumer behavior through “microtargeting,” meaning narrowly tailored messages. Nix has said that neurotic voters tend to be moved by “rational and fear-based” arguments, while introverted, agreeable voters are more susceptible to “tradition and habits and family and community.”","Dan Gillmor, director of the Knight Center at Arizona State University, said he was skeptical of the idea that the Trump campaign got a decisive edge from data analytics. But, he added, such techniques will likely become more effective in the future. “It’s reasonable to believe that sooner or later, we’re going to see widespread manipulation of people’s decision-making, including in elections, in ways that are more widespread and granular, but even less detectable than today,” he wrote in an email.","Donald Trump throws a hat to supporters during a campaign rally on Sept. 15, 2015, in Los Angeles.","Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images","Trump’s circle has been open about its use of Facebook to influence the vote. Joel Pollak, an editor at Breitbart, writes in his campaign memoir about Trump’s “armies of Facebook ‘friends,’ … bypassing the gatekeepers in the traditional media.” Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, has written in his own campaign memoir about “geo-targeting” cities to deliver a debunked claim that Bill Clinton had fathered a child out of wedlock, and narrowing down the audience “based on preferences in music, age range, black culture, and other urban interests.”","Clinton, of course, had her own analytics effort, and digital market research is a normal part of any political campaign. But the quantity of data compiled on individuals during the run-up to the election is striking. Alexander Nix, head of Cambridge Analytica, has claimed to “have a massive database of 4-5,000 data points on every adult in America.” Immediately after the election, the company tried to take credit for the win, claiming that its data helped the Trump campaign set the candidate’s travel schedule and place online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times. Since then, the company has been de-emphasizing its reliance on psychological profiling.","The Information Commissioner’s Office, an official privacy watchdog within the British government, is now looking into whether Cambridge Analytica and similar companies might pose a risk to voters’ rights. The British inquiry was triggered by reports in The Observer of ties between Robert Mercer, Cambridge Analytica, and the Leave.EU campaign, which worked to persuade British voters to leave the European Union. While Nix has previously talked about the firm’s work for Leave.EU, Cambridge Analytica now denies that it had any paid role in the campaign.","Leave.EU signage is displayed in London on March 5, 2016.","Photo: Rex Features/AP Images","In the U.S., where privacy laws are looser, there is no investigation. Cambridge Analytica is said to be pitching its products to several federal agencies, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff. SCL, its parent company, has new offices near the White House and has reportedly been advised by Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, on how to increase its federal business. (A spokesperson for Flynn denied that he had done any work for SCL.)","Years before the arrival of Kogan’s turkers, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg tried to address privacy concerns around the company’s controversial Beacon program, which quietly funneled data from outside websites into Facebook, often without Facebook users being aware of the process. Reflecting on Beacon, Zuckerberg attributed part of Facebook’s success to giving “people control over what and how they share information.” He said that he regretted making Beacon an “opt-out system instead of opt-in … if someone forgot to decline to share something, Beacon went ahead and still shared it with their friends.”","Seven years later, Facebook appears to have made the same mistake, but with far greater consequences. In mid-2014, however, Facebook announced a new review process, where the company would make sure that new apps asked only for data they would actually use. “People want more control,” the company said at that time. “It’s going to make a huge difference with building trust with your app’s audience.” Existing apps were given a full year to switch over to have Facebook review how they handled user data. By that time, Global Science Research already had what it needed."],"isopubdate":""}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

The “behavioural microtargeting” company has also received around $2.5m over the past two years from conservative Super Pacs to which Mercer or members of his family have donated.","In an interview with the Guardian last month, Cruz said his funding and outreach apparatus “is very much the Obama model – a data-driven, grassroots-driven campaign – and it is a reason why our campaign is steadily gathering strength”.","Cruz is increasingly seen as a leading Republican contender, uniting factions within the party beyond his evangelical and Tea Party base. In Iowa – the first state to vote in the presidential primary, in less than two months – the outspoken Texas senator dethroned Trump in a poll for the first time this week as the mogul became ensnared in yet more controversy.","Cambridge Analytica has also worked with the Republican candidate Ben Carson, receiving $220,000 from his campaign earlier this year. But the company is more closely involved in Cruz’s presidential bid, with a team of its data scientists currently working at Cruz campaign headquarters in Houston.","Having donated $11m to the main pro-Cruz Super Pac, Keep the Promise I, Mercer is Cruz’s top financier – and the largest individual donor to Super Pacs or outside groups during the presidential election cycle thus far, according to data compiled by the political transparency website Open Secrets.","Mercer’s connections to both the Cruz campaign and the data firm that is apparently helping to power the senator’s advantages were previously reported by Politico and Bloomberg. But political strategists and privacy advocates agreed that Mercer’s parallel funding channels, combined with concerns over the surreptitious, commodified Facebook data – reported here for the first time – represented an intensified collision of billionaire financing and digital targeting on the campaign trail.","“If people begin to be turned off by Trump, the Cruz campaign will probably have a better strategic understanding of the implications and how to capitalize upon them,” said Bud Jackson, a Democratic specialist in digital grassroots campaigning, when asked to review the relationships. “Where a candidate’s campaign may be afraid to go outside the boundaries of ethical behaviour because of a potential public backlash, an outside group may be less afraid.”","See the full visual","In an interview, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler said the campaign had contracted Cambridge Analytica “because they’re a market leader and best in the field” but that officials had “done our due diligence”.","“My understanding is all the information is acquired legally and ethically with the permission of the users when they sign up to Facebook,” he said, referring questions about previous research to Cambridge Analytica.","The Guardian contacted Cambridge Analytica prior to publication via email with its findings and a list of detailed questions. Repeated calls were also made to its offices in Washington and New York, as well as its parent company in London. A representative in New York refused to speak with the Guardian and hung up the phone.","After this article was published, Facebook said the company was “carefully investigating this situation” regarding the Cruz campaign.","“[M]isleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do, including banning those companies from Facebook and requiring them to destroy all improperly collected data,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement to the Guardian.","Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist and senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, described the Guardian’s findings as “troubling” and highlighted shortcomings by the FEC to adequately regulate campaigns’ use of data.","“What it essentially means is there is no one regulating campaigns’ privacy data and security practices,” he said. “So it means you have a wild west, where the campaigns can do whatever they want and get away with it.”","Research that seeded data on millions","Documents seen by the Guardian show Cambridge Analytica’s parent, a London-based company called Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL), was first introduced to the concept of using social media data to model human personality traits in early 2014 by Dr Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer at Cambridge University’s renowned psychology department.","Kogan established his own company in spring that year and began working with SCL to deliver a “large research project” in the US. His stated aim was to get as close to every US Facebook user into the dataset as possible.","The academic used Amazon’s crowdsourcing marketplace Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to access a large pool of Facebook profiles, hoovering up tens of thousands of individuals’ demographic data – names, locations, birthdays, genders – as well as their Facebook “likes”, which offer a range of personal insights.","This was achieved by recruiting MTurk users by paying them about one dollar to take a personality questionnaire that gave access to their Facebook profiles. This raised the alarm among some participants, who flagged Kogan for violating MTurk’s terms of service. “They want you to log into Facebook and then download a bunch of your information,” complained one user at the time.","Crucially, Kogan also captured the same data for each person’s unwitting friends. For every individual recruited on MTurk, he harvested information about their friends, meaning the dataset ballooned significantly in size. Research shows that in 2014, Facebook users had an average of around 340 friends.","Source: media reports and documents seen by the Guardian","See the full visual","Kogan assured the MTurk users their Facebook data would “only be used for research purposes” and remain “anonymous and safe”.","However, the Facebook data was then used to generate sophisticated models of each of their personalities using the so-called “big five” personality traits and characteristics – openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism (known as the OCEAN scale).","By summer 2014, Kogan’s company had created an expansive and powerful dataset. His business partner boasted on LinkedIn that their private outfit, Global Science Research (GSR), “owns a massive data pool of 40+ million individuals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles”.","Documents show SCL agreed to a contract with GSR, whereby it would pay its data collection costs in order to improve “match rates” against SCL’s existing datasets or to enhance GSR’s algorithm’s “national capacity to profile capacity of American citizens”.","In an email, Kogan said he was unable to explain in detail where all the data came from, as he was restricted by various confidentiality agreements. He said SCL is no longer a client.","He said that while GSR often used MTurk for data collection, it “never collected more than a couple thousand responses on MTurk for any one project, or even across all projects for a single client – the vast majority of our MTurk data collection as a company is in the form of surveys only”. He said GSR stores Facebook data anonymously.","Kogan explained that separate from his university role, his private company undertook various commercial ventures relating to data analysis. He said that when GSR collect Facebook data, the terms detail the use that information collected will be put to and make clear to participants that they are giving GSR full permission to use the data and user contribution for any purpose.","He said Cambridge University had “no knowledge of the clients or projects GSR had worked on” and that GSR has never used any data collected as part of his university activities.","‘Packaging voters like they’re consumers’","Today, Cambridge Analytica’s central offering to US politicians is to enable them to use the OCEAN scale in shaping highly targeted campaign messages. This allows candidates like Cruz to campaign on specific issues, but communicate them in multiple ways to different audiences depending on the personal information the company holds about them.","As the company’s CEO, Alexander Nix, explains in a promotional video: “The more you know about someone, the more you can align a campaign with their requirements or their wants and needs.” He did not respond to a request for comment.","Michael Zimmer, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where he specialises in privacy and internet ethics, described this as a “particularly problematic” kind of voter targeting that raised broader concerns in the US about “packaging voters like they’re consumers”.","“It’s one thing for a marketer to try to predict if people like Coke or Pepsi,” he said, “but it’s another thing for them to predict things that are much more central to our identity and what’s more personal in how I interact with the world in terms of social and cultural issues.”","Prior to its relationship with Cruz, Cambridge Analytica worked with a handful of 2014 midterm candidates, according to FEC filings. The firm also secured hundreds of thousands of dollars of business with John Bolton’s Super Pac, formed by the hawkish former UN ambassador to support conservative candidates campaigning on national security issues.","Last week, the Cruz campaign launched a combative TV ad timed to air during a major college football game in Iowa. In the 30-second ad, Cruz vows: “We’ll rebuild our military, we’ll kill the terrorists and every Islamic militant will know – if you wage jihad against us, you’re signing your death warrant.”","Tyler, the Cruz spokesman, said Cambridge Analytica did not work on television advertising for the campaign. “They’re helping with online targeting and messaging, and that’s how we find people online,” he said.","It remains unclear when Mercer’s involvement with Cambridge Analytica began, but FEC filings show the company started working with Super Pacs that the secretive conservative donor has backed during the second half of 2014.","On Wednesday in Washington, Cruz was the only member of the Senate armed services committee to skip a hearing on US strategy to combat the Islamic State. Instead, he travelled to attend a fundraising luncheon in New York hosted by the president of Keep the Promise I, the Super Pac funded by Mercer that, one day earlier, had announced a $600,000 digital advertising strategy to be rolled out via social media in early voting states."],"isopubdate":"2015-12-11"}

CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP/Getty Images","Hours after the revelation of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal, the hashtag #DeleteFacebook began trending on Twitter. As Facebook faced investigation by lawmakers, as well as glaring scrutiny from the general public, the #DeleteFacebook campaign peaked last week when Brian Acton, a co-founder of WhatsApp, joined the movement.","Acton made a fortune from the $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition by Facebook in 2014, but he isn’t the first former Facebook beneficiary to turn against the company. Chamath Palihapitiya, Facebook’s former user growth chief and an early employee, had openly expressed regret for helping create the social media behemoth.","Both Acton and Palihapitiya have their own ventures today, but how do tech workers in general, including those working at Facebook, feel about the anti-Facebook movement?","To find the answer to this question, Blind, an online forum for tech workers, asked its users (mostly employees of tech companies, including Facebook) a simple question: Will Facebook’s data breach lead you to delete your Facebook account?","The poll, conducted from last Tuesday to Saturday, when internet search for #DeleteFacebook peaked, found that 31 percent of the 2,600 respondents said they will delete Facebook, while the remaining 69 percent said no.","At first glance, the denial rate for Facebook among tech workers is much lower than that of the general public.","A similar poll by Reuters and marketing firm Ipsos over roughly the same time period (last Wednesday through Friday) found that half of Americans don’t trust Facebook to “obey laws that protect your personal information.” The distrust rate for Facebook was significantly higher than its rival platforms, including Amazon (24 percent), Google (29 percent), Microsoft (28 percent), Apple (31 percent) and even Yahoo! (37 percent).","However, it’s worth noting that the distribution of Blind’s poll results are dramatically uneven across companies.","At Facebook, for example, only two percent of employees said they will delete Facebook. Indeed, it’s perfectly predictable that Facebook employees are the least likely to support #DeleteFacebook. Yet, two percent is still surprisingly low, considering that the survey was anonymous.","In fact, one Facebook employee felt so offended by the wording of the survey question that he/she posted on Blind, “I hope Blind gets sued calling this a data breach when it wasn’t one.”","When Facebook employees are excluded, the support rate for #DeleteFacebook averages higher and aligns closer to Reuter/Ipsos’ “distrust Facebook” rate.","Among tech companies where more than 50 employees responded to Blind’s questionnaire, half of Microsoft employees said they will delete Facebook; 46 percent of Snap employees, 40 percent of Uber, 38 percent of Google and 34 percent of Amazon employees said the same."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The company’s operations in helping the Trump campaign with psychological information about millions of Americans have been touched upon over the last few weeks, but Christopher Wylie’s groundbreaking admissions shed a whole new light on how the disinformation campaign was first conceived to be used on unsuspecting American voters during the 2016 presidential elections.","Who Is Christopher Wylie?","Christopher Wylie is a Canadian citizen who grew up dyslexic and with a diagnosis of ADHD. At 16, he left school without a single qualification, but by 17, he was working for the Leader of Opposition in Canada. A year later, he had his first tryst with big data through Barack Obama’s national director of targeting, which he then introduced to the Liberal Party in his home country. Having found his calling, he taught himself to code and left Canada for the United Kingdom to pursue law at the London School of Economics.","While a student there, he was approached by the Liberal Democrats to work for them on voter targeting. Having been hooked to data science and its usefulness to politics already, Wylie decided to balance between pursuing his law degree and working with the Liberal Democrats. He says he was interested in working for them because of his curiosity about why the Lib Dems, despite being a major force till the 19th century, had lately performed so atrociously in the elections. It was now that he came across a paper by two psychologists, Michal Kosinski and David Stillwell, who, for the first time in history, had found a way of measuring personality traits across the population and correlating scores against Facebook “likes” across millions of people. Kosinski and Stillwell had obtained the data of Facebook users with their consent for academic purposes, but later their mechanism was to be replicated by another psychologist in a completely unethical manner.","This research was of great importance to defense and military services, and they were ready to pay through the nose for Kosinski’s and Stillwell’s research. Boeing and the U.S. secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) were at least two potential clients cited by the psychologists in their research.","What Did Wylie Do Next?","For Wylie, the paper’s results had far-reaching consequences. He figured if accurate psychological profiles could be built through an algorithm similar to the one used by Kosinski and Stillwell, it could greatly impact a political party aiming to win any election. He reached to the Liberal Democrats with the idea about profiling, predicting that they would lose in an even worse manner in the upcoming elections. But the Lib Dems didn’t like Wylie’s pessimism and recused him. However, one Liberal Democrat introduced him to Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, and its subsidiary SCL Elections, which worked in the domain of informational warfare and had already conducted operations in more than 100 elections around the world. In 2007, they had spread the false propaganda which later became mainstream in Nigeria — namely that the election was going to be rigged.","Alexander Nix, then CEO of SCL Elections, made Wylie an offer he couldn’t refuse: he asked him to join SCL Elections, baiting him with a completely free hand to test out “all [his] crazy ideas.”","SCL has been referred to as the “MI6 for hire,” or “dirty MI6,” and is a contractor who works for the British government to conduct counter-extremism operations in the Middle East, as well as the U.S. Department of Defense which has contracted it to work in Afghanistan.","Without knowing about the consequences of his actions, this exceptional data nerd was to conceive an idea that would forever alter the way we view social media and its impact on global policy. Working here, he would design of Cambridge Analytica — the company one of his friends referred to as “Chris’s Frankenstein.”","“He created it. It’s his data Frankenmonster. And now he’s trying to put it right.”","The Creation Of “Steve Bannon’s Psychological Warfare Mindf**k Tool”","The basic idea that Christopher Wylie proposed was this: bring big data and social media to an established military methodology – “information operations” – then turn it on the U.S. electorate.","Stephen Bannon, then the head of Breitbart, immediately hit it off with Wylie. Bannon, who has made no secrets about his understanding of politics mirroring culture, was immediately hooked onto Christopher’s idea. Bannon believed that for the alt-right to succeed in the United States, the primary need was to first create an influence in the cultural sphere. Bannon then took Christopher Wylie to meet with Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah, at her Manhattan apartment. Mercer, co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, listened attentively to Wylie’s idea and promised him the funds to go ahead with the program, but only in the event of it working.","“In politics, the money man is usually the dumbest person in the room. Whereas it’s the opposite way around with Mercer. He said very little, but he really listened. He wanted to understand the science. And he wanted proof that it worked.”","So now Wylie, Bannon and Cambridge Analytica needed large data sets. Kosinski wanted $500,000 for the data set he had extracted out of Facebook for academic purposes. But they didn’t want to pay anyone so much as of yet. So Wylie and co. employed Global Science Research (GSR), owned by Cambridge-based academic Aleksandr Kogan, to replicate Kosinski’s research and harvest his own set of data.","Kogan then harvested the data of millions of Facebook users to sell it to his client, Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook Knew About It All Along But Never Did Anything About It","Cambridge Analytica, through Kogan’s company, got hold of a huge set of data through Facebook within a matter of weeks. Under British law, it is illegal to do so with the purpose of selling the data to a third-party like Cambridge Analytica, but Kogan told Facebook that he was using the data for academic purposes. Wylie said Facebook acted extremely irresponsibly in this regard.","“Facebook could see it was happening. Their security protocols were triggered because Kogan’s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use. So they were like, ‘Fine’.”","Facebook continues to plead ignorance even as security experts and data scientists hold it culpable for turning a blind eye to what was clearly a large data breach of the privacy of its users, something the company claims to protect.","Christopher Wylie Left Cambridge Analytica In 2014, But The Damage Was Done","Wylie left the company in 2014, which is when Special Counsel Robert Mueller — in his indictments of Russian agents — had referred to as being the time when Russia began to seriously invest in the idea of intervening with U.S. elections through a tacit control of its social media.","“In late summer of the same year that Cambridge Analytica presented a Russian oil company Lukoil (with direct ties to Putin) with an outline of its data sets, capabilities and methodology. The presentation had little to do with ‘consumers’. Instead, documents show it focused on election disruption techniques.","Wylie claims that he had no inkling that his idea which he helped execute while at Cambridge Analytica would be subverted to a such a preposterous degree. Now he wants to make amends and therefore has come forward with his story despite this act breaching non-disclosure agreements he signed with SCL as well as Robert Mercer. He stands to be sued now, but he claims that he wants to undo the terrible wrong he has unleashed on the American people."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

It made it clear that most senior and mid-level positions involving strategy, planning, fundraising or campaigning needed to be filled by US citizens.","“Any decision maker must be a US citizen or green card holder,” the memo, seen by the Observer, warned. It also provided a brief legal history of cases involving foreign involvement in election campaigns, drawn up by a lawyer at the firm founded by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.","“To the extent you are aware of foreign nationals providing services, including polling and marketing, it would appear that unless it is being done through US citizens, or foreign nationals with green cards, the activity would violate the law.”","It was clear that as a company largely run and staffed by Britons and Canadians, apart from Bannon and Mercer at the top, Cambridge Analytica – which was to go on to work on Donald’s Trump presidential election campaign – had a looming problem.","“The prohibition against foreign nationals managing campaigns, including making direct or indirect decisions regarding the expenditure of campaign dollars, will have a significant impact on how Cambridge hires staff and operates in the short term,” the memo stated.","It specifically called for Nix to step down from work on US elections. “In order for Cambridge to engage in such activities, Mr Nix would first have to be recused from substantive management of any such clients involved in US elections,” it said.","Employees working for Cambridge Analytica in the US at the time claimed that rather than tackling the problem, management appeared to ignore it.","“Mercer’s lawyer told a fairly stunned group meeting that it wasn’t allowed,” said one non-American employee who was based in the US at the time. “I’m not sure what, if anything, CA did to act on that knowledge.”","Two employees confirmed that they were still answering ultimately to Nix throughout the mid-term election campaigns that ended in November 2014. In total, more than a dozen foreigners, including Britons and Canadians, filled strategic roles in campaigns across the US.","“We were really speaking directly to the voters in a number of states,” said one former employee, who served on a team with several people who were not US citizens or green card holders.","It is understood that some were working on tourist visas. Another ex-employee claimed that they had been provided with letters to give to US border control officials where needed, stating that they would not be working there.","Robert Mercer, the owner of Cambridge Analytica. Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images","“One colleague kept raising these issues, so they gave us a piece of paper to give to immigration to say we weren’t actually working,” the second former employee said. They added that the company appeared to have taken advantage of its mostly young workforce. “It was getting a chance to travel, and to work on campaigns. Having a lot of autonomy, an adventure. When you are young and get that sort of opportunity, you take it rather than thinking about the details or consequences.”","There were no briefings on the kind of work that non-US citizens should avoid, or warnings about the legal risks. “CA was sloppy and didn’t care about its staff,” said the first employee.","Cambridge Analytica said that the company “adheres to FEC [Federal Election Commission] regulations” and that Nix had never been in charge of work on any US election campaigns.","“He has never had a strategic or operational role on any election campaigns undertaken in the US,” a spokesman said, adding that “all CA personnel in strategic roles were US nationals or green card holders and these strategic roles provided all direction to non-strategic personnel”.","The legal memo also warned Cambridge Analytica that it needed to carefully hide behind a firewall any work it did in a single state or election for a particular candidate and for any of the so-called super-PACs (political action committees) supporting the campaign.","These committees can spend unlimited funds but cannot coordinate with individual candidates.","Levy warned that the company would need “to separate working teams that are engaged in substantive work for two or more entities that are not permitted to coordinate their activities”.","The nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, which represents the public interest, has accused Cambridge Analytica over allegations of illegal coordination of this nature.","It has filed evidence with the FEC alleging that the super-PAC Make America Number 1 made illegal contributions to Trump’s campaign, “engaging in unlawful coordinated spending by using the common vendor Cambridge Analytica”.","Cambridge Analytica denied there had been any illegal coordination, saying it had a firewall policy in place, signed by all staff and strictly enforced.","“Where firewalls exist staff are physically separated; use separate databases and servers; and are prevented from communicating with each other,” a spokesman said.","“The accusations of the Campaign Legal Center are based on conjecture, tabloid stories, and hearsay that attempted to mischaracterise FEC filings where Cambridge Analytica publicly declared our non-coordinated work for different entities.”","Bannon, Mercer and Nix did not respond to requests for comment on the legal memo or their operating structure during the 2016 presidential election.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

Although Cambridge Analytica is backed by right-wing American billionaire Robert Mercer, it processed Americans’ data in the U.K., meaning that U.S. citizens can use British laws to find out what the company knows about them.","The case was initially described by Carroll as “experimental”, but now has the potential to open the black box of just how Cambridge Analytica used the massive trove of private information gathered from Facebook to construct their voter profiles. “Initially the claim was simply about privacy in the voting booth,” Carroll told ThinkProgress. “When we first started looking into this it was a research project but as the line continued it became much more significant.”","Carroll’s lawyers filed a claim last Friday asking Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), to hand over all the data they have on the professor, as well as how they got it. According to the claim, Cambridge Analytica and SCL “by their own description, engage in the business of ‘behavioral microtargetting’ — the collating and/or creating and then selling of data profiles which are used for…targeted advertising and political campaigning.” Cambridge Analytica is said to use up to 5,000 data points to help construct their profiles.","Advertisement","“We have theories as to their process but part of my initial effort is to get disclosure so we can confirm what people knew,” Carroll said. “If it was Facebook likes as the single truth for the [Cambridge Analytica] algorithms or if there were other data sets, we need to figure that out.”","In late 2016, the German publication Das Magazine first ran a piece documenting how data firms could reliably predict users behavior based on their Facebook likes, which allows political firms to “micro-target” ads for very particular subsections of likely voters. Cambridge Analytica has previously said that it “abides by all relevant data protection laws and, just as importantly, the company’s core values of integrity, respect and honesty.” However, the new revelations about how Cambridge Analytica exploited personal data from Facebook means that there is now undeniable proof that micro-targeting was used.","“Just the fact that they intended to do this — whether or not it worked — the impetus behind was to find people susceptible to propaganda and manipulation,” Carroll said. “It is truly disturbing.”","Carroll said that Facebook had a series of tough questions to answer about its relation with Cambridge Analytica, including why it currently employs Joseph Chancellor as a social psychologist. Chancellor previously worked with Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, and are believed to have harvested Facebook data which was ostensibly for academic research but was then shared with Cambridge Analytica.","Advertisement","“Where is the leadership?” Carroll asked. “Why is Zuckerberg not on TV this morning apologizing to 52 million people?”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it.”","I want to share an update on the Cambridge Analytica situation — including the steps we've already taken and our next…","Cambridge Analytica was officially formed by former Trump advisor Steve Bannon with a $15 million investment from Republican mega-donor Robert Mercer. The goal was to leverage tactics originating at Cambridge University that claimed to predict personality traits and behavior through a process called “psychographic mapping.” Cambridge Analytica hired Russian-American psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan to secure the underlying data necessary to conduct this kind of mapping, which helps campaigns target specific groups.","Kogan created an app called thisisyourdigitallife, which offered Facebook users small payments if they downloaded it and took a personality quiz. The app scraped private information from those 300,000 Facebook profiles, including data from 50 million of their unwitting Facebook friends. In 2014, Facebook updated its platform to limit the amount of data apps could access, which meant Kogan’s app could no longer get data about a user’s Facebook friends unless they too had the app.","Facebook says it removed Kogan’s app and demanded the data be destroyed in 2015 when the company learned that user information had been passed along to political operatives. Last week, Facebook was confronted with reports from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 saying that Cambridge Analytica may have not deleted that data. Its response was to immediately ban Cambridge Analytica from the platform.

They used data from at least 50 million Americans, data that was inappropriately obtained—stolen. Christopher Wylie, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica, the data firm owned by billionaire Robert Mercer, has stepped forward with explosive details on how the firm acquired the stolen data of a huge number of Americans. Robert Mercer also happens to a Trump mega-donor and owner of Breitbart News. Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah, have donated tens of millions of dollars to conservative organizations like the Heritage Foundation and plumping up the coffers of Republicans running for office nationwide. The Mercers essentially single-handedly kept Trump’s campaign afloat when others were running away. They also lent the Donald Trump campaign two key staff members. From USA Today:","The intensely private Mercers have emerged as big power brokers in Trump’s Washington. They financially backed Trump’s campaign when many establishment donors steered clear of the brash real estate magnate.","Rebekah Mercer helped persuade Trump to hire two key strategists on his campaign — pollster Kellyanne Conway, who served as campaign manager, and former Breitbart executive Stephen Bannon, who served as the campaign's CEO. Both sit in Trump’s inner circle at the White House. Rebekah Mercer served on the executive committee of Trump’s transition team, alongside three of his adult children, Bannon and other key advisers, including Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment fromRobert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","It is important to understand how this stolen data was used. Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, blew the lid off this story when he came forward over the weekend to expose how this data was stolen and later how it was likely weaponized by Steve Bannon, Cambridge Analytica and eventually the Trump campaign. This is really important. Please take a few minutes to watch this interview and share widely. They didn’t just use this data on Facebook, they wickedly used it across all platforms to alter perceptions, using fake news with real consequences for millions of Americans. And they shared all of the data with a Russian oil company with known Putin and Russian intelligence connections. They used psychologists to weaponize this data with pinpoint accuracy, manipulating public opinion. They corrupted our democracy with this data.","Robert Mercer, Rebekah Mercer, Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway corrupted our democracy and should be investigated with every resource available, especially if they knowingly handed over all of our private information to the Russians."],"isopubdate":""}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Both the Justice Department and state Attorney General have now declined to file criminal charges against the police officers involved in the case.","The officers’ handling of the confrontation came under intense scrutiny from the public at the time in part because of cell phone video. The debate over the officers’ conduct included discussion of Sterling’s criminal record and whether it is at all relevant when assessing the officers’ conduct. However, the legal questions in the case focused on what happened in the confrontation between Sterling and the officers right before he was shot. Sterling’s case file does provide a fuller biography of the man, however.","A review of court records by Heavy shows that Sterling was well known to Baton Rouge police, although the two officers involved in the shooting — Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II — are not mentioned in documents pertaining to Sterling. You can read all of Sterling’s Baton Rouge criminal case details here:","Records show that Sterling was a registered sex offender with a lengthy criminal record that included convictions for weapons offenses, confrontations with police officers, property crimes, and domestic violence and other batteries.","Here’s what we know about his criminal history:","Summary of Offenses","The documents in Sterling’s Baton Rouge court file show Sterling was accused of these offenses (some are convictions, some only arrests, some were dismissed and a few are traffic matters. The dates represent date of offense):","Sterling Had Previous Confrontations With the Baton Rouge Police","Alton Sterling. (Twitter)","One incident stands out in the lengthy file; it involved a wrestling match with an officer that involved a gun. In 2009, the affidavit of probable cause contends that a police officer tried to pat down Sterling when Sterling resisted arrest, and the officer ended up “wrestling with the defendant on the ground” at which time a “black semi auto gun fell from his waistband.” The officer grabbed the back of Sterling’s shirt during the incident, and he was able to arrest him without further incident.","In another probable cause affidavit, an officer named A. Miller wrote that he was patrolling when he saw a gray Chrysler carrying Sterling traveling 65 in a 45 mile per hour speeding zone. He pursued and stopped Sterling, who did not have proof of insurance.","An officer with the last name of Moses responded as backup, and the officers let Sterling retrieve his belongings in a duffel bag, the affidavit says. Sterling walked away and said he would “have the officers’ badge and jobs.” He went to a bus stop and then walked back across the street, and laid on the pavement in a prone position, before saying again that he would have the officers’ badge and jobs and telling them to “go ahead and beat him down regardless of the outcome,” said the court affidavit.","Sterling Was a Registered Sex Offender for a Crime Involving a Juvenile","Sterling is listed as 5 foot 11 inches tall, 310 pounds, with tattoos on his left arm, right arm, and left hand. His status is now listed as “inactive-deceased.”","Sterling’s offense is described as committing “carnal knowledge of a juvenile.” He was convicted on September 20, 2000 in Louisiana and released on October 3, 2004.","Court records show the victim was a 14-year-old girl at the time of the offenses. According to the charging document on file in the courthouse, the victim’s mother had discovered that she was pregnant after taking her to the doctor. The document says that Sterling, then 20, had been dating the victim for about seven months and having sexual intercourse with her in her bedroom. The charging document says he admitted to the mother having sex with her daughter and exhibited an “I don’t care” attitude. Heavy.com is withholding the name of the victim and mother and all victims in the Sterling court file.","According to the sentencing document in the court file, the judge gave Sterling 5 years of hard labor in the Louisiana prison system, but then gave him credit for time he already had served and suspended the balance of the sentence, putting him on probation. He was ordered to pursue a GED or trade and to perform community service, among other conditions of probation, the sentencing document says.","The case was then re-sentenced, and Sterling, who had pleaded guilty, was sentenced instead to 2.5 years of hard labor in the Louisiana prison system.","The court file said he was accused of not registering as a sex offender or notifying authorities of his change of address, requirements of the law.","Sterling Was Convicted Of Illegally Carrying a Gun & Other Weapons Offenses","(Facebook)","Alton Sterling was accused of intending to distribute, produce, or manufacture marijuana, court records show. In conjunction with the same charge, he was convicted of “knowingly and intentionally possessing a firearm while in possession of a controlled dangerous substance.” The drug charge was dismissed when he entered a guilty plea, the court records show.","In 2011, Sterling was sentenced to 5 years of hard labor in the Louisiana prison system concurrent with any other sentence.","In another probable cause affidavit, an officer, Corporal Paul Lockett, wrote that he was dispatched to a report of suspects trespassing at a home, where they had kicked in the front door and threatened the victim and her husband with a gun. In a probable cause affidavit accusing Sterling of burglary, the victim said that her door was kicked in and suspects presented several guns and made verbal threats.","In a sheriff’s affidavit on another date, Sterling was accused of breaking into a woman’s apartment by making a hole in the wall, and then trying to sell her goldfish for $20.","Sterling was also accused of possessing ecstasy and marijuana in different cases, the court file says.","Sterling Was Convicted of Domestic Battery in 2008","The court file says that Alton Sterling was convicted of domestic battery in 2008 against a member of his own household. Heavy.com is withholding the victim’s name. According to the court file, Sterling also pleaded guilty in this offense, which occurred on March 11, 2008. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail, with credit for time served.","A screen shot from the citizen video of Sterling’s shooting.","In a 2008 domestic violence battery case, the probable cause statement says that Sterling and her girlfriend were involved in a “heated verbal argument that turned physical” because he was on the phone with a female. The girlfriend said she told Sterling to leave the car but he wouldn’t, so he choked and struck her, the probable cause statement said. The statement said that Sterling denied physically harming the woman and told police she had grabbed his dreadlocks. The probable cause statement said red bruising was observed on the victim’s neck.","In a separate case in 2006, Sterling was charged with two other people in a case involving a battery with a dangerous weapon. According to the court file, he was charged with aggravated battery, simple criminal damage to property, and unauthorized entry to an uninhabited dwelling. Again, Sterling entered a plea deal. In it, charges were amended to disturbing the peace, simple battery, and simple criminal damage to property. He was sentenced to spend 6 months in prison for each count, served concurrently (which means at the same time).","In another case, Sterling was charged with a property crime: Simple burglary. Court records say he pleaded guilty in the May 2005 offense, which was amended to illegally possessing stolen property, a misdemeanor. He received 6 months in prison, but the sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation.","In 1996, court records show, he was charge with another simple battery case, but it was dismissed.","Mignon Chambers, Sterling’s sister, told WAFB-TV that he was a father of five who has been selling CDs outside the store for years. “I really wanna know more about what happened, about the whole situation, because my brother didn’t deserve it. He didn’t deserve it at all,” Chambers told the news station. Sharida Sterling, his cousin, told The Advocate, “He would have never fought the police, he wouldn’t have pulled a gun, he would have been too scared.” (Facebook)","In another domestic violence battery case, the charging document says that a girlfriend of Sterling’s said she was battered at a Mobil station and that “she and the defendant have been involved in several physical confrontations” and that she “had been battered during their relationship.”","In yet another case, Sterling was accused of entering a man’s house and demanding money. He then pushed and shoved the man, “tearing up furniture” and then others arrived to help destroy items, including appliances, the court affidavit says. The court record says that a police officer stopped Sterling, who said he had “tore up the apartment” because the victim had stolen his money. He gave his name as “Otis Deesnuts” and made a reference to a killing and having a barbecue, court records say.","596 Comments","I stumbled onto this story and was shocked at what a bad guy Sterling was. And this listing are just the things the police actually caught him doing. No way the police were batting .1000 on this guy.","And to think that there were black people up in arms about what happened. If this was a white guy in my community who had this record and did the same thing (and got shot), I would think “you moron… you put yourself on this bad path and it was not “if” but “when” you did something this stupid.","I must agree that had he been locked up he would be alive today. Alton, kept going to jail, he had too much hood in him. Even his girl says that he had a lot of women. I understand why they shot him.

With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.”","Facebook shares fell as much as 6.5 percent, briefly dipping below $150 for the first time since July 2017, before recovering the day’s losses to close up 0.4 percent at $160.06.","The shares are still down 13 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica. The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.","Related Coverage","The recovery in Facebook’s stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company’s relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.","The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.","If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.","ALL APOLOGIES","Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company’s privacy practices.","The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.","The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.","“Facebook’s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,” said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.","Slideshow (3 Images)","In Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is “absolutely certain” that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.","Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers’ access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.","“The was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time,” Zuckerberg said in the ads. “We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”","‘FUTURE REGULATION’","His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany’s justice minister said Facebook’s promises were not enough.","“In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,” Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.","Advertisers and users are also unhappy.","U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet’s YouTube for one week.","Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.","Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.","Reporting by David Shepardson; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Susan Thomas"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

I am not a cool person,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of the social-media giant, in 2014. That has never been more true. His company has spent the past year stumbling through controversies over the peddling of fake news and enabling Russian manipulation of American voters, with various degrees of ineptitude. Then, on March 17th, articles in the New York Times and Britain's Observer newspaper suggested that a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, had obtained detailed data about some 50m Facebook users and shared this trove of information and analysis with third parties, including Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The result is a corporate crisis--and a political reckoning.","Republicans and Democrats alike have called on Mr Zuckerberg and the heads of other tech firms to testify before the Senate. America's consumer watchdog, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), has also reportedly launched an investigation into Facebook's privacy policies and whether it violated a consent decree of 2011 requiring the social network to notify users about how their data are shared. British MPs have called for Mr Zuckerberg to come before a select committee.","Even Facebook's allies have unfriended it. On Twitter, Brian Acton, a co-founder of the popular messaging app WhatsApp (which Facebook bought for $22bn in 2014), encouraged people to \"#DeleteFacebook\". News of his post pinged around the internet, including on Facebook itself. Investors, who have forgiven months of bad headlines in light of Facebook's strong financial performance, are growing jittery. Between March 16th and March 21st the firm's share price fell by 8.5%, erasing $45bn in market value. Facebook is still the world's eighth-most-valuable publicly listed firm, but shareholders worry that politicians in Europe and America may impose onerous restrictions on data, suppressing growth.","Help yourself to our data","The Cambridge Analytica scandal reveals Facebook's morphing, porous privacy policies and the company's cavalier approach to oversight. The data on Facebook users were obtained by Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher at Cambridge University, who enticed some 270,000 people to take part in a survey in exchange for a small fee. When those users installed the survey app, they shared details about themselves and--unwittingly--their friends, around 50m Facebook users in all. Surprisingly, before 2015 Facebook's rules allowed the mining of social connections without each user's consent.","What happened next was never permitted by Facebook. Mr Kogan provided these data to Cambridge Analytica, which then allegedly shared them with customers, including Mr Trump's campaign. Cambridge Analytica is backed by Robert Mercer, a Republican donor; Steve Bannon, formerly a top adviser to Mr Trump, used to serve as an executive. (The Economist used Cambridge Analytica for a market-research project in the past.)","Although news of Cambridge Analytica's peddling of Facebook data was first reported in December 2015, the social network reportedly did not respond until eight months later, with a letter asking the firm to delete the data. It seems not to have checked that this was done. The lax response is evidence of wider \"systemic operational problems\", says Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research, who follows the firm.","If reports are to be believed, Cambridge Analytica has a habit of pushing ethical and legal boundaries to gather data. On March 20th Alexander Nix, its chief executive, was suspended after recordings were aired on British television that seem to capture him describing manipulating people for information. Britain's data-protection regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, is expected to search Cambridge Analytica's offices.","The scandal reverberates through politics as well as the internet. Facebook has built a mammoth advertising business, with sales of around $40bn in 2017, by gathering detailed information about users' identities and behaviour online and then selling access to them. Facebook tracks users not only on its services, including its eponymous social network and Instagram (which it owns), but across the web. Knowing that someone is a dog owner and interested in buying a new lead may not seem controversial. \"Microtargeting\" someone in order to influence their political views and voting behaviour appears more sinister.","Though political advertising is still a minuscule percentage of Facebook's revenues, perhaps around 3%, it is a growing and lucrative line. Politicians have found that using Facebook can pay dividends. Even without using illegitimately obtained data to boost targeting, the social-media firm offers precise tools to political campaigns, including reaching users on Facebook whose names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses they already have. Facebook also enables campaigns to target voters who show an interest in the same issues or have similar profiles, packaging them into what it calls \"lookalike audiences\". No other Western company apart from Google has such rich data.","Barack Obama's campaigns were digitally sophisticated and used Facebook to reach prospective voters. Yet Mr Obama got proper permission to obtain data about people's friends and did not microtarget users on an industrial scale, unlike Mr Trump's campaign. Targeting based on Cambridge Analytica's data may have helped Mr Trump win the presidency, although how much cannot be known.","A tepid response","Companies can overcome scandals. Rupert Murdoch, a media mogul, survived a maelstrom in 2011 when it was reported that a newspaper he owned had hacked the phone of a murdered girl, Milly Dowler. Mr Zuckerberg, like Mr Murdoch, has structured ownership of his firm so that he controls super-voting shares, and will probably maintain his power. But there is speculation that some of his lieutenants, including Sheryl Sandberg, could leave in the next year. The head of security, Alex Stamos, is expected to resign.","Mr Zuckerberg's response to the scandal has been modest. He has apologised and promised thorough audits of third-party app developers and steps to make it easier for users to control their privacy settings. Such basic assurances may not be enough to reverse flagging corporate morale and win back the enthusiasm of users. Trust in social media is already low, and Americans have been spending less time on Facebook, in part because so much of what they see online is negative and dubious. Globally, users spent around 50m hours less per day on Facebook in the fourth quarter of 2017, which translates into a 15% drop in time spent year over year, according to Mr Wieser.","As some users turn away, politicians in America and Europe are likely to give Facebook more of their attention. They are scrutinising Facebook's conduct and may propose new laws, especially in the domain of data privacy. In May regulations concerning data protection and user consent will come into effect in Europe. America has historically been weak on data protection, except for specific industries like health care. Overworked regulators have typically responded to reports of misconduct on a case-by-case basis, and the online advertising industry has been trusted to police itself.","Mr Obama was in favour of a consumer-privacy bill of rights, which would give users more control of their online data by requiring user consent. That made little headway because of opposition from the industry. Some politicians may want to revive talk of such a law, especially as Europe strengthens its safeguards. But political reformers seldom have an easy time in America. And, like many others, politicians have come to rely on Facebook.","The social-media giant faces a reputational crisis. Here is how\nit and the industry should respond","LAST year the idea took hold that Mark Zuckerberg might run for\npresident in 2020 and seek to lead the world's most powerful country.\nToday, Facebook's founder is fighting to show that he is capable of leading the\nworld's eighth-biggest listed company or that any of its 2.1bn users should\ntrust it.","News that Cambridge Analytica (CA), a firm linked to President\nDonald Trump's 2016 campaign, got data on 50m Facebook users in dubious,\npossibly illegal, ways has lit a firestorm (see United States section). Mr\nZuckerberg took five days to reply and, when he did, he conceded that Facebook had let its users\ndown in the past but seemed not to have grasped that its business faces a wider\ncrisis of confidence. After months of talk about propaganda and fake news,\npoliticians in Europe and, increasingly, America see Facebook as out of control and in\ndenial. Congress wants him to testify. Expect a roasting.","Since the news, spooked investors have wiped 9% off Facebook's shares. Consumers are\nbelatedly waking up to the dangers of handing over data to tech giants that are\nrun like black boxes. Already, according to the Pew Research Centre, a\nthink-tank, a majority of Americans say they distrust social-media firms. Mr\nZuckerberg and his industry need to change, fast.","The\naddiction game","Facebook's business relies on\nthree elements: keeping users glued to their screens, collecting data about\ntheir behaviour and convincing advertisers to pay billions of dollars to reach\nthem with targeted ads. The firm has an incentive to promote material that\ngrabs attention and to sell ads to anyone. Its culture melds a ruthless pursuit\nof profit with a Panglossian and narcissistic belief in its own virtue. Mr\nZuckerberg controls the firm's voting rights. Clearly, he gets too little\ncriticism.","In the latest fiasco, it emerged that in 2013 an academic in\nBritain built a questionnaire app for Facebook users, which\n270,000 people answered. They in turn had 50m Facebook friends. Data on all\nthese people then ended up with CA. (Full disclosure: The Economist once used\nCA for a market-research project.) Facebook says that it could\nnot happen again and that the academic and CA broke its rules; both deny doing anything\nwrong. Regulators in Europe and America are investigating.Facebook knew of the problem\nin 2015, but it did not alert individual users. Although nobody knows how much\nCA benefited Mr Trump's campaign, the fuss has been amplified by the left's\ndisbelief that he could have won the election fairly.","But that does not give Facebook a defence. The\nepisode fits an established pattern of sloppiness towards privacy, tolerance of\ninaccuracy and reluctance to admit mistakes. In early 2017 Mr Zuckerberg\ndismissed the idea that fake news had influenced the election as \"pretty\ncrazy\". In September Facebook said Kremlin-linked\nfirms had spent a mere $100,000 to buy 3,000 adverts on its platform, failing\nat first to mention that 150m users had seen free posts by Russian operatives.\nIt has also repeatedly misled advertisers about its user statistics.","Facebook is not about to be\nbanned or put out of business, but the chances of a regulatory backlash are\ngrowing. Europe is inflicting punishment by a thousand cuts, from digital taxes\nto antitrust cases. And distrustful users are switching off. The American\ncustomer base of Facebook's core social network has stagnated since June 2017. Its share\nof America's digital advertising market is forecast to dip this year for the\nfirst time. The network effect that made Facebook ever more\nattractive to new members as it grew could work in reverse if it starts to\nshrink. Facebook is worth $493bn, but only has $14bn of physical assets.\nIts value is intangible--and, potentially, ephemeral.","If Mr Zuckerberg wants to do right by the public and his firm,\nhe must rebuild trust. So far he has promised to audit some apps, restrict\ndevelopers' access to data still further, and help people control which apps\nhave access to their data.","That doesn't go nearly far enough. Facebook needs a full,\nindependent examination of its approach to content, privacy and data, including\nits role in the 2016 election and the Brexit referendum. This should be made\npublic. Each year Facebook should publish a report on its conduct that sets out\neverything from the prevalence of fake news to privacy breaches.","Next, Facebook and other tech firms need to open up to outsiders, safely\nand methodically. They should create an industry ombudsman--call it the Data\nRights Board. Part of its job would be to set and enforce the rules by which\naccredited independent researchers look inside platforms without threatening\nusers' privacy. Software is being developed with this in mind (see Science\nsection). The likes of Facebook raise big questions. How does micro-targeting skew\npolitical campaigns? What biases infect facial-recognition algorithms? Better\nthey be answered with evidence instead of outrage.","The board or something like it could also act as a referee for\ncomplaints, and police voluntary data-protection protocols. Facebook, for example, is\nplanning to comply worldwide with some of the measures contained in a new\nEuropean law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. Among other\nthings, this will give users more power to opt out of being tracked online and\nto stop their information being shared with third parties. Adherence to such rules\nneeds to be closely monitored.","Thumbs\ndown","Tech has experience of acting collectively to solve problems.\nStandards on hardware and software, and the naming of internet domains, are\nagreed on jointly. Facebook's rivals may be wary but, if the industry does not come up with\na joint solution, a government clampdown will become inevitable.","Facebook seems to think it\nonly needs to tweak its approach. In fact it, and other firms that hoover up\nconsumer data, should assume that their entire business model is at risk. As\nusers become better informed, the alchemy of taking their data without paying\nand manipulating them for profit may die. Firms may need to compensate people\nfor their data or let them pay to use platforms ad-free. Profits won't come as\neasily, but the alternative is stark. If Facebook ends up as a\nregulated utility with its returns on capital capped, its earnings may drop by\n80%.

Frankly there is much to be concerned about.","There is the unauthorised use of apps to harvest the Facebook profiles of the friends of survey takers, and the seeming willingness of Facebook to turn a blind eye to such activity for years until they were caught with their hands in the metaphorical cookie jar yesterday. It also appears that Facebook was fully aware that the data was being used in violation of the terms of their agreement since a Guardian report from 2015 said as much.","So, given all the controversy, everything today can be boiled down to one simple question. Can social media data be used to manipulate your feelings and make you vote for the next Manchurian Candidate? One would think so by reading the news reports and surfing Youtube. However, I'm a skeptical sort by nature, so I'd like to take a walk through what exactly Cambridge Analytica was up to, and what Facebook data actually brings to the table.","A bit of background for the uninitiated.","In 2014, Cambridge Analytica had cut a deal with Steve Bannon and the Mercer Family to help Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign, but, “Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense.”[2] Cambridge Analytica didn’t have enough data to build their targeting models, needed the data quickly, and decided to harvest it off Facebook.","I’ve spent the bulk of the last 48 hours combing through the publications of the professor’s research that Cambridge Analytica has used as the basis for their approach to “psychographics”. It seems that, in all the smoke and fire around the news today, some key points about the actual demographics of Facebook users and their data are being overlooked. Let me explain.","Who uses Facebook, really?","According to the Guardian,[3] Cambridge Analytica based its work and strategy initially on data collected off an app called myPersonality, made by two professors from Cambridge, David J. Stillwell, and Michal Kosinski. The app linked to Facebook data and collected user and personal network information.","According to their research, “The Facebook population is still predominantly young, and so are myPersonality users. The average participant is 23.5 years old and nearly half of them (47%) are between 18 and 24 years old”[4]","The users are overwhelmingly female as they are 2/3rds of all the data, and 40% of that data is from women who are 24 years of age or younger. Men in total make up only one-third of the entire database, one can obviously conclude that men are far less ‘into’ Facebook than women. Only 4% of the dataset was collected from people aged 45 years or older, the age of the overwhelming majority of US voters in 2016.[5]","Let’s stop for a second and think about this data. There is ample research which shows that Trump won by having a near landslide of white, non-college educated voters (assumed to be men… we’ll get to that in a second) in areas of the country where manufacturing is declining.[6] Given the reality of the Facebook user data, it is overwhelmingly populated with females of 24 years of age or younger; would it even be possible to construct a campaign at the individual level from that user data to build the result that Trump had above? Trump won with populations where the Facebook dataset, at an initial glance, is particularly weak – white middle aged working class men.","Are we missing something? In fact, in 2016 Trump also won BIG among white, non-college educated women 62% to 34%, nearly a 2 to 1 margin.[7] What if we were to look at other research that has sliced the data by online behaviour to see if there is something to this?","Social media pageviews peak for 15 year olds, but this usage plateaus well into middle age, the usage is flat for a long time. 40 year olds, while not as user heavy as 15 year olds, still have nearly the same page views as 20 year olds.","As well, social media usage appears to be driven by education level as well as age. In fact, there is nearly a 20% drop in pageviews between someone in high school and a person with a post graduate degree. Again, we also see that females are heavier users of social media than men by 10% overall, which also lines-up with the myPersonality Facebook data we discussed earlier.","What is also interesting in the 2012 browsing behavior study is that the higher your income, the less likely you are to spend time on social media. So, this data in total shows that non-college educated women are the heaviest users, on average, of social media. Trump did extremely well with white working class women, let's keep digging.","In 2013, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, published another study on their ability to predict a person’s behaviour from their Facebook likes. They developed a model that, \"correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85% of cases. For the personality trait Openness, prediction accuracy is close to the test–retest accuracy of a standard personality test.”","Building upon this work, another study by the team in 2015 highlighted that they had further improved their model targeting. If the user had 227 likes or more in their profile, \"accuracy is significantly better than that of an average human judge (z = 3.68, P < 0.001) and comparable with an average spouse, the best of human judges (r = 0.58, z = −1.68, P = 0.09). The peak computer performance observed in this study reached r = 0.66 for participants with more than 500 Likes.” In other words, in users with 227 likes or more, the model would be as good or better than a spouse at predicting a person’s preference and personality type.","Given all of the above, building a political campaign in 2016 influencing individuals using Facebook data would have probably been based on several factors. Was the target black or white, male or female, Democrat or Republican? What was the size of their social network, and their level of trait Openness? If the person had more than 227 likes in their Facebook profile, it may have also been theoretically possible to build some targeted content to attempt to sway their behaviour based on this information.","Does this all mean that the Trump campaign was targeting white working class females with social media tools to try to influence them? Given the above research studies, this was where they probably had the most accurate data from Facebook. But would that have been enough to win the entire presidency? Is this the ‘intelligence’, the magic bullet that put Trump over the top using Cambridge Analytica?","The theory is plausible. However, there is still one issue that can’t easily be reasoned away.","What about Ted Cruz?","Cambridge Analytica was actually paid by the election committee of Ted Cruz, Trump’s competition in the presidential primaries. Ted Cruz lost the nomination to Trump, and according to the New York Times[8], “The Trump efforts drew on legacy psychographics built for the Cruz campaign.” As the Facebook dataset used by the Cruz campaign became the backbone of the analytics used for Trump, if Cruz lost, how good was Cambridge Analytica in the first place?","According to Rick Tyler, Ted Cruz's former campaign spokesman, “What [Cambridge Analytica] had promised and delivered fell short. We were paying a premium for something we thought was a strategic advantage and it turned out to have no strategic value at all.”[9] This is hardly a ringing endorsement, nor evidence that Cambridge Analytica was the great William Cecil working in the shadows as a grand manipulative puppet master of the US election.","Writing this article does leave me with one question. How much of our daily life is now being dictated to and tailored by analytics companies working with Facebook data, based primarily on the social media behaviour of 15- 24 year old females?","Ultimately, it won’t matter if we delete our cookies and don’t use Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}
{"originalurl":"https://corporateeurope.org/power-lobbies/2017/10/big-data-watching-you","title":"Big Data is watching you | Corporate Europe Observatory","text":["Big Data is watching you","The industry lobby battle against ePrivacy","This week, MEPs on the Civil Rights Committee will vote on the ePrivacy regulation, which will determine how secure our data is when we are online. For the past 16 months, industry lobbies, including all those who collect or use citizens’ personal online data for advertising purposes, have been vigorously opposing new proposals on ePrivacy. On the other side of the debate, digital rights campaigners demand that citizens should enjoy optimum data privacy when online.","Industry has used tried and tested techniques straight out of the lobbyists’ playbook to influence the outcome of ePrivacy deliberations in the Commission and the Parliament. These tactics have included one-to-one lobby meetings, coordinating industry sign-up letters, mobilising corporate members, commissioning research to support industry positions, and holding or sponsoring elite events. A pro-privacy version of the Commission’s proposal which was leaked in December 2016 pumped further adrenalin into the corporate campaign, concerned about how its bottom line would be affected. Evidence indicates that member states in the Council such as Germany could be promoting industry positions.","Key to some industry lobbyists’ strategy has been the attempt to reframe the debate so that it is not about privacy but instead about media plurality, combatting fake news, and even the future of the internet, and they have regularly woven key EU buzzwords and policy mantras such as “better regulation” and “innovation” into their appeals to policy-makers.","Overall, one Parliamentary insider has characterised ePrivacy as","“one of the worst lobby campaigns I have ever seen”.","What is ePrivacy?","“We’ve lost control of our personal data,” said Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the web on its 28th anniversary earlier this year.","Everytime you are online, via a laptop, computer, or smartphone, you are under commercial surveillance. Your digital data including the content of your emails, the websites you browse, and the purchases you have made, together with metadata (data which includes to whom, when, and where your communications are sent) is monitored and collected, including via tracking cookies and other mechanisms. This sensitive information is then sold on and used to target commercial advertising or political messaging at you, and can be used by governments too. EPrivacy must therefore ensure the confidentiality of your online communications. This can be done, for example, by banning interference in your communications (calls, chats, texts, Skype calls…); by making sure that settings on new equipment and software are designed and set at the highest privacy level ‘by default’; and that consumers who refuse to be tracked cannot be banned from visiting particular websites.","ePrivacy regulation","It was always clear that the topic of ePrivacy would be the focus of serious lobbying. Part of the Digital Single Market initiative, and closely related to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which was updated in 2016 after a long lobby battle (you can read Corporate Europe Observatory’s analysis of aspects of corporate influence on the GDPR here), the new ePrivacy regulation updates existing provisions (dating from 2002 and 2009) to take account of new and emerging technologies and platforms, and to harmonise it with the GDPR.","On ePrivacy, industry does not always speak with one voice. Telecoms companies are already subject to the current ePrivacy rules but newer platforms which enable you to communicate online such as Facebook, Google, WhatsApp, and Skype are not. Telecoms companies, already unhappy about the ePrivacy laws they must adhere to, would like them to be scarpped. Failing that, they at least want to level the playing field so that newer providers have to follow the same rules. The newer platforms would obviously prefer to keep things much as they currently are, and for ePrivacy rules not to apply to them.","Meanwhile the companies that provide online advertising fear that ePrivacy changes will undercut their current business model. This model relies on tracking users’ web-browsing, analysing metadata and content in communications, and monitoring the use of TVs and other devices, so that advertising can be targetted. The online advertising and marketing lobbies have closely collaborated on the ePrivacy dossier with newspaper and magazine publishers who are increasingly reliant on online advertising revenue derived in this way. Facebook and Google, to name just two, are also heavily reliant on surveillance-based advertising revenue, earned by monitoring users’ electronic communications.","On the other side of the debate, the European Data Protection Supervisor (the EU's independent data protection authority), digital rights campaigners and consumer advocates point to the fundamental rights laid out in the EU treaties, especially on data privacy and the right to a private life. BEUC points out that “consumers should have the possibility to use online services without being under constant commercial surveillance”. Public opinion appears to back this approach. In the Commission’s consultation on ePrivacy, 81 per cent of the individual citizens who responded demanded ‘privacy by default’ settings to be activated on all new IT equipment. According to a Eurobarometer survey, 89 per cent of its respondents agreed with that suggestion. By contrast, a majority of industry respondents to the Commission’s consultation favoured self- or co-regulation instead.","€1,000,000 - €1,249,999","€300,000 - €399,999","(2016)","2.75","9","Industry lobbyists warm up","In the run up to the publication of the Commission's ePrivacy regulation in January 2017 there were a host of industry lobby initiatives following on from the Commission’s consultation process. And while some individual companies held behind-the-scenes lobby meetings with senior Commission officials during 2016 (Deutsche Telekom had five meetings; Facebook, two; Google, three; and Microsoft, five), many left it to their respective trade associations to lead the public charge.","Large parts of the tech and telecoms industries have been opposed to the whole concept of a revised ePrivacy law. Trade associations representing app developers, publishers, telecoms companies, advertisers, and other digital service providers publicly united to demand that the ePrivacy Directive was simply repealed. A statement issued in July 2016 included 12 trade associations who argued that because the new proposal would overlap with the GDPR, the existing ePrivacy directive (which industry often refers to as the “cookie law” to undermine its privacy value) could be simply scrapped rather than updated. This was an ironic argument for industry to make, considering that many of them had lobbied hard (albeit mostly unsuccessfully) to gut the GDPR. The lobby groups were careful to reference REFIT, part of the Commission’s controversial deregulation drive, and another EU buzz word “innovation”, in their argumentation as to why a new ePrivacy law is not needed.","Telecoms trade body ETNO (European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association) followed up in early September with a study conducted on its behalf by law firm DLA Piper which (surprise, surprise) backed ETNO’s view that “the ePrivacy Directive is outdated and no longer needed.… Most of its provisions, if not all, should therefore be repealed.” Commissioning studies from think tanks or law firms which end up supporting your case is a familiar lobby tactic in Brussels.","Another familiar tactic is organising high-profile conferences. The invitation-only ETNO conference in September 2016 saw Digital Single Market Commissioner Andrus Ansip and (then) Digital Economy Commissioner Günther Oettinger, together with Roberto Viola (Director-General of the lead department for ePrivacy, DG Connect) speaking to the telecoms industry. Just a couple of months later, a further telecoms industry conference, this time organised by ECTA (European Competitive Telecommunications Association), brought together Ansip, Viola, and many of the key industry lobbyists again. Yet another conference in December 2016 specifically on data protection and ePrivacy, sponsored by Microsoft and Deutsche Telekom among others, brought together lobbyists, DG Connect officials, and Věra Jourová, another EU Commissioner with oversight of this topic, thanks to her consumer protection portfolio.","But not all interactions took place in these large fora. An evening meeting between Oettinger, the board of the magazine publishers association EMMA, and a delegation of European publishers sounds rather more intimate, and was then followed by a Q&A with EMMA members. Other invitation-only events, and private lobby meetings all provided ample opportunities for industry to ensure that the Commission knew its positions on ePrivacy during the proposal drafting phase.","In 2016 there were at least 41 lobby meetings held with Commissioners Ansip or Oettinger, their cabinet members, or Director-General Roberto Viola, which clearly included discussions on ePrivacy. Of these 41 meetings, 36 (88 per cent) were with corporate interests and only 5 were with civil society, indicating a high degree of corporate bias. This very much fits with the pattern of corporate privileged access previously exposed by ALTER-EU which showed that Oettinger and Ansip, responsible for ePrivacy in 2016, were the Commissioners with the second and fourth highest proportions of corporate meetings, with 83 per cent and 78 per cent respectively. In fact, as Politico has pointed out, Oettinger, who “won the gratitude of some of Europe’s telecom giants and big media publishers”, continued to meet with lobbyists from the tech world in 2017 despite being appointed to an entirely different portfolio (the EU budget) in January.","However, the figure of 41 meetings is likely to be an under-estimate. Commission-organised stakeholder roundtables do not seem to be included in this list, while many other private lobby meetings may well have touched upon these issues (on data protection or the Digital Single Market, for example), but did not include ePrivacy on the reported agenda. This number also excludes the meetings held by officials not subject to the Commission’s proactive transparency rules, namely the entirety of DG Connect, aside from its Director-General.","On 23 November 2016, Ansip met with a group of seven industry lobby groups - interactive advertising (IAB Europe), publishers (EPC), magazine publishers (EMMA), newspaper publishers (ENPA), communications agencies (EACA), direct and interactive marketing (FEDMA), and interactive digital advertising (EDAA) - specifically on ePrivacy. This meeting followed a joint letter to Ansip and Oettinger from IAB Europe and EMMA, with the support of over 90 European publishers, which typifies the attempts of the industry to reframe the political debate on ePrivacy. The advocates of the letter argue: “Media plurality, and ultimately functioning democracies, depend on media having diverse revenue streams. These must include advertising.” The letter invokes moral arguments to defend what is, in fact, simply a current business model based on tracking, and implies that it is the only viable form of online advertising. (A recent blog by digital rights campaign EDRi dissects the key arguments of proponents of the tracking-based advertising model and discusses alternatives.) The industry letter, once again, cites the Commission’s Better Regulation (deregulatory) agenda, a key EU mantra, and argues for voluntary rather than legally-binding regulation.","Leaked proposal provokes lobby flurry","By December 2016, the ePrivacy debate was really hotting up, and then a leaked version of the Commission’s proposed regulation (complete with spelling mistakes, a sure indication it was not the final version) appeared on the Politico website around 12 December 2016. While digital rights activists mostly welcomed the proposals, there was another flurry of furious lobbying when industry discovered the leaked draft contained several proposals which were anathema to it. (For an overview of the leaked proposal, The International Association of Privacy Professionals and The Data Protection Network published analyses at the time.)","IAB Europe led industry reaction to the leak, telling the Financial Times, without any sense of hyperbole, that the leaked Commission proposal was “putting at risk the entire internet as we know it”, a reference to the proposal in the leaked version that users should give prior permission to receive targetted advertising.","Days after the leak, the consumer rights umbrella group BEUC wrote to Ansip and Oettinger and President Juncker on ePrivacy. Without referencing the leaked proposal directly, BEUC expressed support for some of its key elements and held a meeting with Oettinger on 20 December which included discussions on ePrivacy. But BEUC was seriously out-gunned by the numbers of corporate lobbyists accessing decision-makers around this time.","On 19 December 2016, an informal coalition of at least 14 heavyweight industry trade associations met with Commissioner Ansip directly. This meeting was fortuitously scheduled, coming only a few days after the leak which had been causing such a stir. While the meeting was ostensibly about the implementation of the GDPR, it would have been a good opportunity to raise the leaked proposal. Attendees included the European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT), telecoms trade body ETNO, BusinessEurope, DigitalEurope, IAB Europe, CCIA, FEDMA, and others.","In fact industry lobbied all the way up to Christmas 2016 to push its agenda. On 20 December, ETNO and GSMA publicly wrote to Commissioners Timmermans, Ansip, Oettinger, and Jourová criticising what they called the “restrictive and conservative policy approach” in the leaked regulation, including “the reliance on consent on consent”.","On 22 December, DigitalEurope issued a public statement to criticise the leaked proposal as “undermining the balance of the digital ecosystem… disproportionate and… likely to be ineffective”. The statement made 11 separate criticisms of the leaked draft, including on ‘privacy by design’ and cookies. It was signed by 12 trade associations including AmCham EU, EACA, EDiMA, FEDMA, and IAB Europe.","On the same day, a separate but overlapping group of trade associations, this time of European publishers, the digital advertising industry, and direct marketers, and which included EMMA, ENPA, EACA, FEDMA, and IAB Europe, wrote to Ansip and Oettinger to express their concerns especially about “the proposals on browser settings, third party cookies and privacy by design”. The letter repeated the demand that they would just prefer to see the whole ePrivacy rules binned, “as the first, best option”.","A freedom of information request to the Commission to request minutes of industry lobby meetings on ePrivacy has remained (at the time of writing) unanswered, four months after it was tabled, so we do not know the detail of what was discussed in any of the meetings detailed above. But it is safe to assume that by the time ePrivacy officials and Commissioners left for their 2016 Christmas break, they would all have been exceedingly clear about industry’s demands.","Commission’s final proposal","On 10 January 2017 the Commission published its final proposal and some key things had changed since the leaked draft. Absent were proposals to ensure default ePrivacy settings on computer equipment, and to allow the equivalent of US-style class actions to make mass privacy complaints. Included was a weaker definition of metadata.","La Quadrature du Net, an NGO defending digital rights, said at the time: “This regulation proposal does have some interesting elements but it doesn't challenge the economic model of the digital industry based on the exploitation of personal data. So, last minute concessions given to advertisers and telecoms are already too big considering there are still months left of negotiations where lobbies of the industry will have all the time to undermine the text. At this time, the proposal doesn't address the concern of EU citizens on the protection of their electronic communications.”","EDRi took a similar line, stating that the text “seems to have [been] watered down considerably… the official draft proposal released in January 2017 falls far short of that earlier text in certain key areas” but also noted that the “European Commission has resisted the most extreme demands from certain parts of industry”.","It is impossible to say exactly what impact all the heavy corporate lobbying had on the final Commission proposal. It seems that the changes between the leaked and final versions were instigated at the Cabinet (rather than DG Connect) level and that the advertising lobby had been especially influential. Certainly lobby groups promoting the tracking-based advertising model were very active during this period, and a comparison of the leaked and final proposals makes it clear that the Commission did change the text in ways with which industry lobbies would have approved. The leak occurred during the intra-Commission consultation on the proposal and it seems a plausible, although unproved, theory that the leak came from pro-industry forces within the Commission who were keen to generate sufficient outrage from industry so as to extinguish proposals seen as being too pro-privacy. The final proposal indicates that industry lobbyists won the day on some important issues.","Nonetheless, advertising lobby group IAB Europe maintained its hard-line stance in its post-release public statement which continued to demand the “repealing [of the] outdated and unnecessary cookie law”. Similarly EMMA and ENPA (representing magazine and newspaper publishers respectively) seemed angry that their lobbying, which they referred to as “a significant number of meetings and exchanges with the European Commission”, had not delivered what they wanted.","Industry lobby switches focus to MEPs","The industry lobby bandwagon now headed to the European Parliament where Estonia’s Marju Lauristin MEP (Social Democrat) became Rapporteur on the dossier for the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) committee. As a previous Shadow Rapporteur on the GDPR, Lauristin was already well versed in the arguments on both sides of the debate and was likely to steer through a pro-privacy approach. With Lauristin returning to national Estonian politics by the end of the year, completing the report rapidly became an urgent task.","Throughout 2017 industry has maintained its lobby pressure via a series of one-to-one lobby meetings, sponsored events, industry sign-up letters, cocktail debates, and roundtable discussions with MEPs. MEPs on the relevant committees were being bombarded with demands from industry to read briefings, hold lobby meetings, and table draft amendments. If the lengthy GDPR debate was the biggest ever EU lobby battle on tech issues, the ePrivacy dossier has run it a close second and the lobbying has been intense. Rapporteur Lauristin and her staff have held over 140 meetings with lobbyists on all sides of the debate and in total, over 800 amendments have been tabled. La Quadrature du Net analysed the amendments and highlighted a cluster of MEPs from the EPP and ECR groups (centre right/ right wing) who adopted a pro-industry, anti-privacy perspective.","In early summer 2017 MEP Rapporteurs and lobbyists packed into a small room in the Parliament for one of a series of roundtables to try to move the ePrivacy debate forward. Every seat was taken and as the temperatures in the cramped room rose, so did tempers. Some industry lobbyists’ behaviour at that meeting was subsequently described as “rude”, “impolite”, and even “aggressive”, especially when they interrupted other speakers, or made dismissive comments about others’ interventions.","The Digital Assembly 2017 was held in Valletta in June. Organised by the Commission and the Maltese Presidency of the Council of the EU, it provided a lobby opportunity for those working on various aspects of the Digital Single Market. Packed with Commission officials, member state and permanent representation staff, and key MEPs on the ePrivacy dossier (including Lauristin and Shadow Rapporteur Michał Boni), the tech industry lobby was out in full force. While NGOs represented a handful of delegates, DigitalEurope sent six; Google, seven; Microsoft, four; Vodafone, five; Telefónica, four; and Apple, three; while a number of lobby firms including APCO, Cabinet DN, Cambre, Edelman, FTI Consulting, Hanover, and Kreab, were also among the delegates.","Also in June, the Developers Alliance and IAB Europe held a round-table discussion in the European Parliament on “The impact of the proposed ePrivacy Regulation on the data-driven ecosystem”, with MEPs Michał Boni and Daniel Dalton. The event was framed as how the draft ePrivacy regulation would impact upon “innovative companies”, innovation being a key EU policy mantra which is often used to mean that nothing must get in the way of business doing business.","In a blog to review the event IAB Europe’s Chief Executive slammed Lauristin’s draft LIBE committee report as taking an “extreme approach”, and asked whether the new ePrivacy rules, especially in the light of the MEP’s report, would “kill the online advertising business model” or “just handicap it”.","In fact, by criticising the “environment of hysteria over tracking that currently grips Brussels” in a different blog, it seemed as if IAB Europe was not afraid to have a pop at anyone with opposing views. This seems to include the European Data Protection Supervisor, the EU's independent data protection authority. It has supported tougher privacy protections throughout this process and has recently taken on the arguments used by supporters of surveillance-based advertising.","By September 2017, pro-privacy MEPs’ frustration with industry lobbies publicly surfaced at a debate on “How the new privacy rules might impact a free and independent press”, organised by EMMA (magazine media) and EDAA (interactive digital advertising). According to IAPP’s report on the event, LIBE Rapporteur Lauristin told industry:","“It is important to have a dialogue, but I am sorry to say it feels like we are listening to you, trying to take into account what you say, and yet we see no change in your responses.”","“Privacy is a fundamental right. It is on a par with other fundamental rights, it’s not a political position. So whatever business models you develop you will have to respect that right. It is not negotiable. Full stop.… Every time we pass a piece of legislation, I hear the same cries of alarm saying it is going to kill this or that industry. If that was true every time, there would not be a single business left in Europe, so let’s not dramatise.”","Even Martin Selmayr, President Juncker’s Chief of Staff, has warned industry that lobbying around exaggerated claims would not work, according to a report in Politico. “I’ve seen this ‘end-of-the-world scenario’ before… I’d advise not to go into another five years of lobbying”, in a reference to the GDPR, he apparently told tech lobbyists.","All in all, the approach of some industry lobbyists has really alienated some MEPs. A parliamentary source speaking to Corporate Europe Observatory anonymously characterised overall industry lobbying on ePrivacy – especially by the online advertising and media lobbies – as “always aggressive” and as “one of the worse I have ever seen”.","While the civil liberties (LIBE) committee has lead responsibility for ePrivacy, several other committees have now finalised their opinions. EDRi and La Quadrature du Net criticised the final opinion of the Internal Market and Consumer Affairs Committee (IMCO) for supporting the bypassing of users’ consent. EDRi criticised the “avalanche of broadly pro-Google lobbying” focussed on IMCO which led to its final opinion reducing the scope of the ePrivacy regulation and weakening the safeguards for citizens’.","The Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) Committee has “proposed a mix of positive and negative changes to the text”, according to EDRi, while La Quadrature du Net called it “pretty much the same calamity” as the IMCO report.","A third committee, Legal Affairs (JURI), has also produced an opinion. The Rapporteur, centre-right MEP Axel Voss, produced a draft opinion which was packed full of pro-industry amendments and argued that the ePrivacy proposal should “refrain from focusing on consent”. In the end, Voss’ report was so heavily amended by pro-privacy MEPs that he asked to have his name removed from it.","Member states get ready for ePrivacy Council debate","As is usually the case in EU decision-making, the situation in the Council is more opaque than in the Parliament. Member states are handling this dossier slowly and delegations are still checking legal issues, including how the ePrivacy regulation fits with the GDPR. A final Council position is not expected until the end of the year. But there are some worrying signs, including that this dossier is being handled by telecoms officials from member states (via the Telecommunications Working Party) which could imply that positions are more likely to be pro-industry. By contrast, the GDPR was handled by data protection officials.","The Council debate on privacy issues has been underway for some time. A May 2017 progress report from the (Maltese) Council Presidency stated that “A number of delegations would welcome more thorough analysis of the impact... on specific market players, in particular on online advertising companies and/or on business models using third-party cookies.” A discussion was due to be held on 10 July to specifically discuss overlaps with the GDPR and cookies; the Council has said that minutes of this and other meetings of the Telecommunications Working Party do not exist.","Over the summer of 2017 delegations shared their emerging positions with other member states. According to papers passed to Corporate Europe Observatory, a group of countries (Greece, Portugal, Latvia) have made proposals to toughen up the Commission’s privacy proposals.","However Germany is already mooting a possible dilution. A position paper on ePrivacy drafted by the German Government which was dated August 2017 and circulated to member state delegations, stated that provisions on tracking cookies and consent needed to be “carefully reviewed and be discussed in much more detail”. It continued: “These are provisions are highly significant for both companies and private individuals alike. These provisions need to protect the right to informational self determination. At the same time, they must not preclude the development and use of legitimate business models; this notably applies to business models that ensure access to information that is influential on user’s opinion. The relevant provisions ought to be practical and reflect the interests of users and service providers alike.” [Emphasis added.]","This will be a red flag to digital rights activists, but will perhaps not come as any great surprise. Corporate Europe Observatory has previously written about the lobby influence of the German publishers’ lobby, the power of the Spanish telecoms sector, and the willingness of these member states to absorb industry positions as their own. The BDI (the Federation of German Industries) has recently lobbied MEPs on the LIBE committee about what it called the “disproportionate provisions” on ePrivacy currently being discussed.","The most recent draft of the (Estonian) Council Presidency’s proposal on ePrivacy, dated September 2017, does not make substantial proposals for change to the privacy provisions, although proposing to extend the period of time for which users might be reminded to check their privacy settings from 6 to 12 months, is perhaps a worrying sign.","Furthermore, there is some suggestion that member states will insert new security provisions to require companies to retain consumers’ data, which will be controversial with both MEPs and citizens. However, overall the jury remains out in terms of how Council will finally position itself on ePrivacy.","Next steps","MEPs on the LIBE committee will vote on 19 October 2017 on MEP Lauristin’s report, whose pro-privacy approach is expected to remain intact despite the industry lobbies’ overwhelming effort to undermine it.","Parliamentary insiders say that even at this late stage lobbyists are continuing to contact MEPs, some on a daily basis. Just days before the LIBE vote, industry lobbyists (in the form of the Industry Coalition for Data Protection which includes AmCham EU, DigitalEurope, IAB Europe, EACA, EDiMA, FEDMA, and others) circulated yet another open letter which warns MEPs that they should “carefully consider the practical implications both for businesses and consumers of the proposed ePrivacy Regulation text before a vote”. On Twitter, pro-privacy MEPs such as Rapporteur Lauristin and Green group Shadow Rapporteur Jan Philipp Albrecht have had to fend off angry industry lobbyists.","Meanwhile IAB Europe, EMMA, ENPA, EACA, FEDMA and others have now produced a series of short videos likening the ePrivacy proposal to a “bad movie” and depicting a future world where ePrivacy has undermined the fight against ‘fake news’, and citizens have been left feeling “exhausted” and “confused” because they have had to consent to privacy settings.","Luckily EU decision-makers, so far, have not caved into industry’s scaremongering. While the Commission acquiesced to some corporate lobby demands in its final draft of January 2017, it did enough to ensure that industry’s demands to firstly jettison the whole dossier and then to render it toothless were not implemented. MEPs, under the leadership of Lauristin, have fought back against the corporate lobbyists. But there remains an open question as to how the Council will handle ePrivacy. This is likely to depend upon how successful national corporate lobbyists will be in bending the ear of sympathetic member state officials.","Looking forward to the trilogue phase of this dossier, it will be vital that all EU decision-makers – MEPs, member state officials, the Commission – remain alert to the claims of corporate lobbyists, and take a particularly sceptical approach towards those who insist that online privacy and a flourishing internet cannot co-exist.","Update 19 October 2017","Today, MEPs on the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) committee voted to accept the report of rapporteur Marju Lauristin MEP on ePrivacy, with 31 votes in favour compared to 24 against. A series of compromise amendments had been reached between key political groups in recent days, but the centre-right EPP had refused to endorse both these and the entire report.","Digital rights activists have broadly welcomed the results which include privacy-by-default settings in new software, and an end to “cookie walls” which companies can use to deny access to their website or service if a consumer does not consent to being tracked.","EDRi said: “Despite a huge lobbying effort to water down the proposal, the Committee voted for clear, privacy-friendly rules. We welcome this approach, as it will not just protect citizens, but promote competition and innovation as well”. Consumer rights organisation BEUC said: “It's alarming that the online companies who claim to be the trendsetters and the engine of the digital economy cling to an advertising business model based on snooping on people. It is a great step that the European Parliament today has put consumers in the driving seat again.”","However La Quadrature du Net pointed to weaknesses in the report, including allowing websites to track users without their consent for “web audience measuring” and allowing companies to track devices in the streets without our consent.","Industry responded in expected ways. IAB Europe defended the EPP minority which tried to block the report, and said it was “mystifying” that a majority of MEPs did not support a “vibrant, independent media that can hold power to account”, once again trying to reframe the debate away from ePrivacy. ETNO tried to reframe the issue around “innovation and consumer choice” saying it regretted today’s vote.","With the Council next in line to agree its position, before the trilogue can start, we can be sure that the industry lobbying will only intensify.","Update 24 October 2017","\"By November, our communications secrecy could be dead all across the EU...\"","Today, centre-right MEPs have secured the votes needed to send MEP Lauristin's report to the Strasbourg plenary on Thursday (26th) for a full vote. If a majority vote to re-open the dossier, new amendments can then be tabled. Those following the dossier inside and outside the Parliament have confirmed to CEO that \"lobby efforts are going through the roof right now\" and that corporate lobby \"campaigning started immediately after the LIBE vote\" last week.","Update 30 October 2017","Last week MEPs in plenary voted to support the LIBE mandate to enter into trilogue with the other institutions on ePrivacy. As rapporteur Marju Lauristin MEP said:","\"Today’s vote is a victory for citizen’s rights over the lobbying efforts of big business.\"","Lauristin is now due to return to Estonian national politics and she will be replaced as rapporteur by Birgit Sippel who said:","\"There have been many myths circulating about this report spread by industrial lobbyists who are engaged in a misleading campaign. We are pleased that the majority of the Parliament has seen sense and allowed us to move forward with these important new rules.\"","Get our monthly newsletter","Follow us on social media","The political climate in the Czech Republic has grown increasingly repressive following the election of oligarch Andrej Babiš as prime minister in October 2017.

Wylie said that Bannon especially valued input from queer people because he saw them as cultural leaders (he ascribes Bannon's affinity for Milo Yiannopoulos to this belief).","Wylie refutes many of the claims made about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about which information they had, when they had it, and how they used it, making them out to be liars -- at a key moment in which the companies and their industries are coming under close political scrutiny and public disrepute (if politics are downstream from culture, they're in serious trouble).","And through it all, Wylie and I, plus a handful of editors and a small, international group of academics and researchers, have known that – at least in 2014 – that certainly wasn’t the case, because Wylie has the paper trail. In our first phone call, he told me he had the receipts, invoices, emails, legal letters – records that showed how, between June and August 2014, the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users had been harvested. Most damning of all, he had a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately.","Going public involves an enormous amount of risk. Wylie is breaking a non-disclosure agreement and risks being sued. He is breaking the confidence of Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer.","It’s taken a rollercoaster of a year to help get Wylie to a place where it’s possible for him to finally come forward. A year in which Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of investigations on both sides of the Atlantic – Robert Mueller’s in the US, and separate inquiries by the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK, both triggered in February 2017, after the Observer’s first article in this investigation.","It has been a year, too, in which Wylie has been trying his best to rewind – to undo events that he set in motion. Earlier this month, he submitted a dossier of evidence to the Information Commissioner’s Office and the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit. He is now in a position to go on the record: the data nerd who came in from the cold."],"isopubdate":""}

This idiom reflects the ever closer union between the State Department and Silicon Valley, as personified by Mr. Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, and Mr. Cohen, a former adviser to Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton who is now director of Google Ideas.","The authors met in occupied Baghdad in 2009, when the book was conceived. Strolling among the ruins, the two became excited that consumer technology was transforming a society flattened by United States military occupation. They decided the tech industry could be a powerful agent of American foreign policy.","The book proselytizes the role of technology in reshaping the world’s people and nations into likenesses of the world’s dominant superpower, whether they want to be reshaped or not. The prose is terse, the argument confident and the wisdom — banal. But this isn’t a book designed to be read. It is a major declaration designed to foster alliances.","“The New Digital Age” is, beyond anything else, an attempt by Google to position itself as America’s geopolitical visionary — the one company that can answer the question “Where should America go?” It is not surprising that a respectable cast of the world’s most famous warmongers has been trotted out to give its stamp of approval to this enticement to Western soft power. The acknowledgments give pride of place to Henry Kissinger, who along with Tony Blair and the former C.I.A. director Michael Hayden provided advance praise for the book.","In the book the authors happily take up the white geek’s burden. A liberal sprinkling of convenient, hypothetical dark-skinned worthies appear: Congolese fisherwomen, graphic designers in Botswana, anticorruption activists in San Salvador and illiterate Masai cattle herders in the Serengeti are all obediently summoned to demonstrate the progressive properties of Google phones jacked into the informational supply chain of the Western empire.","The authors offer an expertly banalized version of tomorrow’s world: the gadgetry of decades hence is predicted to be much like what we have right now — only cooler. “Progress” is driven by the inexorable spread of American consumer technology over the surface of the earth. Already, every day, another million or so Google-run mobile devices are activated. Google will interpose itself, and hence the United States government, between the communications of every human being not in China (naughty China). Commodities just become more marvelous; young, urban professionals sleep, work and shop with greater ease and comfort; democracy is insidiously subverted by technologies of surveillance, and control is enthusiastically rebranded as “participation”; and our present world order of systematized domination, intimidation and oppression continues, unmentioned, unafflicted or only faintly perturbed.","The authors are sour about the Egyptian triumph of 2011. They dismiss the Egyptian youth witheringly, claiming that “the mix of activism and arrogance in young people is universal.” Digitally inspired mobs mean revolutions will be “easier to start” but “harder to finish.” Because of the absence of strong leaders, the result, or so Mr. Kissinger tells the authors, will be coalition governments that descend into autocracies. They say there will be “no more springs” (but China is on the ropes).","The authors fantasize about the future of “well resourced” revolutionary groups. A new “crop of consultants” will “use data to build and fine-tune a political figure.”","“His” speeches (the future isn’t all that different) and writing will be fed “through complex feature-extraction and trend-analysis software suites” while “mapping his brain function,” and other “sophisticated diagnostics” will be used to “assess the weak parts of his political repertoire.”","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","The book mirrors State Department institutional taboos and obsessions. It avoids meaningful criticism of Israel and Saudi Arabia. It pretends, quite extraordinarily, that the Latin American sovereignty movement, which has liberated so many from United States-backed plutocracies and dictatorships over the last 30 years, never happened. Referring instead to the region’s “aging leaders,” the book can’t see Latin America for Cuba. And, of course, the book frets theatrically over Washington’s favorite boogeymen: North Korea and Iran.","Google, which started out as an expression of independent Californian graduate student culture — a decent, humane and playful culture — has, as it encountered the big, bad world, thrown its lot in with traditional Washington power elements, from the State Department to the National Security Agency.","Despite accounting for an infinitesimal fraction of violent deaths globally, terrorism is a favorite brand in United States policy circles. This is a fetish that must also be catered to, and so “The Future of Terrorism” gets a whole chapter. The future of terrorism, we learn, is cyberterrorism. A session of indulgent scaremongering follows, including a breathless disaster-movie scenario, wherein cyberterrorists take control of American air-traffic control systems and send planes crashing into buildings, shutting down power grids and launching nuclear weapons. The authors then tar activists who engage in digital sit-ins with the same brush.","I have a very different perspective. The advance of information technology epitomized by Google heralds the death of privacy for most people and shifts the world toward authoritarianism. This is the principal thesis in my book, “Cypherpunks.” But while Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Cohen tell us that the death of privacy will aid governments in “repressive autocracies” in “targeting their citizens,” they also say governments in “open” democracies will see it as “a gift” enabling them to “better respond to citizen and customer concerns.” In reality, the erosion of individual privacy in the West and the attendant centralization of power make abuses inevitable, moving the “good” societies closer to the “bad” ones.","The section on “repressive autocracies” describes, disapprovingly, various repressive surveillance measures: legislation to insert back doors into software to enable spying on citizens, monitoring of social networks and the collection of intelligence on entire populations. All of these are already in widespread use in the United States. In fact, some of those measures — like the push to require every social-network profile to be linked to a real name — were spearheaded by Google itself.","THE writing is on the wall, but the authors cannot see it. They borrow from William Dobson the idea that the media, in an autocracy, “allows for an opposition press as long as regime opponents understand where the unspoken limits are.” But these trends are beginning to emerge in the United States. No one doubts the chilling effects of the investigations into The Associated Press and Fox’s James Rosen. But there has been little analysis of Google’s role in complying with the Rosen subpoena. I have personal experience of these trends.","The Department of Justice admitted in March that it was in its third year of a continuing criminal investigation of WikiLeaks. Court testimony states that its targets include “the founders, owners, or managers of WikiLeaks.” One alleged source, Bradley Manning, faces a 12-week trial beginning tomorrow, with 24 prosecution witnesses expected to testify in secret.","This book is a balefully seminal work in which neither author has the language to see, much less to express, the titanic centralizing evil they are constructing. “What Lockheed Martin was to the 20th century,” they tell us, “technology and cybersecurity companies will be to the 21st.” Without even understanding how, they have updated and seamlessly implemented George Orwell’s prophecy. If you want a vision of the future, imagine Washington-backed Google Glasses strapped onto vacant human faces — forever. Zealots of the cult of consumer technology will find little to inspire them here, not that they ever seem to need it. But this is essential reading for anyone caught up in the struggle for the future, in view of one simple imperative: Know your enemy.","Julian Assange is the editor in chief of WikiLeaks and author of “Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet.”","A version of this op-ed appears in print on June 2, 2013, on Page SR4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Banality of ‘Don’t Be Evil’.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP, File)","Watch it, Facebook: new EU data rules may have broad impact","Watch it, Facebook: new EU data rules may have broad impact","By DANICA KIRKA","Mar. 26, 2018","https://apnews.com/a1e572aa153b43398187ee8acd7f7578","Link copied!","LONDON (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company's subscribers. The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","\"For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,\" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. \"I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.\"","The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized \"the right to be forgotten,\" allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","\"The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,\" said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking \"I Agree.\" The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to \"bracket off\" European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.","\"Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,\" she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. \"We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,\" it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","\"Cambridge Analytica's story sounds like a spy novel,\" he said. \"It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,\" he said. \"We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.\""],"isopubdate":""}

Cambridge Analytica operates in the U.K. and is registered in the U.S.","Bloodstream of the internet","While the practices Nix describes are relatively crude in their approach, the company also offered much more subtle approaches, which left no trace but were just as effective.","Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division told the reporter \"we just put information into the bloodstream of the internet, and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again … like a remote control.”","Turnbull added that this “has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘that’s propaganda’ because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘who’s put that out?’”","He later adds: “So we have to be very subtle, and we’ve got time to do this.”","Shadow operations","Despite being widely known about, the reach of Cambridge Analytica’s operations were not fully understood until now, given that they boast of impacting more than 200 elections around the world.","The reason is that the company uses an extensive range of tactics to hide their fingerprints on any operation they conduct.","“So often we set up, if we are working then we can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists, there are so many options we can look at. I have lots of experience in this,” Nix said.","Turnbull added at a separate meeting that operations are run “so that no record exists with our name attached to this at all, and I think we can work in that space as well.”","Intelligence gathering","When the reporter asks if Cambridge Analytica offers intelligence gathering services, Turnbull says the company has “partnerships with specialist organizations that do that kind of, that do that kind of work. So that, you can, you know who the opposition is, you know their secrets, you know their tactics.”","At another meeting, Turnbull says the people who they work with at ex-MI5 operatives who work with “private organizations whose job is to gather research.","“They will find all the skeletons in his closet quietly, discreetly, and give you a report,” he said.","Contradiction","Turnbull appears to have contradicted himself about the scope of the operation Cambridge Analytica offers to their clients. In a December meeting with the reporter, Turnbull says:","“So we’re not in the business of fake news, we’re not in the business of lying, making stuff up, and we’re not in the business of entrapment, so we wouldn’t, we wouldn’t send a pretty girl out to seduce a politician and then film them in their bedroom and then release the film. There are companies that do this but to me that crosses a line.”","Yet a month later he was present when Nix laid out the possibility of using prostitutes to entrap local officials as well as offering bribe. In the January meeting he proclaims: “I’m a master of disguise” when referring to the possibility of having someone pose as a wealthy developer.","Cover image: Alexander Nix, CEO, Cambridge Analytica, answers Matthew Freud, Founder and Chairman, Freuds, questions about 'From Mad Men to Math Men' during the final day of Web Summit in Altice Arena on November 09, 2017 in Lisbon, Portugal.

Such a tool was deployed for the first time in the French elections in 2017. “The new AI tools we built after the 2016 elections found, I think, more than 30,000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the US in the 2016 election. We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France,” he said.","“Last year in 2017 with the special election in Alabama, we deployed some new AI tools to identify fake accounts and false news, and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news, and were able to eliminate those,” Zuckerberg said.","This is for the first time that Zuckerberg has publicly talked about Facebook being allegedly used for influencing polls. “I feel a lot better about the systems now. At the same time, I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do, too. So we need to make sure that we up our game,” he said.","“This is a massive focus for us to make sure we’re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the US, but the Indian elections, the Brazilian elections, and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important,” Zuckerberg said.","With more than 250 million users, India is the largest market for Facebook. more Indians use the social media platform than Americans, which is its second largest market.","Zuckerberg’s comments come a day after the Union Minister for Law and Justice, and Electronics & Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad issued a warning to the social media company that India will take “stringent action” which could include summoning Zuckerberg, in case data of Indians is stolen.","Besides interviews, Zuckerberg also put up a 900-word Facebook post in which he apologised for his “mistakes.”","“I started Facebook, and at the end of the day,” he said,” I’m responsible for what happens on our platform. I’m serious about doing what it takes to protect our community”. He added that Facebook has a “responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you”. He also promised to make it harder for apps to “harvest” information of users.","Zuckerberg admitted that governments including Russia’s will get “more sophisticated” in their ways to interfere with elections of other countries, “so we need to make sure that we up our game”. He also admitted that Facebook was unable to tackle undue influence of external factors during the 2016 American elections.","“There’s no doubt that in 2016, there were a number of issues including foreign interference and false news that we did not have as much of a handle on as we feel a responsibility to for our community.”","One of Facebook’s biggest responsibilities, he said, “is to protect data”. To prevent the kind of unauthorised gathering and sharing of data that Cambridge Analytica was involved with, Zuckerberg laid out three steps Facebook will take: “Dramatically reducing” the amount of data that developers have access to; doing a full forensic audit of any app that Facebook uncovers that has any suspicious activity; blocking access to apps that a user hasn’t used for three months.","He said, it is “really important that people know what apps they’ve authorised”.","Zuckerberg said in his post that the company will alert every user whose data may have been affected in the scandal involving Cambridge Analytica. The company will go through an “intensive process” reviewing thousands of apps on the platform.","To tackle the issue of false news, another major concern plaguing a number of countries around the world today, Zuckerberg said, Facebook has made some basic policy decisions. “If you’re anywhere close to being a fake news site, you can’t put Facebook ads on your site, right? So then suddenly, it becomes harder for them to make money. If you make it hard enough for them to make money, they just kind of go and do something else.”","Mark Zuckerberg","The Facebook founder told The New York Times that, he could not have anticipated a situation like this when he started the social media platform during his college days. “If you had asked me, when I got started with Facebook, if one of the central things I’d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each others elections, there’s no way I thought that’s what I’d be doing, if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room.”","Cambridge Analtyica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories has partnered with a firm named Ovleno Business Intelligence (OBI) in India.","Before its website was suspended on Wednesday, OBI had mentioned BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (United) among its political clients.

He said that Facebook will give users easier access to tools to manage how their data is being used and shared, and will further restrict developers' access to data to prevent abuse.","“I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform,” he said. “. . . While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn't change what happened in the past. We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward.”","Specifically he said the company will restrict the data that third-party developers can access to names, profile photos and email addresses, and will require developers to sign a contract before being allowed to ask Facebook users for rights to their posts. The company will post a new feature on the top of every Facebook user’s news feed with a list of the apps they have used and an easy way to revoke the app’s access. The latter feature already exists in privacy settings, but Zuckerberg is promising to give it more prominence on the site.","Later Wednesday, Zuckerberg went on a small media tour to elaborate on his views, telling CNN he would consider testifying before Congress about the problems.","“The short answer is, I’m happy to if it’s the right thing to do,” he said. “What we try to do is send the person at Facebook who will have the most knowledge. If that’s me, then I am happy to go.”","He also acknowledged making a mistake in trusting app developers to use Facebook data properly.","“I don’t know about you, but I’m used to when people legally certify that they are going to do something, that they do it. But I think this was clearly a mistake in retrospect,” he said. “We need to make sure we don’t make that mistake ever again.”","Until now, Facebook's top executives have been mum on Cambridge Analytica. Zuckerberg's last Facebook post was from early March, when his sister photographed him baking cookies at home for the Jewish holiday Purim. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, posted on Saturday from her child's school debate.","But the executives' silence seemed to attract more attention to Facebook's woes — especially after neither Zuckerberg nor Sandberg appeared at a company town hall meeting Tuesday. News organizations published articles asking when they would speak. A #DeleteFacebook campaign gained more momentum after Brian Acton, who made millions after Facebook purchased his app WhatsApp in 2014, said he was deleting the social network.","After the Tuesday meeting, employees posted on social media about how demoralized they felt. In an app for anonymously discussing the workplace, Blind, which requires a corporate email address to join, a Facebook employee posted, “Is this how the downfall of Myspace happened?” Another person wrote, “I just keep thinking about my stock going to zero with all of this.” Others asked for advice about whether they should sell their stock and said they would advise recruits against joining the company.","Behind the scenes, Facebook was in damage-control mode. Lobbyists made the rounds on Capitol Hill. Communications executives sent statements to journalists saying workers and executives, including Zuckerberg, were “outraged” about being deceived. Little was said about Facebook's responsibilities except to defend the legality of its actions.","Meanwhile, Facebook users began to comment that there were no articles about Cambridge Analytica on Facebook's trending-news feed, a feature that showcases news stories on the right-hand side of the Facebook website, until late Tuesday afternoon. (Articles about Uber and Amazon.com were on the feed for much of the day, and the Cambridge story had trended several times over the weekend.) And business case studies about the company's efforts to assist political campaigns such as those of Barack Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were no longer indexed on the company's website.","Meanwhile, lawmakers reiterated calls for Zuckerberg to testify. Congress could ultimately choose to subpoena Zuckerberg or others like Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to press them to speak. But lawmakers seemed to signal they aren’t yet ready to issue that threat.","“We haven’t crossed that bridge yet,” said Republican Sen. John Thune, the leader of the Commerce Committee, during an interview Tuesday. His panel recently sent Facebook a list of questions about its dealings with Cambridge Analytica, and staff will question company leaders privately Wednesday. A hearing has not been formally announced.","In his post, Zuckerberg said that steps that the company had taken to restrict developers’ access to data in 2015 would prevent the type of misuse that had taken place. Through an affiliated psychologist named Alexander Kogan, Cambridge Analytica convinced 270,000 users to download an app that they thought was a personality quiz. They then took advantage of Facebook’s lax data permissions at the time to gain data on the friend networks of those 270,000 people — enabled Kogan and Cambridge to access the profiles of millions more.","Though Cambridge and Kogan violated Facebook’s policies by misrepresenting themselves — users were told that data that was taken for political marketing was being used for a personality quiz app — thousands of third party developers benefited from Facebook’s loose rules at the time. The list of developers who siphoned friends’ data includes gaming companies, dating apps, researchers, and even 2012 President Obama’s presidential campaign, as The Washington Post reported on Monday. Developers at the time could access virtual anything of any value that a person’s friends had posted on the social network: her hometown, current city, events and location check-ins; her interests, groups and all the pages she’d liked; her relationship statuses with romantic partners, friends and family; her birthday, activities, work history and political and religious affiliations; and her photos, notes and videos.","In his post, Zuckerberg acknowledged there had been a breach of trust — not only between Cambridge Analytica, the Cambridge psychologist and Facebook, but “between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it,” he said.","Zuckerberg’s apology is only his latest mea culpa. He has apologized for Facebook’s role in helping to sow divisions in U.S. society ahead of the 2016 presidential election. In January, he announced that his annual New Year’s personal challenge, which in other years entailed learning Mandarin or building artificial intelligence in the home, would be to fix Facebook.","Tony Romm and Drew Harwell contributed to this report.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February.","“It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Mr. Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side.","Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew.","The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used.","Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.”","Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.","“The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Mr. Stamos tweeted.","The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data.","“Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.”","Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited.","“Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Mr. Albright said.","Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said.","This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers.","There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations.","On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter.","Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie.","By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports.","In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as “a curious and naïve 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica.","“I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.”","His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data.","Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting.","In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it.","Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said.","In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article.","Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California — called for investigations of the Facebook data leak.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,” said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee.","Correction:","An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Senator Amy Klobuchar on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

It's complicated, so here's a breakdown.","Why are Facebook and Cambridge Analytica in the news?","In a nutshell, because the personal data of 50 million people was pulled from Facebook by a company contracted by Cambridge Analytica and used for ... we're not sure exactly what. (Facebook later said the number may have been even higher: up to 87 million users.) The third-party firm, Global Science Research, used a clicky personality quiz to get people to interact with the app, which then used a loophole to pull all the behind-the-scenes data of that user, and also the same data relating to all their friends -- typically 200-300 other people per user.","Facebook issued a press release Friday, March 9, saying they had banned Cambridge Analytica, Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie from its platform because they had improperly shared and failed to delete that data, but that seems to have been a pre-emptive move. Late that day, The Guardian published a detailed interview with whistleblower Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica staffer, who was involved in building its data operations to scrape user data from Facebook.","The Guardian claims Facebook threatened to sue to keep the story under wraps, while Cambridge Analytica said it was working within the terms and conditions of Facebook's platform, and that the third party was to blame for any breach of trust or privacy.","On Monday, March 12, Channel 4 News, a U.K. outlet, published a video in which they went undercover, posing as a prospective client of Cambridge Analytica, who pitched its election-influencing capacity to Channel 4, complete with bribery stings, social media manipulation and truth-bending propaganda.","Who's the bad guy in all this?","Depends on your point of view. Cambridge Analytica, through a third party contractor, definitely made the most of the tools available to them to mine Facebook for every ounce of data it could reach without breaking the law, and may have used that data beyond the scope of what was permissible.","Global Science Research, that third party, were the ones who crafted the personality quiz for maximum efficacy, and actually did the data extraction.","But the spotlight is certainly on Facebook for permitting that loophole to exist in the first place, for failing to protect its users' personal data, and for not acting, nor being transparent about it when they knew there had been problems. They knew in 2015 -- Friday's statement was their first acknowledgement there was a problem, more than two years later.","Who is Christopher Wylie?","Christopher Wylie is the whistleblower, an early employee of Cambridge Analytica who detailed their data-scraping techniques in a bombshell interview with The Guardian from his experience putting it into practice. Wylie was one of the actors banned from the platform by Facebook, something he says is regrettable.","\"They seem really pissed off,\" Wylie told CBS News on Monday. \"I don't think they've handled it well -- they haven't done anything on this for two years, And now they have banned me.\"","Wylie said that he was seeking to cooperate with Facebook ahead of the article going live. \"We were going to work on this in a cooperative manner -- there's obviously a lot of issues that need to be discussed -- but you know, I didn't set out to crusade against Facebook -- suddenly they issue this press release and ban me.\"","Was this a data breach?","Not in the classic, sense, no, in that the data wasn't stolen in a hack. Nobody broke into somebody's account and pilfered data. But that's what makes it so worrying -- they didn't have to. Facebook, through its app protocols at the time, allowed an organization to rifle through users' accounts willy-nilly and take their personal data without any real informed consent.","Facebook executives earned widespread internet scorn for trying to defend the company on that technicality. Sure, it may be correct to say it wasn't a breach, by dictionary definition, but for more than 50 million end users, the net effect was the same. Their data was taken without their knowledge, potentially to be used against them.","Should I be worried?","That depends on your point of view. Facebook says it's working to ensure that all the data extracted is no longer in circulation,or stored anywhere that could be hacked. But what's more important is to stay informed on what the apps you use do with your data. Facebook profiles its users, their likes and interests in minute detail to help advertisers and other groups -- like political action groups -- reach them and convince them to vote, buy things and take certain actions. If that seems concerning to you, learn about your security settings and consider limiting your use of platforms that allow more access to your information than you're happy with."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The paper calls it Facebook’s biggest data breach to date.","The details come from a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who said he worked with Aleksandr Kogan, a student at Cambridge University, to obtain the data. Kogan created an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that paid users to take a personality test. Participants had to sign in through their Facebook login and agree to let their data be used for academic purposes.","The app went beyond its seemingly stated scope, however, pulling in data from the friends lists of any test-takers. Facebook’s platform policy only allows developers the use of friend data to enhance a user’s personal experience. The app put that data, from more than 50 million profiles in all, to work instead.","All the data mined from the app became a vital piece of the software Cambridge Analytica used to profile United States voters and serve them with personalized ads ahead of the 2016 election. The U.K. firm has been credited in the past for playing a key role in Donald Trump’s ascent to the White House.","“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie said.","According to The Observer, Facebook “took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals” after learning of the “unprecedented” data harvesting in late 2015. It’s not clear why more drastic steps weren’t taken back then, though yesterday’s action is easier to decode.","Facebook’s Friday suspension of Cambridge Analytica from the platform came four days after The Observer asked the social media company for comment on the whistleblower’s story. Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, was also suspended while the investigation plays out.","Wylie provided The Observer with a dossier of evidence illustrating Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of the data, including emails, invoices, contracts, and bank transfers that point to the scope of the breach. Also in the dossier is an August 2016 letter from Facebook lawyers instructing Wylie to destroy any data collected by Global Science Research, Kogan’s front company.","The letter arrived just a few days before Stephen K. Bannon, a part owner of Cambridge Analytica and former vice president of the company’s board, signed on as Trump’s campaign manager.","Facebook takes the position that data harvested by GSR and Cambridge Analytica doesn’t qualify as a breach. In a statement given to The Observer, the social media company claims Kogan’s app “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” as the info was passed along to third parties.","The company also said Kogan’s app was removed in 2015, and anyone with access to the data had to certify that it had been destroyed. That timing doesn’t line up with Wylie’s August 2016 letter, however.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.

The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Cambridge Analytica was looking for people who were American Facebook users. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz app on Facebook called thisisyourdigitallife.","About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app “scraped” information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends’ profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica.","A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn’t installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.","This weekend, after this was all exposed by The New York Times and The Observer of London, Facebook hastily made a public announcement that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica (well over a year after the election) and vehemently denied that this was a “data breach.” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false.” He contended that Facebook users “knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” He also said that “everyone involved gave their consent.”","Mr. Grewal is right: This wasn’t a breach in the technical sense. It is something even more troubling: an all-too-natural consequence of Facebook’s business model, which involves having people go to the site for social interaction, only to be quietly subjected to an enormous level of surveillance. The results of that surveillance are used to fuel a sophisticated and opaque system for narrowly targeting advertisements and other wares to Facebook’s users.","Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook’s true customers, whom it works hard to please.","Facebook doesn’t just record every click and “like” on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases “external” data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge “offline” data — things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store — with its vast online databases.","Facebook even creates “shadow profiles” of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data. This is an involuntary dossier from which you cannot opt out in the United States.","Despite Facebook’s claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her “consent” — at least not in any meaningful sense of the word. It is true that if you found and read all the fine print on the site, you might have noticed that in 2014, your Facebook friends had the right to turn over all your data through such apps. (Facebook has since turned off this feature.) If you had managed to make your way through a bewildering array of options, you might have even discovered how to turn the feature off.","This wasn’t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.","Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person’s personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook “likes” — and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day?","Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual — especially since it is practically irrevocable.","What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time.","The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company’s operations in the 2016 presidential election.","If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn’t have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn’t free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone’s data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance.","Should we all just leave Facebook? That may sound attractive but it is not a viable solution. In many countries, Facebook and its products simply are the internet. Some employers and landlords demand to see Facebook profiles, and there are increasingly vast swaths of public and civic life — from volunteer groups to political campaigns to marches and protests — that are accessible or organized only via Facebook.","The problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests?","A business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability.","Zeynep Tufekci (@zeynep) is an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, the author of “Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest” and a contributing opinion writer."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

However Cambridge Analytica paid for it at once.”","Cambridge Analytica seemed to lay the blame on Kogan and his corporate World Science Analysis (GSR), which isn’t related to Cambridge College.","“This corporate, World Science Analysis (GSR), was once contractually dedicated by means of us to just download information in keeping with the United Kingdom Knowledge Coverage Act and to hunt the knowledgeable consent of each and every respondent,” Cambridge Analytica mentioned in a remark issued Saturday.","“When it due to this fact was transparent that the knowledge had now not been bought by means of GSR in step with Fb’s phrases of provider, Cambridge Analytica deleted all information won from GSR,” the remark added.","In keeping with ITN Channel four Information, Kogan mentioned he held the proper to make use of the knowledge for business functions and did not anything unsuitable.","In the meantime, the Trump marketing campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $five million to lend a hand goal electorate.

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Cambridge Analytica obtained the data of an estimated 50 million users in 2014 and 2015 under false pretences, breaking Facebook’s rules. Mr Zuckerberg said that the world’s biggest social network has taken steps to ensure data on millions of its users does not get into the wrong hands.","But Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a privacy expert and co-founder of PersonalData.IO, said he suspects the data has already proliferated far beyond Cambridge Analytica’s reach. “It is the whole nature of this ecosystem,” Mr Dehaye said. “This data travels. And once it has spread there is no way to get it back.”","Mr Zuckerberg added that Facebook will investigate and audit thousands of third-party developers. Third-party apps could access data on Facebook users and their friends until 2015, when Facebook changed its rules. Experts question whether the network’s push to investigate and audit thousands of third-party developers will merit any true results. Mr Dehaye questioned how Facebook would define which apps merit investigation and what would constitute “suspicious activity”.","Facebook said that it conducts manual and automated checks to verify developers comply with its policies. It also plans to expand its bug bounty programme to report misuse of data.","Mr Zuckerberg said in interviews that the company is investigating reports that independent researchers and dark web data brokers are trading user data grabbed by the firm Cambridge Analytica.","Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland professor who specialises in algorithms and tech ethics, called this “the runaway data problem” and said there is no way to return the genie to the bottle when it comes to securing data that’s already been released. Location and demographic information, like the data taken from Facebook, can often be used to tie someone to other data points where the identity was previously unclear.","“The larger data sets you get about individuals, the easier it is to use those to reidentify them in data sets where they think they’re anonymous,” professor Pasquale said. “With a relatively small amount of data points, you can infer an incredible amount of very personal information about people.”","Facebook does not know whether other companies have shared or mishandled user data and a forensic audit is ongoing, Mr Zuckerberg told Wired magazine. Asked by Wired how confident he was that Facebook data had not gotten into the hands of Russian operatives or other groups, Mr Zuckerberg said, “I can’t really say that. I hope that we will know that more certainly after we do an audit.”","For many of Facebook’s prime growth years, the company gave outside developers access to virtually everything that a user who authorised an app or her friends, had posted on the social network: her home town, current city, events and location check-ins; her interests, groups and all the pages she’d liked; her relationship statuses with romantic partners, friends and family; her birthday, activities, work history and political and religious affiliations and her photos, notes and videos.","Facebook changed its rules in 2015 amid concerns over how the data was being used. But for years, other developers had the power to construct the same kinds of massive micro-targeted databases that had helped make Facebook so prominent. It’s unclear how many other services used that power or what they have done with the data pulled.","Mr Zuckerberg said the company will “investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information” before the rule change, a number he said would likely be in the thousands. The company, he added, “will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity” and said the company would likely need to hire more workers to complete the audits. “We want to make sure that there aren’t other Cambridge Analyticas out there,” he told Wired.","The data shared with Cambridge Analytica was taken via a personality quiz, called ThisIsYourDigitalLife, that was initially approved by Facebook for research purposes.","World news in pictures","World news in pictures","1/50 18 September 2018","South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wave during a car parade in Pyongyang, North Korea,","Reuters","2/50 17 September 2018","Australia has launched a nationwide investigation into needles being hidden in strawberries.

The data taken by the researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan, who provided it to Cambridge Analytica, “wasn’t watermarked in anyway,” Mr Zuckerberg told Wired. “And if he passed along data to Cambridge Analytica that was some kind of derivative data based on personality scores or something, we wouldn’t have known that or ever seen that data.”","In the same year that Facebook severed ties with him, Dr Kogan also started his own San Francisco-based survey data firm, Philometrics, raising questions about whether he took the Facebook data with him and used for commercial purposes. (Dr Kogan did not reply to repeated requests for comment).","Apps and start-ups that grabbed user data over a number of years, Mr Dehaye said, often hand over their data if they’re acquired by another company or sell their data sets if they close or liquidate.","Facebook opened the door to developers in 2007 in hopes of expanding Facebook’s reach across the web by making it easier for other sites to connect with the sprawling connective maps Facebook uses to link people by relationships and tastes, known as its “social graph” and “interest graph”.","Marketing firms have spent tens of millions of dollars to learn similar information – including compiling consumer surveys and purchasing massive consumer files from data brokers such as Experian and Acxiom – all of which came from different sources and had varying ages, precision and usefulness. Facebook’s wealth of data, on the other hand, was packed with detailed information volunteered by users themselves and offered completely free until the rule change took effect in 2015.","Facebook, Mr Zuckerberg said, will now restrict the data that third-party developers can access to names, profile photos and email addresses and will require developers to sign a contract before being allowed to ask users for rights to their posts.","Facebook said it will ban developers who misuse its data.","The sheer size of the data pulled from Facebook, experts say, is powerful on its own – and could prove valuable for marketers, political campaigns or other groups seeking to target users en masse.","“Getting good data on 50 million people from a relatively neutral, nonpartisan source that is diversely spread and not just clustered in one tiny segment of the social graph – that’s a big deal,” said Matthew Hindman, a George Washington University associate professor who researches online campaigning and internet politics. “If you can see that many people’s activity on Facebook, you can guess pretty accurately what their partisanship might be, no matter how good your model is.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

Then they used this data to help the Trump and Brexit campaigns psychologically manipulate voters through targeted ads. The result was Vote Leave ‘won’ the UK’s Brexit referendum and Trump was elected president in the US.","Unfortunately, almost everything in the above summary is false or misleading.","First, There was no hack.","The data collected was scraped from Facebook user profiles, after users granted permission for a third party app to access their data. You know those little confirmation windows that pop up when someone wants to play Candy Crush or use Facebook to log in, rather than make a new password, for a random site? Yeah those.","A Cambridge academic called Aleksandr Kogan — NOT Cambridge Analytica and NOT the whistleblower Christopher Wylie — made a ‘Test Your Personality’ app, helped to promote it by paying people $2–4 to install it on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site, and used the permissions granted to harvest profile data. 270,000 users installed the app, so you might expect that 270,000 profiles were collected but the app actually collected data from 50 million profiles.","50 million?!?","Yes. You see back in the heady days of 2014, Facebook had a feature called ‘friends permission’ that allowed developers to access the profiles of not only the person who installed their app but all their friends too. The only way to prevent this from happening was to have toggled a privacy setting, which few Facebook users even knew existed (here is a blog from 2012 explaining how to do so). The friends permission feature is how Kogan multiplied 270,000 permissions into 50 million profiles worth of data.","That Facebook users were having their data shared by their friends without their knowledge or permission was a serious concern that many privacy advocates noted at the time. So in 2015, facing growing criticism and pressure, Facebook removed the feature citing a desire to give their users “more control”. This decision caused consternation amongst developers as the ability to access friends profiles was extremely popular (see the comments under this 2014 post from Facebook announcing the changes). Sandy Parakilas, an ex-Facebook manager, reported to Bloomberg that “tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers” were making use of the feature before it was discontinued.","To review, there are two key points to remember at this point:","None of what I just described involves ‘hacking’ Facebook or exploiting a bug. Instead, it all revolves around the use of a feature that Facebook provided to all developers and (at least) tens of thousands took advantage of.","The data collected was not internal Facebook data. It was data that developers (s̵c̵r̵a̵p̵e̵d̵ ) accessed* from the profiles of people who downloaded their apps (and their friends). Facebook has a lot more data on users than is publically available and it has it for everyone who uses their platform. No one but Facebook has access to that data. This is a point that almost all the journalists involved seem unable to grasp, instead they repeatedly equate ‘Facebook’s internal data’ to ‘data (s̵c̵r̵a̵p̵e̵d̵ )accessed from Facebook profiles using a third party app’. But these are VERY different things.(*changed term as per convincing suggestion provided in the responses.)","The importance of this second point becomes apparent when you read exchanges like this one:","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.","This exchange is being reported as evidence that Facebook lied to politicians about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. But when you understand the difference between Facebook’s internal data and data collected on Facebook by outside developers it is clear that what Facebook’s policy director is saying is very likely true.","So where does Cambridge Analytica come in to the story?","Well, they paid Kogan to collect those 50 million profiles. Whose idea that was originally is currently a matter of ‘he said, she said’. Kogan says Cambridge Analytica approached him and Cambridge Analytica says Kogan came to them. Whatever the case may be, this is the part of the story where there was an actual breach; not of Facebook’s internal data but of Facebook’s data sharing policies. Developers were permitted to collect all the user data they wanted from their apps, but what they were not allowed to do — even back in 2014 — was take that data and sell it to a third party.","The fact that there were (at minimum) tens of thousands of developers with access to such information meant that it was inevitable that data harvested on Facebook was being sold, or otherwise provided, to a wide array of third parties. Again, the disgruntled ex Facebook manager confirmed as much:","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on. Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers.","So given how prevalent Facebook data harvesting was and that there are many developers with more than 270,000 users to harvest from, why is Cambridge Analytica receiving so much media attention?","The answer to this seems to primarily be how journalists, particularly Carole Cadwalladr at the Observer, have framed the story. The majority of coverage has pushed two angles. First, that a whistleblower from Cambridge Analytica revealed ‘a major breach’ of Facebook’s data, an issue covered above, and second, that this ‘breach’ was linked to the success of Trump’s presidential campaign.","Chris Wylie the mastermind who ‘hacked’ Facebook…","This second angle is as dubious as the first and relies heavily on bombastic claims made by Chris Wylie—the pink haired ex-Cambridge Analytica employee pictured above. Carole Cadwalladr, who spent years on the story, has explained in various interviews that she approached the story not as an investigative journalist but as a features writer. This meant that she focused on delving into ‘the human side of the story’, or put another way- Chris Wylie. There are pros and cons to such an approach but the biggest drawback is how invested and reliant it made her and subsequent coverage in accepting Wylie’s narrative, which just so happens to paint him as a young mastermind at the center of global political conspiracies.","Cadwalladr fully endorses Wylie’s presentation and fawningly describes him as: “clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling” … “impossibly young” … “His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible” … “Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time” … “when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something — his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead — it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold” … “his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great BritishBake Off.”","Wow… what a guy.","Cadwalladr’s person-focused approach might make for more accessible articles but it also helps to obscure the relevant technical details in favour of providing sensationalist quotes and personal anecdotes from Wylie and his friends and coworkers. Presenting these kinds of details could be insightful, if they were subjected to sufficient critical examination but this rarely occurs. Cadwalladr, instead, seems to have entirely bought into Wylie’s narrative: “by the time I met him in person, I’d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time.”","So let’s address the oversight and take a bit more of a critical look at what Wylie’s narrative claims:","That Cambridge Analytica claims to be able to provide effective tools for psychological targeting and manipulation… Certainly true.","That Chris Wylie, himself, was involved with some shady business and views himself as partly responsible… Sure.","That the self-promotional claims of Cambridge Analytica actually equate to how effective the services they provide are… Hmmmm.","This last point is the most important and yet it is also the one lacking almost any supporting evidence.","The temptation might be to point to Trump’s surprising victory but there are a lot of confounding factors there. Trump won, yes. But he won against the most unpopular Democratic candidate in modern history, who was vying for a third Democratic term (something which had not been achieved since the 1940s). Furthermore, he won by a very slim margin and actually lost the popular vote.","Could all that just be evidence of how precise Cambridge Analytica’s psychological targeting was? Maybe, but we start to run into the perils of dealing with an unfalsifiable hypothesis. A better approach would be to look at Cambridge Analytica’s relative record of success and failure. Unfortunately, we do not have access to their full client list but we do know that when they first rose to prominence they were working for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. That’s right, Ted Cruz — the Republican senator who was crushed by Trump in the Republican primaries, despite having the power of Cambridge Analytica at his command. I am not the first to notice this apparent contradiction, Martin Robbins made the same point on Little Atoms last year:","So the story of the Republican primaries is actually that Cambridge Analytica’s flashy data science team got beaten by a dude with a thousand-dollar website. To turn that into this breathtaking story of an unbeatable voodoo-science outfit, powering Trump inexorably to victory, is quite a stretch. Who else have they even worked for? Without a list of clients it’s very easy to cherry-pick the winners.","The techniques that Cambridge Analytica purport to use involve using social network data to build algorithms that can accurately predict what kind of messages will be effective given an individual’s personality and psychology. This is what the stories mean when they talk about using psychographics to micro-target voters. But a lot of the claims being made about the effectiveness of such techniques is widely exaggerated. Kogan — the Cambridge academic at the heart of the controversy — has made similar arguments. He claims that he is being scapegoated and argues that the personality profiles he gathered turned out to not be particularly useful for making the predictions needed for micro-targeting:","In fact, from our subsequent research on the topic,” he wrote, “we found out that the predictions we gave SCL were 6 times more likely to get all 5 of a person’s personality traits wrong as it was to get them all correct. In short, even if the data was used by a campaign for micro-targeting, it could realistically only hurt their efforts.","Kogan is hardly an impartial source but his claim accords with various studies that have shown less than stellar results for nefarious social media manipulation. Take, for instance, the controversial Facebook ‘mind control’ study, which I’ve heard several journalists reference in recent days. What always seems to be missing from reporting on this study is just how underwhelming it was.","Facebook ran an experiment on almost 689,000 users in which it tweaked the algorithm running their news feed to display slightly more or slightly less status updates from friends that contained positive or negative words. As any researcher knows, with such a large sample you are guaranteed to find statistically significant differences between groups. A more important criteria with such massive groups is how large the effect observed was. In the Facebook study this equated to a truly terrifying difference: those who saw less negative updates used around 0.05 more positive words out of every 100 words in their status updates, whereas those who saw less positive updates used around 1 less positive word per 100 in their status updates. That’s right Facebook might have been able to manipulate people to use around 1 less positive word for every 100 words in their updates. It would be wrong to paint this as Facebook being powerless, bigger interventions would have bigger effects, but it is important to keep things in perspective.","Note the starting point of the y-axis. There is a reason it isn’t 0.","The real story then is not that Kogan, Wylie, and Cambridge Analytica developed some incredibly high tech ‘hack’ of Facebook. It is that, aside from Kogan’s data selling, they used methods that were common place and permitted by Facebook prior to 2015. Cambridge Analytica has since the story broke been outed as a rather obnoxious, unethical company- at least in how it promotes itself to potential clients. But the majority of what is being reported in the media about its manipulative power is just an uncritical regurgitation of Cambridge Analytica (and Chris Wylie’s) self-promotional claims. The problem is that there is little evidence that the company can do what it claims and plenty of evidence that it is not as effective as it likes to pretend; see the fact that Ted Cruz is not currently president.","No one is totally immune to marketing or political messaging but there is little evidence that Cambridge Analytica is better than other similar PR or political canvassing companies at targeting voters. Political targeting and disinformation campaigns, including those promoted by Russia, certainly had an impact on recent elections but were they the critical factor? Did they have a bigger impact than Comey announcing he was ‘reopening’ the Hillary email investigation the week before the US election? Or Brexiteers claiming that £250 million was being stolen from the NHS by the EU every week? Colour me skeptical.","To be crystal clear, I’m not arguing that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan were innocent. At the very least, it is clear they were doing things that were contrary to Facebook’s data sharing policies.

Some of those services may have leveraged your data to undermine the very foundations of American democracy. Hard to say!","New reports from the Guardianand New York Timesreveal how a Trump-aligned data-gathering service called Cambridge Analytica \"exploited\" information from millions of people in the lead-up to the 2016 election. It was pretty simple: The firm created a personality test app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" and people opted in to take it, granting the app permission to scrape their personal data in the process. It also harvested their friends' data.","Facebook has a lot to answer for, but in the meantime, you might be curious to see if you've given sketchy apps access to your data over the years. There's a very good chance you have: I found today that 170 apps were able to access some level of my personal Facebook data. Some of them definitely seem off.","Though Facebook is fairly transparent about what kind of data apps are able to access when you connect them to your profile, granting permission on an indefinite basis only requires a couple of taps. And until now, users might reasonably expect that simple personality quizzes or one-off games weren't being used to create a complex network for the purposes of voter manipulation.","In other words, it's a good time to check in.","Here's how to check your app settings on Facebook:","- On desktop, click the downward facing arrow in the upper-right side of your News Feed. Then, click \"Settings.\"","- From there, tap \"Apps\" in the left-hand sidebar.","- On mobile, tap the icon showing three stacked lines. The icon is on top of your screen if you're using the Android app, and it's on the bottom if you're on iOS.","- Then, tap \"Settings.\" You may need to scroll down a bit to find it. Tap \"Account Settings,\" then scroll down and tap \"Apps.\"","- Finally, tap \"Logged in with Facebook\" to see the services accessing your account.","Once you're here, you'll be able to see all of the apps you've logged into with Facebook. A lot of them, like Airbnb or Amazon, are probably fine! But others should give you pause. For example, this embarrassing Pokemon personality quiz I took years ago:","It has access to a ton of my data, including my relationship status, friend list, and birthday. Needless to say, I clicked \"Remove App\" to get rid of it.","I don't remember taking this quiz—or, tragically, which Pokemon I am—though Facebook would reasonably say I opted into it and am therefore responsible for any data I hand over to it. But I signed up for it a long time ago, likely when I was intoxicated, and who knows what it's taken from me since then.","So: Take as much responsibility for yourself and your data as you can, because it impacts your friends, too. Dig through your connected apps. Remove some of them if you must. And hey, maybe think about deleting Facebook all together.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn’t authorized to have that information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded the app and shared their personal details with it, Facebook said.","Years ago, Facebook says, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn’t authorized to have that information.

(Matt Rourke / The Associated Press file photo)","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information that it received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports “several days ago” that not all the data was deleted.","While it investigates the matter, Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; the academic who created the app in question, a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received the user data from the app.","Exactly why the handling of this data warranted both suspension and Facebook’s unusual public explanation of the move wasn’t clear. The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the “public prominence” of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an “unacceptable violation of trust” and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties “responsible and accountable for any unlawful behaviour.”","In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson denied any wrongdoing. He said the parent company’s SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake “a large scale research project in the U.S.,” but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan’s company. For the “avoidance of doubt,” the spokesman said, none of Kogan’s data was used in Cambridge Analytica’s 2016 election work.","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","Britain’s information commissioner said Saturday it is investigating whether Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used,” after the social network suspended Cambridge Analytica.","Article Continued Below","The British probe is part of a broader inquiry into how political parties, data companies and social media platforms use personal information to target voters during political campaigns, including Britain’s 2016 Brexit referendum on EU membership.","Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said Saturday it’s important “the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy.”","She said “any criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously.”","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz and the Trump general-election campaign .","The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica’s role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","But the company has also surfaced a few times during the probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. For instance, Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is now co-operating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation after pleading guilty to a felony charge, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the Hillary Clinton campaign. Nix said Assange said no. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.

Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","Originally published on March 16, 2018:We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook. Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.","We Maintain Strict Standards and Policies","Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","Breaking the Rules Leads to Suspension","Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.","We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.","How Things Have Changed","We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers. Now all apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process, which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.","In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list. This is just one of the many ways we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can manage or revoke those permissions at any time.","On an ongoing basis, we also do a variety of manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with our policies and a positive experience for users. These include steps such as random audits of existing apps along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing apps.","We enforce our policies in a variety of ways — from working with developers to fix the problem, to suspending developers from our platform, to pursuing litigation."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged.","Acxiom said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March. The company currently expects revenue in the range of $910 million to $915 million in the 2018 fiscal year.","Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said.","Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users’ anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation.","Facebook’s shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook’s lifeblood, and lead to tougher regulation.","Figurines are seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic","SCRUTINY FROM LAWMAKERS","Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers’ access to user information.","There is a new Facebook page - called Access Your Information - where users can see what they have shared and manage it.","“The biggest difference is ease of access in settings, which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg’s promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users,” Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.","It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers.","They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May. It requires companies to give people a “right to portability” - to take their data with them - and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law.","Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users’ data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.","He plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators.","Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.

It's a terribly creepy social media platform that we hungrily devoured like a wet taco after a ten-kilometer run. The Cambridge Analytica scandal has once again opened our eyes to the monster in the corner we've been trying so hard not to acknowledge. Facebook has left us with only a few options on how to proceed with the social giant.","The thing is, it's not just Facebook. Everything you do online is somehow tracked and seen and registered and there are databases all over the world filled to the brim with the minutia of your online life.\nGoogle tracks your every movement online when logged in, Snapchat is working on a data collection API, and thousands of other companies are probably spying on you. The\nEquifax breach was massive and keeps getting worse. But you don't use Equifax every day, you use Facebook every day. So it's only natural that your ire is focused on Mark and company.","Facebook has made its privacy tools apparently \"easier to find\" which speaks to the blatant and willful ignorance of most users. It's not a complex platform. Your privacy settings are right there under settings. But let's assume for a moment that privacy settings were difficult to find. Then let's throw that argument out the window. Hell, Zuckerberg promised easier, better privacy controls back in 2010. So nothing has really changed, just the PR machine and our inability to really care about something for more than a day.","Silicon Valley is increasingly proving that just because you can do something doesn't mean you should, especially when you aren't willing to consider every single application of your tech besides the intended one. The innovation seems to appear after the technology is abused, at least in our definition of abuse.","Facebook presents us with an interesting conundrum, based on how embedded it is in our daily lives. We really only have three options because it's pretty clear that we are simply nothing more to Facebook than data points up for grabs.","Option 1: Complete and total apathy","Does it really matter that the data you somehow considered to be private is out there in the world? Probably not. Is it going to really affect your life in any substantial manner? Probably not. Who do you really think you are? We are all ants, scuttling around the hill, going out into the world every day on the hunt for food, bringing that food home and feeding ourselves and our families. None of it really matters. We're all just riding a slow roller coaster to death. May as well post some memes and see if your third cousin Ronnie made bail this week. It doesn't matter.","Option 2: Go all in","While Facebook has postponed the release of its speaker, when that thing comes out — buy it. Put it next to your Amazon Echo Look. Get excited for the future Facebook brain interface. Control everything with your IFTTT apps and dance for your Nest security camera. Embrace the lack of true privacy and show them everything. Put it all out there and you've got nothing to lose. Privacy is an illusion, the curtain has been pulled back so drown them in personal data and never worry about privacy again.","Option 3: Escape","Playboy is quitting Facebook, the latest big brand to do so after Elon Musk pulled the SpaceX Facebook pages, then took to Twitter to explain why he doesn't like Facebook. Where does that leave the regular user though? It's easy for a brand to just up and leave Facebook, we already know those brands exist. We don't know that each other exist. I couldn't imagine just cutting and running from the network of contacts I've amassed through social media. Yet, completely going dark remains an option.","Terminate your social accounts, light a candle for the data that you've already released out into the world — there's not much you can do about that. Delete Facebook and the people who really matter will find a way to remain in your lives without it. Or they won't, and then you'll know who actually really matters, not just the people you thought mattered. Then give away all your belongings, drive as far south as the roads will take you, push your car off a cliff and build a shed on the beach to live out your remaining days. Because that's what quitting social media will feel like.","****","Perhaps this is the time for a new social network to rise up out of the troubled privacy-concern riddled ashes of Facebook. That is another conversation for another day. For now, all we can really do is look around in amazement at the world we've signed up for, and the blood we've so willingly spilled in the guise of being hyper-connected to each other. In the end, each other is all we've got, but Facebook has got all of us.","**********\nAuthor Bio: Writing about consumer technology, social media and the deep layers of psychological torture endured by all of it.

Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.","“Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made,” the company said.","The Independent contacted Facebook for a response regarding Wylie’s suspension and the company pointed us back to the previous statement to explain its decision.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix has since been accused of “deliberately misleading” MPs when he appeared in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee to give an account of the company’s activities last month.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament by giving false statements,” chairman Damian Collins said.","Gadgets and tech news in pictures","Gadgets and tech news in pictures","1/43","Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

The latest revelations of a massive user privacy breach at Facebook have raised new questions about whether the company can and should be trusted to responsibly manage the personal data of its more than 2.1 billion users.","#DeleteFacebook began trending last week after reports that Facebook allowed the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly access the personal data of as many as 50 million users. According to admissions by Cambridge Analytica, the data was used to develop psychographic profiles to help political campaigns target voters.","In the aftermath of these revelations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone on a charm offensive, speaking with reporters, apologizing for mishandling user data and promising to do better in the future.","On Sunday, Zuckerberg took out a full-page ad in multiple U.S. newspapers that read, \"We have a responsibility to protect your information.

I promise to do better for you.\"","Some have taken note of the CEO's apology and applauded the company for taking steps to make its data-sharing policies more transparent. Zuckerberg and other executives at Facebook have published notices explaining steps they're taking to crack down on platform abuses as well as their efforts to make privacy settings more user-friendly.","Others have pointed to the fact that Facebook's business model is based on monetizing user data.","\"Facebook says we don't sell your data, but they certainly provide access to it,\" observed Michelle De Mooy, director of the privacy and data project at the Center for Democracy and Technology.","Moreover, Facebook acknowledged that it knew about Cambridge Analytica's questionable contract with Kogan in 2015. At that time, they suspended Kogan and asked him to confirm that he had deleted the user data. According to reports, that user data remained accessible to Cambridge Analytica for years.","\"Facebook has been dragged, seemingly kicking and screaming into being more transparent,\" said Dave Levine, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University. \"Facebook has not done nearly as much as it could, simply by way of explanation to the public about its behaviors, about how your information or posts are curated, about what kind of data it collects and how it shares it.\"","The Cambridge Analytica breach is only the latest example of the company's opacity and delayed response to public outcry. Facebook has been at the center of the fake news controversy and spreading misinformation during the 2016 election. The company has been called before Congress over their role in facilitating Russian election interference and online terrorist recruitment. And the company finally acknowledged and changed their newsfeed policy after being caught suppressing conservative content.","Each scandal has temporarily hurt Facebook, but the latest scandal over violating users' privacy could be the one that tips the scales and imposes real costs and consequences on the social media giant.","\"Ultimately the problem here is one of trust,\" explained Julian Sanchez, privacy and technology fellow at the Cato Institute. If users no longer believe the company is responsibly handling their information or feel they cannot understand the company's policies for sharing their data, Zuckerberg's apologies will be \"too little, too late,\" Sanchez noted.","\"Once that's burned, once people don't have a sense of trust, I don't know if the specific policy changes will help much,\" he continued. \"Even if they really are making genuine improvements, as it appears they are, once that trust is gone, it's hard to get back.\"","In a new poll conducted in the days after the data sharing scandal erupted, Reuters/Ipsos found that the majority of respondents do not trust Facebook to handle their data.","Facebook was deemed the least trustworthy when it came to obeying laws that protect American's personal information when compared to other companies that gather user data like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo.","\"Maybe the poll is new, but the sentiment is not,\" De Mooy explained. The reason, she said, is that social media platforms \"are designed for opacity,\" intentionally making it harder for users to understand and make informed decisions about their data.","Facebook and other companies that rely on selling access to user data have had to walk a thin line between protecting their users' data and monetizing it. Consistently over recent years, polls have shown that even as users sign up and sign away some of the rights to their data, they are wary of how that information is being used.","Periodically, this concern has translated into relatively short-lived calls for people to deactivate their Facebook accounts, but it is not clear that those efforts have caused the company to fundamentally change how it operates.","\"If a few hundred-thousand people delete their Facebook accounts that will have a marginal impact on their bottom line,\" Levine noted. \"However if there is a reputational hit at the trust level, which is what Facebook needs to maintain in order to be a viable business, that cumulatively could create problems.\"","In recent weeks, Facebook has taken a significant hit with the markets valuing the breach of privacy and trust in the tens of billions. Since the story broke earlier this month, Facebook's stock has plunged more than 15 percent in a selling spree that has cost the company over $75 billion in market value.","Facebook could also be facing even more costs as the consumer protection watchdogs at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Monday that they had opened a non-public investigation into Facebook's privacy and data use policies based on the reports about the company's relationship with Cambridge Analytica.","The FTC already brought charges against Facebook in 2011 for what it termed \"deceptive privacy claims.\" At the time, Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC and signed a consent decree which, among other things, required the company to obtain a user's explicit consent before allowing third parties to access their data. Moreover, the agreement required Facebook to inform users if they discovered they were unable to protect their data.","\"Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here,\" former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection Jessica Rich told the Washington Post last week. \"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties.\"","If the FTC finds Facebook in violation of the consent decree, the company could face a $40,000 fine per violation. It is not clear whether that fine would apply to the alleged 50 million users whose data was shared inappropriately with Cambridge Analytica. In a statement to the Post, a Facebook spokesperson said the company rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\"","De Mooy said she is encouraged by the FTC investigation, emphasizing that \"the consent decrees need to be meaningful.\" However, she worries that regulators simply lack the enforcement authority when it comes to protecting consumer data.","In the United States, consumer data is largely governed by contracts and terms of use agreements between the consumer and the company. This approach is vastly different from the European Union, which will be implementing a new regime of privacy protections, the General Data Protection Regulation, beginning in May.","The new privacy regime will directly impact U.S. tech companies that will be required to be more transparent in informing consumers about their sharing practices in order to get consent. Companies that fail to protect user data can also expect to see millions of dollars in fines.","It is yet to be seen whether U.S. lawmakers, who have traditionally taken a lax approach to regulating internet companies, will take steps to strengthen data privacy protections."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

It is in the middle of a big data scandal, where the allegations are that it shared data of over 50 million users with a quiz app, the data which ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica that reportedly used it to micro-target and influence voters in the US election.","Organisations, people and companies across the world are taking a fresh look at their relationship with Facebook. But apparently in India it is business as usual.","At a time when Facebook stands accused of being a platform that is turning democracy and democratic processes like voting into a farce, the Election Commission of India is going to work with Facebook for elections in Karnataka. We should ask why.","The scandal involving Facebook is in news. All of this is serious, so serious that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said sorry and has vowed to fix it. It is so serious, this whole fiasco over Facebook using big data for purposes that seem clear breach of privacy, that regulators and lawmakers across the world are looking into it. British lawmakers want Zuckerberg to testify because they believe Facebook might have been used to influence voting in their country.","The US regulators in the US too seek the same and Zuckerberg reportedly has agreed. The FTC, a regulating agency in the US, is official probing if Facebook violated an earlier privacy agreement it signed with government officials.","Then there is the fallout. Mozilla, a browser, just a few days ago pulled out of Facebook ad network because of the privacy issues. There are thousands of people, who have deleted their Facebook accounts or pages, including people like Farhan Akhtar and companies like Tesla. German bank Commerzbank and audio product company Sonos too has pulled off their ads from Facebook. There is hashtag #DeleteFacebook trending.","So, the question, to repeat, needs to be asked, why the Election Commission of India is going ahead with its plans to work with Facebook for an election at a time when Facebook stands accused of being careless about its platform and data that has been used to unethically (and probably illegally) influence voting?","This is not to say that Facebook can’t be a force for good. The die-hard optimists can still believe that Facebook, or for that matter any social media site, could do wonders for democracy. May be Election Commission of India believes it too, even if Facebook itself is no longer sure.","Just a few months ago, the company told the world that it couldn’t guarantee that it was always good for democracies. “I wish I could guarantee that the positives are destined to outweigh the negatives, but I can’t,” Samidh Chakrabarti, a Facebook product manager, wrote on company’s official page.","This means, let’s ask the big question again: Why is the Election Commission of India still going to work with Facebook for arguably one of the most important elections this year?","The standard practice in these cases, in instances when a company or an organisation is in the middle of something as serious as what Facebook has found itself in, is to hit pause. It’s possible that Facebook had no role to play in either the Russian meddling in US elections, or in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but the right course of action would be to pause all activities until there is a proper investigation and a proper conclusion. This is something agencies and the organisations that take accountability and ethics seriously do.","The Election Commission of India is not just a private entity. Or a small organisation. Any election in India is not some random voting process or a survey. It involves millions and millions of people.","India is the world’s biggest democracy and at a time when the rest of the world is looking at how people have used Facebook data and platform to undermine the democratic processes, Indian regulators cannot be - or rather should not be - seen working with the firm.","In fact, ideally the Election Commission of India should be reviewing how Facebook is used by organisations and people in India for election purposes. We already have the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie saying that the data analysis firm is active in Indian elections. That is a serious claim. That is something the Election Commission should be probing and only when it conclusively sees that Facebook is a force for good for democracy it should work with the social media giant.","The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of DailyO.in or the India Today Group.

Cue lots of commentary about what it is they do, much of which has leapt breathlessly to the obscure details.","If you judged by the news cycle alone, you would assume that Cambridge Analytica had invented some entirely new way of marketing, that tapped straight into our deepest fears and insecurities, and that Facebook had booted them off in horror at this gross and intrusive innovation into our inmost psyches.","Fortunately, the shock-and-awe coverage misses the point. Cambridge Analytica’s approach is not entirely unique, and they have been excluded from Facebook because of how they did it, which was a breach of the platform’s terms, not for what they did.","I know this, because my team do something similar. When we founded Wavemaker at the start of 2018, we brought our audience research specialists and our programmatic marketing experts into one team (known as TAPP), because we recognised that understanding people and targeting media towards them are two sides of the same coin. Modern media needs to move people as individuals or as small groups, not just en masse – and that means getting closer to their individual motivations, and finding ways to target advertising to specific people with specific mindsets, not just broad demographics. We call this precision marketing (and judging from Marc Pritchard’s comments at ISBA a few weeks ago, we’re not alone).","There are two parts to precision marketing. The first is good old-fashioned attitudinal or psychographic segmentation. This has always been one of the most useful items in any brand marketer’s toolbox. By understanding buyers based on their reasons for buying – their attitudes, values, needs and worldviews – you can get to a far richer understanding and build stronger brands, products, propositions and communications.","In media, though, we’ve always tended to sneer a bit at psychographic segmentation) remind me, are we trying to reach Struggling Jugglers or Juggling Strugglers?) but that’s largely because our ways of targeting media had no overlap with these inner-life profiles beloved of consumer insight teams. This is changing, and fast, with the arrival of the second element that makes precision marketing a possibility: very large data sets of millions or billions of individual profiles, which can be connected to addressable media.","Within our TAPP team, we create psychographic and purchasing-behaviour segments using established research methods, and match these into large, privacy-compliant customer pools, especially Group M’s [m]Platform, to identify dozens or hundreds of individual digital behaviours that predict individual mindsets, brand attitudes, or needs. We use these to build specific media targets (online and off) so we reach the right people with the most interesting, relevant advertising. There’s very little voodoo about any of this – it just needs proper researchers, data scientists and digital experts sitting together to make it happen.","Cambridge Analytica’s method of doing this was not revolutionary – beside the alleged non-compliance of their data, they were matching psychographic segments to Facebook likes, which is barely scratching the surface of predictive analytics. But the approach – audience research meets big data meets precision media – is starting to change how we use media to move people.","When we understand people better, we can be more interesting and useful. Nor should any of this be done in secret – research ethics, data ethics and media ethics need to be part of an open discussion about the role that advertisers, the media, and even politicians play in our society."],"isopubdate":""}

Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged.","Acxiom said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March.","The company currently expects revenue in the range of $910 million to $915 million in the 2018 fiscal year.","However, for the 2019 fiscal year, Acxiom expects total revenue and profitability to be negatively impacted by as much as $25 million.","Facebook declined to comment on how the change could affect its ad revenue.","Advertisers would still be able to use third-party data services to measure how well their ads performed by examining purchasing data, Facebook said.","Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said.","Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users' anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation.","Facebook's shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.","The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook's lifeblood, and lead to tougher regulation.","SCRUTINY FROM LAWMAKERS","Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers' access to user information.","There is a new Facebook page - called Access Your Information - where users can see what they have shared and manage it.","\"The biggest difference is ease of access in settings, which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg's promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users,\" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.","It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers.","They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May. It requires companies to give people a \"right to portability\" - to take their data with them - and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law.","Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users' data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.","He plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators.","Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.

Still, it has some genuine usefulness. And while the single best way to keep your privacy safe on Facebook is to delete your account, taking these simple steps in the settings is the next best thing.","Remember, it's not just friends of friends you need to think about hiding from; it's an army of advertisers looking to target you not just on Facebook itself, but around the web, using Facebook's ad platform. In the video above and the post below, we'll show you how to deal with both.","Fine-Tuning Friends","Limiting who can see which of your posts is an easy first step. On a desktop, go to the little dropdown arrow in the upper-right corner, and click Settings. From there, click on Privacy on the left-hand side. This is where the magic happens.","Under Who can see my stuff, click on Who can see your future posts to manage your defaults. You can make public to anyone at all, limited to your friends, or exclude specific friends. You can quarantine your posts by geography, or by current or previous employers or schools, or by groups. Just remember that the next time you change it, the new group becomes the default. So double check every time you post.","This section has other important privacy tools you can fiddle with, including who can look you up with your email address or phone number. We'd recommend not listing either in the first place, but if you do, keep the circle as small as possible. (If you do have to share one or the other with Facebook for account purposes, you can hide them by going to your profile page, clicking Contact and Basic Info, then Edit when you mouse over the email field. From there, click on the downward arrow with two silhouettes to customize who can see it, including no one but you.)","But pay special attention to the option to (deep breath) Limit the audience for posts you’ve shared with friends of friends or public? If you ever had a public account, taking it private wasn't retroactive. If you want to hide those previously viewable posts, lock this setting down.","Over on Timeline and Tagging you can control over what shows up on your own Facebook timeline. Basically, you can’t stop your friends from tagging you (sorry!), but you can stop those embarrassing photos from popping up on your page. At the very least, you should go to Review posts you’re tagged in before the post appears on your timeline, and enable that so that you can screen any tags before they land on your page.","To test out your changes, go to Review what other people see on your timeline. You can even see how specific people view your page, like your boss or your ex or complete strangers. It also never hurts to take stock of you present yourself to the world. (Looking at you, people who haven't updated your cover photo since the Obama administration.)","That should about cover your friends. Now onto advertisers, which are like friends, except they never leave you alone, even if you ask nicely.","Ad It Up","In that same Settings panel, head down to Ads. As you probably realized, Facebook knows what you do pretty much everywhere online. So does Google, so do dozens of ad networks you’ve never heard of. You're being tracked pretty much all the time, by everyone, thanks to this here internet.","You can still limit how Facebook uses that information, though. Tired of that lawnmower you looked at following you to Facebook? Turn off Ads based on my use of websites and apps. Saying no to Ads on apps and websites off the Facebook companies does the same, except for all the sites Facebook serves ads to around the web. Which is most of them.","Lastly, for some fun insight into how advertisers think of you, click on Your Interests. There you’ll find all the categories Facebook uses to tailor ads for you. You can remove any you don’t like, and marvel at the ones that don’t make any sense. This won't make the ads go away, but it'll at least you can banish all those off-brand kitchen gadgets from your News Feed.","And you’re good! Or at least, as good as can be expected.

Around 270,000 people agreed to take the test, but Facebook's terms of service and API at the time allowed the firm to also collect the data of the participants' friends - or the information of more than 50 million people.","The company's shares closed down nearly 7.0 percent on Monday, wiping nearly US$40 billion off its market value following the revelation.","Cambridge Analytica said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","“The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley’s use of data.","The scrutiny presents a fresh threat to Facebook’s reputation, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway US voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.","\"We do have some concerns,” said Ron Bates, portfolio manager on the US$131 million 1919 Socially Responsive Balanced Fund, a Facebook shareholder.","“The big issue of the day around customer incidents and data is something that has been discussed among ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) investors for some time and has been a concern.”","Bates said he was encouraged by the fact that the company has acknowledged the privacy issues and was responding, and thinks it remains an appropriate investment for now.","Facebook on Monday said it had hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to carry out a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica, and the company had agreed to comply and give the forensics firm complete access to their servers and systems.","“What would be a deal-breaker for us would be if we saw this recurring and we saw significant risk to the consumer around privacy,” Bates said.","New York City comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees US$193 billion in city pension fund assets, on Monday said that “as investors in Facebook, we’re closely following what are very alarming reports\".","Sustainalytics BV, a widely used research service that rates companies on their ESG performance for investors, said it was reviewing its Facebook rating, which is currently “average.”","“We’re definitely taking a look at it to see if there should be some change,” said Matthew Barg, research manager at Sustainalytics.","“Their business model is so closely tied to having access to consumer data and building off that access. You want to see that they understand that and care about that.”","Wall Street investors, including ESG funds, have ridden the tech sector to record highs in recent months, betting on further outsized returns from stocks including Facebook, Apple and Google parent Alphabet.","Jennifer Sireklove, director of responsible investing at Parametric, a money manager with US$200 billion in assets, said an increasing number of ethics-focused investors were avoiding Facebook and other social media companies, even before the most recent reports about privacy breaches.","“More investors are starting to question whether these companies are contributing to a fair and well-informed public marketplace, or are we becoming all the more fragmented because of the ways in which these companies are operating,” she said.","New EU privacy rules","Facebook is also facing substantial business risks from new European Union privacy rules set to take effect in May.","Privacy experts said the data harvesting scandal was a prime example of the kinds of practices the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is supposed to prevent or punish.","The danger faced by Facebook going forward is two-fold: Complying with the rules means letting European users opt out of the highly targeted online ads that have made Facebook a money machine. Violating GDPR mandates could subject the company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.","Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it “would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue”, said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems.","Because a UK company (Cambridge Analytica) was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, the GDPR would have applied.","Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users. Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.","“The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn’t adequately monitoring what third parties were doing,” said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild.","Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.","Facebook on Monday said it changed its policies in 2015 to “to give much less data, especially about friends\".","“We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,” the company said.","“We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.”","Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money. Deutsche Bank analysts in January estimated that Facebook’s overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent.","The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue.","“If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,” Deutsche Bank warned.","The firestorm over Cambridge Analytica has prompted a furious response from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, raising the prospect of just such an expansion of privacy protections.","GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies. Social networks will also need to regain Europeans’ consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.","Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.","“There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,” she said.","Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.","For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.","The company did not make those features available in Europe. Facebook did not specify a reason. But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.","Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions. The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented “in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language\".","In other words, the days of extensive “terms of service” agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, according to privacy lawyers.","In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more “permissions screens” and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.","That could depress usage, Facebook CFO David Wehner said at an investor conference last month.","“Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there’s some potential that people decide they’re not going to use the product,” Wehner said.","\"We don’t think it will be big, but there could be some implication there.”","All rights reserved.

It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says. Users can turn this permission off at any time, and Facebook said it doesn’t sell that information to third parties. The data is used in the algorithms that help Facebook recommend friends.","There’s a ton of other information in the downloadable data, including every Facebook message you’ve ever sent or received, your entire Facebook timeline and a list of third-party advertisers who have your contact information. According to Facebook, that download might also include the “unique number” Facebook assigns to you for facial recognition purposes, based on the photos you’ve been tagged in on the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

Revelations over the weekend about its reckless sharing of user data sent its stock price plunging on Monday, and fresh calls for regulations on the social media network are looking more real than ever.","In the last few days, multipleoutlets broke various facets of the story: Facebook has known since 2015 that Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining company hired by President Trump’s election campaign, improperly obtained the personal data of 50 million of the network’s users—and the social giant failed to do much of anything about it. In a blog post on Friday, Facebook said it has suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL, while it investigates their alleged failure to comply with an agreement to delete the ill-gotten data.","Advertisement","The particulars of this case are relatively complex, but the most important thing to understand is that Facebook collects an enormous amount of data about its users, and it lost control of that data. When it found out, it asked the bad actors responsible to promise they would delete the data. Now Facebook claims that Cambridge Analytica and SCL may have failed to fulfill that promise. And whatever you do, Facebook execs say, don’t call this a “breach.”","So after years of Facebook big shots telling us to just trust them when it comes to the ways it handles our data and targets us with advertising, a third-party allegedly violated Facebook’s trust. In the past, the company has met such scandals with a mixture of outright denials and promises to change, while mostly maintaining the status quo—and its bottom line just kept growing. On Monday, early market signs showed the dam could be breaking.","This morning, Reuters reported that Facebook’s stock fell more than 4 percent in premarket trading.

But this time feels a bit different.","Lawmakers around the world have vocally called for regulations, hearings, and investigations into this incident over the last few days and more continue to chime in. New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone insisted on Monday that “the Energy and Commerce Committee must hold hearings soon.” That follows Minnesota Sen.

And politicians around the globe are dealing with populist uprisings fueled by outside actors agitating through Facebook—in other words, they have an ax to grind.","All of the mega-corporations of tech have misdeeds to account for, but Facebook is relatively unique in the ways that its platform has been used, and the extremely personal information it collects.","Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytics employee who blew the whistle on this case, claimed in an interview with The Guardian that he “made Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool.” While Wylie may have made the tool, it seems more and more clear that Mark Zuckerberg provided the steel, the forge, and the target."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

As smart as artificial intelligence gets, it is still not up to many critical job tasks that are required to protect companies from risks that can destroy not only bottom lines but reputations. The number of new jobs being created by Facebook reflects the scope of the challenge.","Facebook is adding 5,000 jobs before the end of the year in security and community operations. That is on top of 5,000 new positions already added this year. By year-end Facebook jobs in these areas will have increased from 10,000 to 20,000 (the teams involved are at 15,000 currently).","One position, content reviewer, is already staffed by Facebook with 7,500 workers. That's roughly the same number of employees as the entire workforce of Twitter and Snap combined. The 5,000 Facebook workers still to be added this year is a larger number than either of those companies, and represents 20 percent of Facebook's reported total employee level of approximately 25,000.","Toby Melville | Reuters","An employee waits for an elevator at a Facebook office.","Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg told CNBC on Thursday, \"We need to do more; we continue to do more. We are massively ramping hiring. We are going to continue to ramp even faster.\"","It was Facebook CEO's Mark Zuckerberg's comments to the New York Times and Wired, though, that laid out the limitations of A.I. and the need for human hiring. \"One of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company. It's not all A.I., right? There's certainly a lot that A.I. can do. We can train classifiers to identify content, but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at. So we're going to double the amount of people working on security this year. ... So it's really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal,\" he told the Times.","A.I. is not yet 'solved'","The Facebook CEO told Wired that when he started Facebook in 2004, \"People shared stuff and then they flagged it and we tried to look at it. But no one was saying, 'Hey, you should be able to proactively know every time someone posts something bad,' because the A.I. tech was much less evolved, and we were a couple of people in a dorm room. ... But now you fast-forward almost 15 years and A.I. is not solved, but it is improving.\"","He also said, \"As A.I. tools get better and better, will be able to proactively determine what might be offensive content or violate some rules, what therefore is the responsibility and legal responsibility of companies to do that?\"","Sandberg told CNBC that A.I. can catch \"99 percent\" of the \"bad actors\" in some content areas, but internet watchdogs are less sure, and after a week that was the worst for Facebook shares since 2012 — and saw tens of billions in Facebook market capitalization erased daily — it seems like the \"responsibility\" of companies merits more spending on human talent. Simply put, algorithms are not as good as people at context.","\"What we are learning is that you can't just throw more A.I. at a lot of these problems. You need people who understand how to train these systems so that they have the insight they need, and then how to monitor them,\" said Natasha Duarte, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy & Technology. \"They have to review flagged content and see what the tools might be missing, and understand how to go back and add training and data and try to improve the tools accuracy.\"","Facebook is looking for workers to fill jobs in content moderation — \"content reviewers\" — who are tasked with taking correct action on a reported piece of content based on the company's Community Standards. The focus in hiring for this type of role is language and market knowledge to ensure the company has the most appropriate cultural context to cover content coming from all over the world, according to information provided to CNBC.","These people work to detect fake accounts, improve authentication, reduce harassment and scams and promote child safety, among other tasks related to safety. Facebook moderators are paid above average in the industry, according to information provided by Facebook to CNBC, and are offered additional benefits, which include resiliency training (stress-related training) and support.","\"It is a topic of conversation that comes up with increasing frequency. It's bleeding edge, A.I. and machine learning and analytics and data scientists, and all of it wraps into this one space with lots of buzzwords, which leads to lots of ambiguity.\"-Samantha Wallace, a technology practice leader at Korn Ferry","Diversity in hiring is also key, a Facebook spokesperson told CNBC.","Duarte said diversity in hiring is critical. \"If you ask me what I think is the most important, whoever tech companies hire, they need people from diverse backgrounds, racially diverse and diverse in terms of gender, and especially when we are talking about content moderation, there is a cultural element to that. You want to make sure people working on automated solutions for content are not just all from one cultural background.\"","The exact number of Facebook hires to be made in content review is not known and will be a part of the 5,000 new jobs spread across security and safety. The broader team includes experts in enforcement in areas like child safety, hate speech, counterterrorism and legal specialists. So it would include roles such as engineers or those who work directly with law enforcement. Not all of the new jobs are full-time with Facebook. The 5,000 jobs number includes a mix of full-time employees, independent contractors and outsourced positions managed by vendor partners, at least in part driven by the need to match the work with Facebook's needs across global time zones, languages and markets.","Samantha Wallace, who leads the technology practice for Korn Ferry's division that focuses on mid-level search, said the Facebook hiring drive reflects the difficulty companies are having in figuring out how to best take advantage of A.I. and how to not become overly confident in it at the same time.","\"It is a topic of conversation that comes up with increasing frequency,\" Wallace said. \"It's bleeding edge, A.I. and machine learning and analytics and data scientists, and all of it wraps into this one space with lots of buzzwords, which leads to lots of ambiguity.\"","Wallace said that she can't speak to Facebook's hiring specifically, but the search firm has found that outside of the core competencies related to A.I., which require advanced degrees in science and math, traits like curiosity and persistence and creativity are important for hiring in roles related to the massive amount of data. \"Harnessing it is one thing, and there's a technical role, but to make it something useful and strategic in decision-making requires non-technical traits within the A.I. world.\"","Wallace said there is an ocean of data that creates security and content issues, and that requires the subjective perspective from a human being to decide which pieces of data or content make it to the smaller pool that is widely shared. Google has in the past year been hiring more workers to filter terrorism-related content, but this isn't just an issue for social media companies, though they may feel it most acutely.","\"Across industries the content-management question is real for all organizations,\" Wallace said. \"In social media there is wide audience interacting with the platform on a daily basis, but others could be web-based or product descriptions disseminated through other channels. The content piece is important. ... These challenges are true for any organization, the integrity of data and security.\"","You can't build an algorithm to police the algorithm","\"We're a successful enough company that we can employ 15,000 people to work on security and all of the different forms of community [operations],\" Zuckerberg told the Times.","The Korn Ferry recruiter said there is a huge movement to fill these positions, but there is also ambiguity about the responsibilities of the positions because it's an emerging field.","\"I think across industries there is a tidal wave of need coming and there is an ongoing shortage of talent coming into the space,\" Wallace said. Companies aren't only playing catch-up but \"over-resourcing\" for these positions, she said, because they know they will have to \"upscale\" certain workers and create new skill sets in the future.","\"They know there will be a need and know there will be a shortage, so they build a team ... to make sure they have the resources in place when risks materialize in a critical way,\" Wallace said. She added, \"Organizations are moving to the 'We have to add these people now, even if we don't know what they will do, what we will do with them.'\"","\"You can't just build an algorithm to police the algorithm,\" Duarte said.","Companies need to have a diverse human pool with different academic backgrounds to come together and decide what a platform is really about and how a company wants it to serve users. Duarte said that if that task is left to A.I. and the engineers who build the code, they will invariably get it wrong.","\"Hate speech and sarcasm can be confused,\" Duarte said. \"It takes humans who understand the full scope and context to spot issues where we should be worried about an [A.I.] classifier going wrong.\"","She said Zuckerberg's comments about bridging the technical systems with the people in operations speaks to the potential divisions that stand in the way of proper decision-making. There are teams that work on content policy and on privacy policy and make the decisions to advocate for policies to govern platforms, and then there are the engineers who build the tools.","\"Ideally, you have integration between policy and engineers, so policy goals are then informing tool builds,\" Duarte said.","Even when companies like Facebook try to get it right in response to failings, the responses still have a history of failing themselves. Duarte pointed to her group's efforts to get Facebook to crack down on affinity targeting in ads, for example, routing ads related to homebuying away from minority groups — a social media ad version of the unfair mortgage and real estate industry practices that made homebuying for African Americans difficult for much of the 20th century.","In 2016 the Center for Democracy & Technology advocated for more rules and guidance around how advertisers could target those ads. Facebook said it was fixing the problem and put out a blog post on its efforts. A subsequent investigation by ProPublica found that the Facebook fix didn't fix the problem — ProPublica was able to serve ads in the exact way it shouldn't have been allowed to do anymore.","\"We can't just throw A.I. at it, and we don't want to have policy team and engineers siloed separately while building tools,\" Duarte said.","Getty Images","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg","One option for Facebook suggested this week by one of the New York Times reporters who interviewed Zuckerberg was to cut down on data and content issues by opting to go smaller — Facebook veering away from its free ad-supported model that makes malicious bots' manipulation more possible. Comments from the company's top brass shows that while it continues to consider a version of its platform that could be offered on a paid basis, there are few signs it thinks that's the way to go for the majority of its global audience.","Sandberg's comments on A.I. could seem to express overconfidence in it, or in the least, highlight the tension between man and machine. In addition to \"massively ramping\" hiring, she told CNBC, \"we are massively investing in machine learning and automation. ... There are areas where we've had great success. We take down 99 percent of ISIS or that kind of terrorist content before it even hits the platform. Machines make that possible and our commitment is clear.\"","\"Right now A.I. tools need to be thought of like a student. That is where you get the most value,\" Wallace said. \"But right now many actually operate like a 5-year-old. You are getting some benefit and insight but need to teach them, so they are a ways away from full impact. How we teach them will affect what happens to jobs subsequently.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens.

Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Using this data, the app can tell you how often your friends check WhatsApp. It can even estimate what time they go to sleep and wake up each day.","Even more impressive (and invasive), Chatwatch can combine WhatsApp data from two of your contacts to make an educated guess if they’ve been talking to each other.

Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP","Barack Obama's re-election team are building a vast digital data operation that for the first time combines a unified database on millions of Americans with the power of Facebook to target individual voters to a degree never achieved before.","Digital analysts predict this will be the first election cycle in which Facebook could become a dominant political force. The social media giant has grown exponentially since the last presidential election, rendering it for the first time a major campaigning tool that has the potential to transform friendship into a political weapon.","Facebook is also being seen as a source of invaluable data on voters. The re-election team, Obama for America, will be inviting its supporters to log on to the campaign website via Facebook, thus allowing the campaign to access their personal data and add it to the central data store – the largest, most detailed and potentially most powerful in the history of political campaigns. If 2008 was all about social media, 2012 is destined to become the \"data election\".","\"Facebook is now ubiquitous,\" says Dan Siroker, a former Google digital analyst who joined Obama's campaign in 2008 and now runs his own San Francisco-based analytics consultancy, Optimizely. \"Whichever candidate uses Facebook the most effectively could win the war.\"","For the past nine months a crack team of some of America's top data wonks has occupied an entire floor of the Prudential building in Chicago devising a digital campaign from the bottom up. The team draws much of its style and inspiration from the corporate sector, with its driving ambition to create a vote-garnering machine that is smooth, unobtrusive and ruthlessly efficient.","Already more than 100 geeks, some recruited at top-flight university job fairs including Stanford, are assembled in the Prudential drawn from an array of disciplines: statisticians, predictive modellers, data mining experts, mathematicians, software engineers, bloggers, internet advertising experts and online organisers.","At the core is a single beating heart – a unified computer database that gathers and refines information on millions of committed and potential Obama voters. The database will allow staff and volunteers at all levels of the campaign – from the top strategists answering directly to Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina to the lowliest canvasser on the doorsteps of Ohio – to unlock knowledge about individual voters and use it to target personalised messages that they hope will mobilise voters where it counts most.","Every time an individual volunteers to help out – for instance by offering to host a fundraising party for the president – he or she will be asked to log onto the re-election website with their Facebook credentials. That in turn will engage Facebook Connect, the digital interface that shares a user's personal information with a third party.","Consciously or otherwise, the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they store publicly on their Facebook page – home location, date of birth, interests and, crucially, network of friends – directly into the central Obama database.","\"If you log in with Facebook, now the campaign has connected you with all your relationships,\" a digital campaign organiser who has worked on behalf of Obama says.","The potential benefits of the strategy can already be felt. The Obama campaign this year has attracted about 1.3 million donors, 98% of whom have contributed $250 or less – that's more than double the number at the same stage in 2008. At this rate, Obama is also well on the way towards staging the world's first billion-dollar campaign.","Under its motto \"Bigger, better, 2012\", the Chicago team intends between now and election day in November to create a campaign powerhouse which will allow fundraisers, advertisers and state and local organisers to draw from the same data source.","Joe Rospars, the campaign's chief digital strategist, told a seminar at the Guardian-sponsored Social Media Week that the aim was to create technology that encourages voters to get involved, in tune with Obama's emphasis on community organising.","Campaign insiders say that the emphasis this year will be on efficiency more than any headline-grabbing technical wizardry. But that should not obscure how significant this year's presidential cycle will be in putting to the test the first custom-made digital campaign.","Mark Sullivan, founder of Voter Activation Network, which manages the Democratic party's central database of voter information known as Vote Builder, says that \"what we will see in 2012 will make 2008 look really primitive\".","Judith Freeman of New Organizing Institute, who worked on both John Kerry's 2004 and Obama's 2008 presidential campaigns, says there is a leap forward in technology every presidential cycle, and 2012 would be no exception. \"There's a deadline – it's got to be done by election day – and that provides a huge push to make things happen.\"","In 2008 the Obama digital team was lauded around the world for its groundbreaking work on internet fundraising. Yet in fact, the separation of its data on voters into several distinct silos forced high-level staffers to spend hours manually downloading information from one database to another.","The Obama team in 2008 did a good job in beginning to tear down those walls, releasing extraordinary fundraising energy in the process that raised about $500m online.","This year the Chicago team hasn't knocked down the walls so much as dispensed with them altogether. They have built from the ground up a unified database that incorporates and connects everything the campaign knows about a voter within it.","Rospars said that in 2012 they no longer had to try to integrate data in the campaign. \"We are just one campaign now – we built it from scratch.\"","The centralised nature of the database may raise privacy issues as the election cycle progresses. Jeff Chester of the digital advertising watchdog Center for Digital Democracy, which has been calling for regulators to review the growth of digital marketing in politics, said that \"this is beyond J Edgar Hoover's dream. In its rush to exploit the power of digital data to win re-election, the Obama campaign appears to be ignoring the ethical and moral implications.\"","But from the vantage point of the campaign the benefits are evident.","\"Fusing your data into one central store is cheaper, quicker and allows you to be more targeted,\" said Jim Pugh, who was part of Obama's 2008 digital team and now works for the progressive online movement, Rebuild the Dream.","The Obama database incorporates Vote Builder, a store of essential information such as age, postal address, occupation and voting history drawn from the voter files of 190 million active voters. It lines up and matches those voter files with data gathered from online interactions with the president's supporters – notably the millions of pieces of information its army of canvassers collected across the nation during the 2008 race, a list of email addresses of supporters that it has amassed and that now stands at about 23 million, as well as the contact information of Obama's 25 million Facebook fans.","Facebook itself has been transformed as a political campaign tool since 2008, simply by dint of its exponential growth. Four years ago there were about 40 million Facebook users in the US; now there are more than 160 million – incorporating almost the entire voting public.","The significance of the fusion of Facebook and voter file data is hard to overemphasise. \"This is the Moneyball moment for politics,\" says Sam Graham-Felsen, Obama's chief blogger in 2008. \"If you can figure out how to leverage the power of friendship, that opens up incredible possibilities.\"","First among those possibilities is that the campaign can distribute customised content designed specifically for its Facebook fans to share with their much wider circle of friends. The messages can be honed to a particular demographic – age, gender, etc – as well as set of interests, and targeted on the most hotly contested parts of the most crucial battleground states.","\"Influencers\" – those people who tend to act as thought leaders among their friends on Facebook – can be identified and prioritised.","Teddy Goff, the digital director of the re-election team, told Social Media Week that as the year progresses there would be more and more \"persuasion through interaction\".","Individual voters would be given access to digital platforms from which they will be able to tell their own stories \"and that's far more powerful than anything we can say\", Goff said. \"That will be the story of this election. People's own stories really moves votes.\"","Goff said the campaign was focused on building relationships through social media. An Obama message would be crafted so that \"not only can it be passed to your friends but to those friends that we think are most in need of passing it on to\".","The bottom line is that if you are sent a message from your Facebook friend encouraging you to turn up to an event or donate to Obama, you are vastly more likely to respond than if the request comes from an anonymous campaign staffer.","The other door that data integration will further open in 2012 is personalised marketing. This has been the Holy Grail of political campaigners for decades: the idea that you can talk directly to voters and serve them customised messages.","In the old world of snail mail, that could be achieved to some degree through direct marketing – ie leaflets dropped into the letter box – but that is expensive and far too slow with today's 24-hour news cycle.","The fusion of information into a centralised database allows you to direct market online at much less cost and virtually instantaneously.","The technique has begun to spread widely among commercial businesses over the past year, and it is only a matter of time before such hyper-targeting is standard across political campaigns. Indeed, we've already started to see it this year.","The Obama campaign has already tailored a single donation request to 26 distinct segments of the voting public. The Republicans are also getting in on the act.","Michele Bachmann used customised online advertising in Iowa to reach Republican voters only, sending to their computers messages with a local spin for each of the state's 99 counties. That helped her win Iowa's vaunted straw poll in August 2011 (though that didn't help her in the long run). Rick Perry sent God-praising commercials to Iowans who listed themselves as evangelicals on Facebook.","The company CampaignGrid, that serves mainly Republican candidates, claims to be able to online market direct to targeted households. It has an integrated database on 110 million voters across America – some 65% of the electorate – to whom it can serve personalised ads, following them wherever they are browsing on the internet.","Jeff Dittus, the company's co-founder, illustrates what this means. He worked on behalf of one unidentified Republican presidential candidate, serving online ads in the Miami-Dade region of Florida specifically to 400,000 individuals who had voted in at least two of the four previous Republican primaries. The adverts were further customised for gender, and for Spanish speaking.","They were distributed to the individuals through internet ad exchanges that allow for instantaneous filtering of users the nanosecond they click onto a video on any one of four million websites. In that flash, if you fitted the criterion you were served with a 30-second pre-roll video from the candidate delivering a message to you that you would have found remarkably personal.","\"I'm sure this is the future of digital political campaigning,\" said CampaignGrid's CEO Jeff Dittus.","Drew Brighton, CEO of TargetSmart Communications, is hoping to do the same hyper-targeting for Democratic and progressive politicians and causes through his new product Target Blue. It matches up the details of up to 50m cookies embedded on individual computers with voter files and uses it to identify Democratic-leaning individuals to whom it can serve customised ads wherever they go on the web.","The company is also developing a system for targeting Democratic voters through their computer IP addresses down to such tightly drawn areas or \"IP zones\" as just 20 households. That allows for micro-targeting depending on the average income bracket, age profile and concerns of that tiny locality.","The elephant in the room, of course, is television, which continues to dominate advertising spending by political campaigns. Most analysts agree that 2012 has come too soon for any equally transformative leaps forward in targeted or \"addressable\" TV advertising.","Cable television can close in on geographic zones ranging from a few thousand to up to 100,000 viewers allowing campaigns to shape their messages to those clusters. The tighter the geographical area that can be drawn, the more efficient the TV advertising becomes as campaign managers can focus on primarily-Democratic, Republican or independent neighbourhoods.","But its still a relatively blunt instrument. The prize would be to be able to fuse cable subscriptions with voter files so that TV adverts could be sent to households of a specific political persuasion.","Technically, that's already possible. Comcast Spotlight, the advertising arm of Comcast Cable, has run trials of commercial as opposed to political addressable advertising in Baltimore. Adverts custom-made to speak to various demographic groups were piped into 60,000 identified households, though the personal details were removed to protect privacy. The results confirmed the power of the technology: homes receiving addressable adverts tuned away a third less of the time than homes receiving untargeted commercials.","Dan Sinagoga, who specialises in political advertising at Comcast Spotlight, says that all advertisers, but political ones in particular, \"would like to be doing addressable advertising yesterday\". But he said it was unlikely to happen in any great quantity in 2012 as there are too many hurdles, including concerns in Washington about the privacy of cable TV consumers.","No such impediment will hold back the digital explosion this year. As an Obama insider puts it: \"Give us less wood, and we'll make more fire.\""],"isopubdate":"2012-02-17"}

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the runup to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Stamos' day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Stamos said he was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook's product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Now Playing:","Amid the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","Media: Fortune","Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company's executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook's image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","\"The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,\" said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Stamos said in statement Monday, \"These are really challenging issues, and I've had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.\" On Twitter, he said he was \"still fully engaged with my work at Facebook\" and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Despite the rumors, I'm still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Stamos' departure.","Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Sandberg, disagreed early on how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Stamos said his relationship with Sandberg was \"productive.\"","Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a \"pretty crazy idea.\"","In the ensuing months, Facebook's security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook's vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook's findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine the U.S. election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Stamos said in his statement that \"we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.\"","Related Stories","But Facebook's decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, Facebook had reversed course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the U.S. electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook's revelation was a good first step, \"I'm disappointed it's taken 10 months of raising this issue before they've become much more transparent.\"","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Zuckerberg and Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook's reputation in different countries, said Facebook is \"caught in a Catch-22.\"","\"Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don't want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,\" he said. \"But if they don't, it damages their image.\"","McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company's conduct.","By December 2017, Facebook executives decided to reassign Stamos' team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Stamos has largely been left as Facebook's security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook's representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Stamos tweeted in defense of the company. Facebook's communications staff had to approve Stamos' comments, according to two people briefed on the incident.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","\"I told them, 'Your business is based on trust, and you're losing trust,'\" said McNamee, a founder for the Center for Humane Technology. \"They were treating it as a PR problem, when it's a business problem. I couldn't believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","\"For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,\" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. \"I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.\"","The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized \"the right to be forgotten,\" allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","\"The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,\" said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking \"I Agree.\" The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to \"bracket off\" European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.","\"Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,\" she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. \"We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,\" it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","\"Cambridge Analytica's story sounds like a spy novel,\" he said. \"It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,\" he said. \"We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.\""],"isopubdate":""}

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez, Associated Press","State and federal officials turned up the heat on Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday as they sought answers about the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal.","California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and his counterparts in 36 states and territories sent a letter to Zuckerberg saying revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, obtained information on more than 50 million Facebook members raised “many serious” questions that the Menlo Park company needed to answer.","Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Zuckerberg, along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter, to Capitol Hill on April 10 to “discuss Facebook’s past and future policies regarding the protection and monitoring of consumer data.”","And the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that the agency has opened an investigation of Facebook, possibly including whether the company violated a 2011 settlement relating to data privacy.","Monday’s developments intensified what analyst Daniel Ives called the “hurricane-like storm” swirling over Facebook since the disclosure about the data obtained by Britain’s Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.","“This has just created more worries around the ‘Nightmare on Elm Street’ week that Facebook and Zuckerberg encountered,” said Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights.","On Sunday, Facebook took out ads in major newspapers apologizing for the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But the apologies weren’t enough for Becerra, who joined a long list that included attorneys general from Oregon, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, D.C, Hawaii, Guam and American Samoa.","“Facebook has made promises about users’ privacy in the past, and we need to know that users can trust Facebook,” the letter from the attorneys general said. “With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.”","Will Castleberry, Facebook’s vice president for state and local public policy, said in a statement that “attorneys general across the country have raised important questions and we appreciate their interest. Our internal review of the situation continues and we look forward to responding.”","The letter asked the company for an update “about how Facebook will allow users to more easily control the privacy” because its members still don’t know their personal data is available to third-party companies.","Cook County, the Illinois County that includes Chicago, filed a suit Friday claiming Facebook and Cambridge Analytica violated that state’s consumer fraud and deceptive business practices laws.","Facebook stock posted a slight gain in trading Monday, although the overall market surged. The stock price initially slumped after the FTC confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook’s privacy practices.","Tom Pahl, the FTC’s acting director of consumer protection, issued a statement saying that the agency is probing whether the company has engaged in “unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers.”","Pahl noted that in 2011, Facebook agreed to a settlement of an FTC complaint about its use of users’ information. The commission said the company deceived consumers by failing to keep promises to protect the privacy rights of its then-800 million members. Facebook now has more than 2 billion members.","Reports surfaced last week that the FTC had started an investigation, but the agency did not confirm the probe until Pahl issued his statement.","“Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,” Pahl said. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.”","Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, said in a statement, “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”","The 2011 action settled an eight-count FTC complaint citing Facebook for privacy violations that occurred between October 2008 and May 2010. One complaint cited Facebook for allowing third-party apps access to more personal data than they needed.","“Facebook represented that third-party apps that users installed would have access only to user information that they needed to operate,” the FTC said. “In fact, the apps could access nearly all of users’ personal data — data the apps didn’t need.”","Facebook, which in 2011 had not yet become a public company, agreed to tighten its privacy controls and submit to an independent audit every two years for the next 20 years. Jon Leibowitz, then chairman of the FTC, said that future violations of the terms of the settlement would carry a fine of up to $16,000 per day per violation.","When asked about those audits, an FTC spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Pahl’s statement.","The Electronic Privacy Information Center complained that the case showed the FTC “failed” to enforce the settlement to prevent incidents like Cambridge Analytica from occurring.","Bart Lazar, a privacy attorney with Seyfarth Shaw in Chicago, said the FTC may have difficulty finding that Facebook was liable for the actions of a third party.","“I suppose the FTC could craft an argument that’s based on the fact that Facebook knew or should have known what was going on with respect to the use of the data,” Lazar said. He also said the U.S. does not have a baseline law covering privacy protections, “just a hodgepodge of federal and state laws.”","And if the FTC finds there were violations, determining the amount of civil penalties Facebook could have to pay could depend on whether the violations apply to each of the 50 million members whose data was misused or to just one instance of Cambridge Analytica misusing the data, Lazar said.","Besides Grassley, several House and Senate members have invited Zuckerberg to testify before various committees. Grassley, however, scheduled a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, specifically to discuss privacy standards and data use.","Grassley also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss the future of social media data privacy and developing “rules of the road.”","Facebook confirmed the company received the invitation, but did not say whether Zuckerberg would accept. Google declined to comment, while Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said over the weekend at a conference in Beijing that “well-crafted” regulations may be needed to govern data privacy."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The ability to combine this location data with information about who appears in those photos—and any social media contacts tied to them—would make it possible for government agencies to quickly track terrorist groups posting propaganda photos. (And, really, just about anyone else.)","For many photos taken with smartphones (and with some consumer cameras), geolocation information is saved with the image by default. The location is stored in the Exif (Exchangable Image File Format) data of the photo itself unless geolocation services are turned off. If you have used Apple's iCloud photo store or Google Photos, you've probably created a rich map of your pattern of life through geotagged metadata. However, this location data is pruned off for privacy reasons when images are uploaded to some social media services, and privacy-conscious photographers (particularly those concerned about potential drone strikes) will purposely disable geotagging on their devices and social media accounts.","Further Reading","That's a problem for intelligence analysts, since the work of trying to identify a photo's location without geolocation metadata can be \"extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive,\" as IARPA's description of the Finder program notes. Past research projects have tried to estimate the location where images were taken, learning from large existing sets of geotagged photos. Such research has resulted in systems like Google's PlaNet—a neural network-based system trained on 126 million images with Exif geolocation tags. But this sort of system falls apart in places where there haven't been many photos taken with geolocation turned on—places tourists tend not to wander to, like Eastern Syria.","Further Reading","The Finder program seeks to fill in the gaps in photo and video geolocation by developing technologies that build on analysts' own geolocation skills, taking in images from diverse, publicly available sources to identify elements of terrain or the visible skyline. In addition to photos, the system will pull its imagery from sources such as commercial satellite and orthogonal imagery. The goal of the program's contractors—Applied Research Associates, BAE Systems, Leidos (the company formerly known as Science Applications Incorporated), and Object Video—is a system that can identify the location of photos or video \"in any outdoor terrestrial location.\"","Finder is but one of several image processing projects underway at IARPA.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

Outraged sufferers of life-threatening allergies suddenly forced to pay 500% more for a previously affordable medicine, and the CEO essentially responding, “We’re here to make money” (Mylan’s EpiPen). Bank account holders notified about fraudulent accounts set up in their names expressly to allow executives and managers to reach their sales quotas (Wells Fargo). Shoppers navigating bare, dirty stores, and endless check-out lines before bolting to competitors (Walmart). And those organizations turning to a news conference, a press release, a catchy marketing slogan, or TV interviews, with the belief the tactic will make the problem go away.","PR can minimize the damage caused by operational and managerial missteps, but it can’t fix stupid.","“I’ve often seen leaders think that a crisis can be resolved in a day or two, in the misguided belief that things can’t get worse,” said Stephanie Nora White, founder and managing partner of WPNT Ltd., an international communications consultancy. “While the acute phase of a crisis may end quickly, true change comes from living through it, as difficult as that may be. Much of the heavy lifting that will reveal the root cause and changes necessary to fix the problem usually don’t come until later, and require real work and commitment.”","In short, recovery from crises and controversies requires more than PR. Here’s a start on what to do:","1. Run an organization where blunders are the exception, not the rule. Tomes have been written about how organizations can operate in a responsible manner. The Cliff Notes version is that doing the right thing is generally simple — but not always easy.","Southwest Airlines seems to have learned this painful lesson after generating a social media firestorm in 2014 so big that even People magazine covered it. A Southwest frequent flier tweeted criticism about a flight’s callous boarding process and the flight attendant enforcing it. The airline kicked him and his two preschool-aged daughters off the flight and refused to re-book them on a later one unless he deleted the tweet. Fast-forward to October: I live-tweeted a disorganized and significantly delayed Southwest flight, along with tin-ear comments made to frustrated customers by the pilot, gate agent and flight attendant. Instead of getting booted off the plane for my Twitter tale, a Southwest representative contacted me that afternoon with an apology and voucher for future travel. My story stayed within the confines of a few tweets (until now) and I remain a loyal customer.","2. Communicate. From the beginning. The very beginning. Crisis communications practitioners used to refer to the “golden hour” after a crisis, the window during which companies could prepare and respond. Today, organizations are lucky if they get 10 minutes.","When AirAsia Flight 8501 disappeared in late 2014, it seemed a macabre déjà vu. Nine months earlier, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 also had vanished from the skies. However, unlike the unprepared Malaysia Airlines executives, AirAsia CEO Tan Sri Anthony Francis “Tony” Fernandes immediately stepped up and became the airline’s face during the disaster.","He personally briefed families of the flight’s passengers and crew. He consistently shared developing information with the news media and via social media. When the aircraft’s wreckage was discovered, he personally met with reporters and family members.","3. Show concern. Then act on it. Organizational controversies and crises are dramas at best, tragedies at worst. Either way, expressing genuine compassion for those affected is non-negotiable. After jacking up the price of EpiPens five-fold and seeing her own compensation skyrocket by about the same ratio—to $18.9 million a year—Mylan CEO Heather Bresch commented, “I am running a business to make money.” Contrast her remark with AirAsia’s Fernandes after Flight 8501’s crash: “The passengers were on my aircraft, and I have to take responsibility for that.” Fernandes then put his company’s money where his mouth was: AirAsia would provide industry-standard compensation to the victims’ families, rather than the significantly lower amounts required of his Indonesian-based airline.","4. Tell the truth. The whole truth. Ivy Lee is regarded as the founder of modern PR. Although his work took place in the early 1900s, when he saved Standard Oil from the reputational fallout of John Rockefeller’s robber-baron ways, his communication mantra proves prescient: “Tell the truth, because sooner or later, the public will find out anyway.” Accept the pain and rip off the proverbial Band-Aid at the beginning of the problem. People often accept the truth with a side of contrition; it’s hoodwinkery they don’t care for.","5. Fix what the public and/or your customers want fixed. Concretely. Specifically. The rest of Lee’s advice is what organizations struggle to implement: “If the public doesn’t like what you are doing, change your policies and bring them into line with what people want.”","Customers and clients often display a surprising capacity to forgive, but if an organization is cavalier or dismissive, its leaders shouldn’t be surprised when the public turns on them. Just ask Wells Fargo. The bank's stock price and reputation have plummeted in recent months after its executives tried to conceal a multiyear scandal and $185 million regulatory fine related to the secret, unauthorized creation of millions of customer accounts designed solely to help employees meet sales quotas and boost commissions.","Walmart’s expectations that its 1.4 million U.S. employees would be satisfied with low wages, few or non-existent benefits and erratic and unreliable work schedules have spawned PR nightmares and unionization efforts for the retail giant. When online competition began to erode the company’s profits, it undertook more cost-cutting, which left even fewer employees to serve customers, re-stock depleted shelves and clean dirty stores. The company initially responded with marketing slogans and PR campaigns. It’s now in the midst of a two-year, $2.7 billion investment designed to increase employee pay and training, and improve scheduling, all with an eye toward recovering some of its previous market dominance. Although far from scientific, I was recently in a Walmart for the first time in a couple of years and noted stocked shelves, gleaming floors and dozens of friendly employees asking if they could help before I even asked for any.","No matter how good an organization’s PR team is, it can’t fix stupid. So, operate an ethically managed, well-intentioned organization that does the right thing. And somewhere along the way, when a misstep or accident sends operations temporarily off the rails, your PR people can work from a point of strength, where recovery and even advancement is not only possible, but likely."],"isopubdate":"2016-12-02"}

If users had not adjusted their privacy settings on the social media outlet, however, the app didn’t just capture the survey responses — it also gathered as much data from each account as possible.","That data included information from Facebook users’ friends and contacts, as well.","\"So by you filling out my survey I capture 300 records on average right,\" Wylie told ITN Channel 4 News. \"And so that means that, all of a sudden, I only need to engage 50,000, 70,000, 100,000 people to get a really big data set really quickly, and it’s scaled really quickly. We were able to get upwards of 50 million plus Facebook records in the span of a couple of months.\"","Similar stories based on the same reporting also appeared in the New York Times and the Observer of London.","According to Wylie, the project was of particular importance to Steve Bannon, who later served as the chief executive of Trump's campaign. He added that the former head of the right-wing media organization Breitbart wanted to use the data netted by Cambridge Analytica to influence and galvanize the views of the American public.","\"Steve wanted weapons for his culture war, that’s what he wanted,\" Wylie said.","\"We offered him a way to accomplish what he wanted to do, which was change the culture of America,\" Wylie added.","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman refuted all of Wylie's claims, calling his decision to speak to the media \"a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\"","\"We were forced to take action against Mr. Christopher Wylie to prevent his misuse of the company's intellectual property and he is the subject of restraining undertakings in this regard,\" the spokesman said. \"It is clear that he has a grudge to bear and appears set on trying to damage the company.\"","But Wylie said in the initial interview that this wasn’t about getting back at Cambridge Analytica, noting that \"if it was about revenge I could have done this years ago.\"","Instead, Cambridge Analytica’s former director of research calls his whistleblowing a crisis of conscience.","\"It weighs on me that I played a pivotal role in setting up a company that I think has done a lot of harm to the democratic process in a lot of countries,\" Wylie said.","The idea behind the project was that political preferences can be predicted by personal details people voluntarily provide on their social media accounts. By analyzing the details that users share online, Cambridge Analytica could predict individual behavior, which included voter preferences and how to influence that preference.","CEO of Cambridge Analytica Alexander Nix speaks at the 2016 Concordia Summit - Day 1 at the Grand Hyatt New York on Sep. 19, 2016 in New York City.Bryan Bedder / Getty Images for Concordia Summit","\"Whenever you go and you like something you are giving me a clue as to who you are as a person,\" Wylie said. \"And so all of this can be captured very easily and run through an algorithm that learns who you are.\"","Wylie said that \"almost none\" of the people whose profiles were tapped were aware that Cambridge Analytica had harvested their data.","The research all began in 2013 at Cambridge University, according to ITN Channel 4 News, where the university's psychometrics center began to examine the psychology behind Facebook and what information could be gleaned by pulling the data from user profiles.","According to Wylie, Bannon hoped to use that research and replicate it on a massive scale across the American electorate to buoy his influence campaign in 2014 and again in the 2016 presidential campaign. Billionaire Republican donors Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebecca — who own a portion of Cambridge Analytica — put Bannon in contact with the founder of the method, Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan, ITN Channel 4 News.","\"Kogan didn’t make any money off of it, he didn't,\" Wylie said. \"He did it for free, and what he got out of it was the giant data set and what [Cambridge Analytica] got out of it was also data, everyone got data. But Cambridge Analytica paid for it directly.\"","Cambridge Analytica appeared to lay the blame on Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), which is not associated with Cambridge University.","\"This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement issued Saturday.","\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" the statement added.","According to ITN Channel 4 News, Kogan said he held the right to use the data for commercial purposes and did nothing wrong.","Meanwhile, the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5 million to help target voters. The company told NBC News mere days before the 2016 election that it held data on 230 million American adults with approximately 4,000 “data points” on each of them.","The company denied, however, using any data that was harvested from Facebook via Kogan’s methods to help the Trump campaign.","\"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" the company added in Saturday's statement.","Facebook said in a statement that \"Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook.\" The social media provider added that Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan had told the company that all the data initially obtained by the app had been destroyed.","\"In light of new reports that the data was not destroyed, we are suspending these three parties from Facebook, pending further information,\" Facebook said. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties.\"","The social media company also insists that this did not constitute a data breach, as users technically consented — via their privacy settings — to allow Cambridge Analytica to harvest their data.","But Wylie does not think Facebook is completely innocent, as the social media giant first knew of the data gathering in 2015.","\"Why Facebook didn't, you know, make more enquiries when they started seeing that, you know, tens of millions of records were being pulled this way? I don’t know you’d have to ask Facebook that,\" Wylie said. \"But Facebook at least in a technical sense facilitated the project because they had applications that had these permissions in the first place.\"","According to Wylie, Facebook never checked that they had deleted the data, only requiring that Cambridge Analytica fill out a form.","And thanks to the lack of oversight, this influence-peddling company was able to \"move into the hearts and minds of American voters in a way that had never been done before.\"","And they did it in a way that entered a more than ethical grey area, according to Wylie, who claims they attempted to manipulate voters by latching onto their vulnerabilities.","\"This gets at the heart of, you know, why is it that you’re taking this psychological approach?\" he said. \"Why is it that you need to study things like shame proneness in people?

Silence amid Facebook’s data scandal is not","text":["With news on Friday that Cambridge Analytica was able to harvest the data of millions of Facebook users, the world’s largest social network is now more than three days into one of the biggest privacy scandals in its history (which is saying a lot). Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally lost $6 billion yesterday as Facebook’s cratering stock price led a massive sell-off of tech-sector shares on Wall Street, and members of Congress have written a letter to Zuckerberg demanding answers.","But unlike with past scandals, where Zuckerberg would respond with sweeping manifestos about Facebook’s mission to connect the world, the CEO has yet to publicly address the Cambridge Analytica brouhaha. Instead, that responsibility seems to have fallen to Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Facebook’s vice president of AR/VR, who has been actively jousting with critics on Twitter, intent on driving home the point that Facebook did not–technically–suffer a “data breach.” Yesterday, Boz doubled down on damage control, posting on his personal Facebook page an expanded timeline of events related to the scandal.","Meanwhile, the question of Zuckerberg’s silence is practically becoming its own meme, with the hashtag #WheresZuck making the rounds on Twitter throughout much of the day yesterday.

Earlier, it was said that the company did so without asking the users. But according to Facebook’s latest blog post, it’s not true.","In their defense, Facebook said that the continuous logging of call logs and SMS history was “a part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android.” Facebook starts its continuous data scooping after the user agrees to enable the contacts sharing feature in Messenger or Facebook Lite during the sign-in process or later in the apps.","The company says that the data collected can help them improve the experience for the people. But they failed to mention exactly what kind of experience they are talking about.","Facebook claims that they never sell this data and the actual content of the texts or calls isn’t uploaded to their servers. Also, the company argues that it is common for social apps and services to deploy contact importers “as a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with.”","Fortunately, on iOS devices, the data collection isn’t possible because of Apple’s strict privacy policies.

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

Take this quiz to find out!\") or maybe at the behest of a friend who's a Meyers-Briggs believer. But these fluffy diversions have a serious, often dark history. In fact, one of the earliest personality tests was developed during World War II to determine who might become an authoritarian and join the Nazi movement.","In 1943, three psychology professors at the University of California at Berkeley were struggling to understand the most horrific European genocide in a generation. As the war raged overseas, Daniel Levinson, Nevitt Sanford, and Else Frenkel-Brunswik decided to use the greatest power at their disposal—scientific rationality—to stop fascism from ever rising again. They did it by inventing a personality test eventually named the F-scale, which they believed could identify potential authoritarians. This wasn't some plot to weed out bad guys. The researchers wanted to understand why some people are seduced by political figures like Adolf Hitler, and they had a very idealistic plan to improve education so that young people would become more skeptical of Hitler's us-or-them politics.","The rise of personality testing","As they cooked up a research plan, the Berkeley group borrowed ideas from a somewhat checkered tradition in psychology that held that personalities could be broken down into discrete character traits. In the late nineteenth century, pseudoscientists like Francis Galton, best known for popularizing the idea of eugenics, believed that human \"character\" could be measured the same way \"the temper of a dog can be tested.\" This idea gained traction, and the first personality tests were developed by the US Army during World War I so millions of soldiers could be tested for vulnerability to \"shell shock,\" an early term for post-traumatic stress.","R. Nevitt Sanford, co-author of The Authoritarian Personality, was a professor of psychology at UC Berkeley. He was fired in 1950, the year the book was published, for refusing to sign a loyalty oath. He later founded the Wright Institute to reform higher education.","If we could test soldiers for shell shock, why not test citizens for anti-Semitism and a tendency to follow dictators? That's what the Berkeley researchers decided to do. Their idea was compelling enough to net them a grant of $500 from the psychology department in 1943. In the year that followed, Sanford, Frenkel-Brunswik, and Levinson created several versions of a personality test they hoped would identify potential authoritarians, their term for people who would follow leaders with fascist or genocidal tendencies. They conducted in-depth personal interviews and administered written personality tests to hundreds of Berkeley students. Some of the answers they got seemed to reflect democratic values, such as when a business student told them that he wanted to hire a diverse workforce and work with people from all over the world. Other answers suggested a less welcoming attitude toward outsiders: a pre-law student claimed he could always \"recognize\" Jews and called Jewish immigration \"a danger\" because it meant America would \"take on the burdens of people who have been misfits in other countries.\"","Theodor Adorno, a political philosopher, was the last to join the Berkeley group, which wrote The Authoritarian Personality. Adorno fled Germany during the rise of Nazism and became an internationally famous social critic. During the research for The Authoritarian Personality, he co-authored the book The Dialectic of Enlightenment, an attempt to explain how enlightenment values led to the rise of fascism.","Eventually the Berkeley group's publications caught the eye of prominent social scientist Max Horkheimer, who was on the board of a civil liberties organization called the American Jewish Committee. Founded in 1906 by people who wanted to put a stop to thepogromskillingJewsinRussia, the group was on the lookout for researchers who could explain how everyday prejudices erupted into the Holocaust. Horkheimer secured more funding for the project and introduced the data-minded Berkeley researchers to the rather dystopian political philosopher Theodor Adorno. At that point, the group expanded its scope, bringing qualitative analysis into their quantitative framework. This allowed them to perfect the F-scale test after several false starts.","The F-scale","To create a personality test that actually revealed latent authoritarianism, the researchers had to give up on the idea that there's a strong link between anti-Semitism and authoritarianism. That perspective was too limiting. Though their experiences with the Holocaust suggested a causal connection between hatred of Jews and the rise of fascism, it turned out that people with authoritarian tendencies were more accurately described as ethnocentric. Authoritarians believed their own group was superior and expressed racism against a wide range of other people. Frenkel-Brunswik conducted many of the interviews, and she writes in The Authoritarian Personality that the group adjusted its work accordingly, testing people for prejudice against blacks, Filipinos, and immigrants. It found that the common thread among all the high-scoring authoritarians was a generalized disgust with people who seemed different and therefore \"uncanny.\" When an authoritarian scored low on anti-Semitism, he or she was sure to score high on hatred of another outsider group.","Else Frenkel-Brunswik, co-author of The Authoritarian Personality, was a widely recognized expert on psychoanalysis and logical positivism. She fled Poland and Austria to escape the Nazis in 1938 and worked as a researcher and clinical psychiatrist at Berkeley. She conducted most of the quantitative analysis for the book and was especially interested in self-contradictory beliefs among authoritarians.","Another discovery was that authoritarians tended to distrust science and strongly disliked the idea of using imagination to solve problems. They preferred to stick to tried-and-true traditional methods of organizing society. Many believed that force was the best way to deal with conflict, partly because war is an inevitable outgrowth of human nature. Another personality trait that emerged had to do with sexuality. Authoritarians were rigidly opposed to homosexuality, occasionally suggesting that homosexuals should be killed or at least jailed. But more generally, they were fascinated by regulating other people's sex lives, often speculating about the \"wild sex life\" of groups they hated, whether those were artists, \"weak\" politicians, or racial minorities. Overall, the Berkeley group described authoritarians' outlook as \"cynical\" because of a tendency to believe the powerful would always rule the weak, and it was best to be on the side of the powerful, which is also likely why authoritarians expressed a desire for politicians who would take charge, set rules, and crush dissent.","As a result of these findings, the F-scale in its final form was intended to measure ethnocentrism, superstition, aggression, cynicism, conservatism, and an inordinate interest in the private sex lives of others as the building blocks for a personality drawn to authoritarian leaders. Now the group began to gather data on a much wider scale. They tested students at the University of Oregon and George Washington University, as well as union members, war vets, the inmates of San Quentin Prison, and patients at a psychiatric clinic.","At this link, we've recreated a version of the original F-scale test that the researchers administered, all questions included. Originally, people had the option to respond to each question using a sliding scale from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree,\" but I've simplified this to \"agree\" and \"disagree.\" As you'll see as you read through the questions, it's somewhat dated—remember, this was created in the late 1940s. To figure out your score, just add up how many times you checked \"agree.\" The higher your score, the closer you are to being authoritarian. You can see why this might make the test easy to game, since the non-authoritarian answer is always \"disagree.\" But the test's structure also created an additional problem. As University of Minnesota political psychologist Christopher Federico pointed out to Ars, there's a widely recognized psychological phenomenon called acquiescence bias, where some people have a predilection for agreeing with anything people say to them. So a high-scoring person might have authoritarian tendencies, but they might just suffer profoundly from acquiescence bias, too.","Though they hardly created the perfect test structure, the researchers were able to gather a fair amount of good data that's still considered relevant by scholars who study authoritarianism today. Harvard political scientist Pippa Norris told Ars that it \"set the paradigm in the field of social psychology.\""],"isopubdate":"2016-06-03"}

As we and others have reported, Cambridge Analytica ultimately partnered with the Donald Trump campaign to leverage the data of millions of Facebook users to target them with advertisements and campaign material. The original investigation into Cambridge Analytica, published on Motherboard in January 2017 and in German in Das Magazin in December 2016, follows below.","On November 9 at around 8.30 AM., Michal Kosinski woke up in the Hotel Sunnehus in Zurich. The 34-year-old researcher had come to give a lecture at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) about the dangers of Big Data and the digital revolution. Kosinski gives regular lectures on this topic all over the world. He is a leading expert in psychometrics, a data-driven sub-branch of psychology. When he turned on the TV that morning, he saw that the bombshell had exploded: contrary to forecasts by all leading statisticians, Donald J. Trump had been elected president of the United States.","For a long time, Kosinski watched the Trump victory celebrations and the results coming in from each state. He had a hunch that the outcome of the election might have something to do with his research. Finally, he took a deep breath and turned off the TV.","On the same day, a then little-known British company based in London sent out a press release: \"We are thrilled that our revolutionary approach to data-driven communication has played such an integral part in President-elect Trump's extraordinary win,\" Alexander James Ashburner Nix was quoted as saying. Nix is British, 41 years old, and CEO of Cambridge Analytica. He is always immaculately turned out in tailor-made suits and designer glasses, with his wavy blonde hair combed back from his forehead. His company wasn't just integral to Trump's online campaign, but to the UK's Brexit campaign as well.","Of these three players—reflective Kosinski, carefully groomed Nix and grinning Trump—one of them enabled the digital revolution, one of them executed it and one of them benefited from it.","How dangerous is big data?","Anyone who has not spent the last five years living on another planet will be familiar with the term Big Data. Big Data means, in essence, that everything we do, both on and offline, leaves digital traces. Every purchase we make with our cards, every search we type into Google, every movement we make when our mobile phone is in our pocket, every \"like\" is stored. Especially every \"like.\" For a long time, it was not entirely clear what use this data could have—except, perhaps, that we might find ads for high blood pressure remedies just after we've Googled \"reduce blood pressure.\"","On November 9, it became clear that maybe much more is possible. The company behind Trump's online campaign—the same company that had worked for Leave.EU in the very early stages of its \"Brexit\" campaign—was a Big Data company: Cambridge Analytica.","To understand the outcome of the election—and how political communication might work in the future—we need to begin with a strange incident at Cambridge University in 2014, at Kosinski's Psychometrics Center.","Psychometrics, sometimes also called psychographics, focuses on measuring psychological traits, such as personality. In the 1980s, two teams of psychologists developed a model that sought to assess human beings based on five personality traits, known as the \"Big Five.\" These are: openness (how open you are to new experiences?), conscientiousness (how much of a perfectionist are you?), extroversion (how sociable are you?), agreeableness (how considerate and cooperative you are?) and neuroticism (are you easily upset?). Based on these dimensions—they are also known as OCEAN, an acronym for openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, neuroticism—we can make a relatively accurate assessment of the kind of person in front of us. This includes their needs and fears, and how they are likely to behave. The \"Big Five\" has become the standard technique of psychometrics. But for a long time, the problem with this approach was data collection, because it involved filling out a complicated, highly personal questionnaire. Then came the Internet. And Facebook. And Kosinski.","Michal Kosinski was a student in Warsaw when his life took a new direction in 2008. He was accepted by Cambridge University to do his PhD at the Psychometrics Centre, one of the oldest institutions of this kind worldwide. Kosinski joined fellow student David Stillwell (now a lecturer at Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge) about a year after Stillwell had launched a little Facebook application in the days when the platform had not yet become the behemoth it is today. Their MyPersonality app enabled users to fill out different psychometric questionnaires, including a handful of psychological questions from the Big Five personality questionnaire (\"I panic easily,\" \"I contradict others\"). Based on the evaluation, users received a \"personality profile\"—individual Big Five values—and could opt-in to share their Facebook profile data with the researchers.","Followers of Lady Gaga were most probably extroverts, while those who \"liked\" philosophy tended to be introverts.","Kosinski had expected a few dozen college friends to fill in the questionnaire, but before long, hundreds, thousands, then millions of people had revealed their innermost convictions. Suddenly, the two doctoral candidates owned the largest dataset combining psychometric scores with Facebook profiles ever to be collected.","The approach that Kosinski and his colleagues developed over the next few years was actually quite simple. First, they provided test subjects with a questionnaire in the form of an online quiz. From their responses, the psychologists calculated the personal Big Five values of respondents. Kosinski's team then compared the results with all sorts of other online data from the subjects: what they \"liked,\" shared or posted on Facebook, or what gender, age, place of residence they specified, for example. This enabled the researchers to connect the dots and make correlations.","Remarkably reliable deductions could be drawn from simple online actions. For example, men who \"liked\" the cosmetics brand MAC were slightly more likely to be gay; one of the best indicators for heterosexuality was \"liking\" Wu-Tang Clan. Followers of Lady Gaga were most probably extroverts, while those who \"liked\" philosophy tended to be introverts. While each piece of such information is too weak to produce a reliable prediction, when tens, hundreds, or thousands of individual data points are combined, the resulting predictions become really accurate.","Kosinski and his team tirelessly refined their models. In 2012, Kosinski proved that on the basis of an average of 68 Facebook \"likes\" by a user, it was possible to predict their skin color (with 95 percent accuracy), their sexual orientation (88 percent accuracy), and their affiliation to the Democratic or Republican party (85 percent). But it didn't stop there. Intelligence, religious affiliation, as well as alcohol, cigarette and drug use, could all be determined. From the data it was even possible to deduce whether someone's parents were divorced.","The strength of their modeling was illustrated by how well it could predict a subject's answers. Kosinski continued to work on the models incessantly: before long, he was able to evaluate a person better than the average work colleague, merely on the basis of ten Facebook \"likes.\" Seventy \"likes\" were enough to outdo what a person's friends knew, 150 what their parents knew, and 300 \"likes\" what their partner knew. More \"likes\" could even surpass what a person thought they knew about themselves. On the day that Kosinski published these findings, he received two phone calls. The threat of a lawsuit and a job offer. Both from Facebook.","Michal Kosinski. Courtesy of Kosinski","Only weeks later Facebook \"likes\" became private by default. Before that, the default setting was that anyone on the internet could see your \"likes.\" But this was no obstacle to data collectors: while Kosinski always asked for the consent of Facebook users, many apps and online quizzes today require access to private data as a precondition for taking personality tests. (Anybody who wants to evaluate themselves based on their Facebook \"likes\" can do so on Kosinski's website, and then compare their results to those of a classic Ocean questionnaire, like that of the Cambridge Psychometrics Center.)","Our smartphone, Kosinski concluded, is a vast psychological questionnaire that we are constantly filling out, both consciously and unconsciously.","But it was not just about \"likes\" or even Facebook: Kosinski and his team could now ascribe Big Five values based purely on how many profile pictures a person has on Facebook, or how many contacts they have (a good indicator of extraversion). But we also reveal something about ourselves even when we're not online. For example, the motion sensor on our phone reveals how quickly we move and how far we travel (this correlates with emotional instability). Our smartphone, Kosinski concluded, is a vast psychological questionnaire that we are constantly filling out, both consciously and unconsciously.","Above all, however—and this is key—it also works in reverse: not only can psychological profiles be created from your data, but your data can also be used the other way round to search for specific profiles: all anxious fathers, all angry introverts, for example—or maybe even all undecided Democrats? Essentially, what Kosinski had invented was sort of a people search engine. He started to recognize the potential—but also the inherent danger—of his work.","To him, the internet had always seemed like a gift from heaven. What he really wanted was to give something back, to share. Data can be copied, so why shouldn't everyone benefit from it? It was the spirit of a whole generation, the beginning of a new era that transcended the limitations of the physical world. But what would happen, wondered Kosinski, if someone abused his people search engine to manipulate people? He began to add warnings to most of his scientific work. His approach, he warned, \"could pose a threat to an individual's well-being, freedom, or even life.\" But no one seemed to grasp what he meant.","Around this time, in early 2014, Kosinski was approached by a young assistant professor in the psychology department called Aleksandr Kogan. He said he was inquiring on behalf of a company that was interested in Kosinski's method, and wanted to access the MyPersonality database. Kogan wasn't at liberty to reveal for what purpose; he was bound to secrecy.","At first, Kosinski and his team considered this offer, as it would mean a great deal of money for the institute, but then he hesitated. Finally, Kosinski remembers, Kogan revealed the name of the company: SCL, or Strategic Communication Laboratories. Kosinski Googled the company: \"[We are] the premier election management agency,\" says the company's website. SCL provides marketing based on psychological modeling. One of its core focuses: Influencing elections. Influencing elections? Perturbed, Kosinski clicked through the pages. What kind of company was this? And what were these people planning?","What Kosinski did not know at the time: SCL is the parent of a group of companies. Who exactly owns SCL and its diverse branches is unclear, thanks to a convoluted corporate structure, the type seen in the UK Companies House, the Panama Papers, and the Delaware company registry. Some of the SCL offshoots have been involved in elections from Ukraine to Nigeria, helped the Nepalese monarch against the rebels, whereas others have developed methods to influence Eastern European and Afghan citizens for NATO. And, in 2013, SCL spun off a new company to participate in US elections: Cambridge Analytica.","Kosinski knew nothing about all this, but he had a bad feeling. \"The whole thing started to stink,\" he recalls. On further investigation, he discovered that Aleksandr Kogan had secretly registered a company doing business with SCL. According to a December 2015 report in The Guardian and to internal company documents given to Das Magazin, it emerges that SCL learned about Kosinski's method from Kogan.","Kosinski came to suspect that Kogan's company might have reproduced the Facebook \"Likes\"-based Big Five measurement tool in order to sell it to this election-influencing firm. He immediately broke off contact with Kogan and informed the director of the institute, sparking a complicated conflict within the university. The institute was worried about its reputation. Aleksandr Kogan then moved to Singapore, married, and changed his name to Dr. Spectre. Michal Kosinski finished his PhD, got a job offer from Stanford and moved to the US.","Mr. Brexit","All was quiet for about a year. Then, in November 2015, the more radical of the two Brexit campaigns, \"Leave.EU,\" supported by Nigel Farage, announced that it had commissioned a Big Data company to support its online campaign: Cambridge Analytica. The company's core strength: innovative political marketing—microtargeting—by measuring people's personality from their digital footprints, based on the OCEAN model.","After the Brexit result, friends and acquaintances wrote to him: Just look at what you've done.","Now Kosinski received emails asking what he had to do with it—the words Cambridge, personality, and analytics immediately made many people think of Kosinski. It was the first time he had heard of the company, which borrowed its name, it said, from its first employees, researchers from the university. Horrified, he looked at the website. Was his methodology being used on a grand scale for political purposes?","After the Brexit result, friends and acquaintances wrote to him: Just look at what you've done. Everywhere he went, Kosinski had to explain that he had nothing to do with this company. (It remains unclear how deeply Cambridge Analytica was involved in the Brexit campaign. Cambridge Analytica would not discuss such questions.)","For a few months, things are relatively quiet. Then, on September 19, 2016, just over a month before the US elections, the guitar riffs of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Bad Moon Rising\" fill the dark-blue hall of New York's Grand Hyatt hotel. The Concordia Summit is a kind of World Economic Forum in miniature. Decision-makers from all over the world have been invited, among them Swiss President Johann Schneider-Ammann. \"Please welcome to the stage Alexander Nix, chief executive officer of Cambridge Analytica,\" a smooth female voice announces. A slim man in a dark suit walks onto the stage. A hush falls. Many in attendance know that this is Trump's new digital strategy man. (A video of the presentation was posted on YouTube.)","A few weeks earlier, Trump had tweeted, somewhat cryptically, \"Soon you'll be calling me Mr. Brexit.\" Political observers had indeed noticed some striking similarities between Trump's agenda and that of the right-wing Brexit movement. But few had noticed the connection with Trump's recent hiring of a marketing company named Cambridge Analytica.","Alexander Nix. Image: Cambridge Analytica","\"Pretty much every message that Trump put out was data-driven,\" says Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix","Up to this point, Trump's digital campaign had consisted of more or less one person: Brad Parscale, a marketing entrepreneur and failed start-up founder who created a rudimentary website for Trump for $1,500. The 70-year-old Trump is not digitally savvy—there isn't even a computer on his office desk. Trump doesn't do emails, his personal assistant once revealed. She herself talked him into having a smartphone, from which he now tweets incessantly.","Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, relied heavily on the legacy of the first \"social-media president,\" Barack Obama. She had the address lists of the Democratic Party, worked with cutting-edge big data analysts from BlueLabs and received support from Google and DreamWorks. When it was announced in June 2016 that Trump had hired Cambridge Analytica, the establishment in Washington just turned up their noses. Foreign dudes in tailor-made suits who don't understand the country and its people? Seriously?","\"It is my privilege to speak to you today about the power of Big Data and psychographics in the electoral process.\" The logo of Cambridge Analytica— a brain composed of network nodes, like a map, appears behind Alexander Nix. \"Only 18 months ago, Senator Cruz was one of the less popular candidates,\" explains the blonde man in a cut-glass British accent, which puts Americans on edge the same way that a standard German accent can unsettle Swiss people. \"Less than 40 percent of the population had heard of him,\" another slide says. Cambridge Analytica had become involved in the US election campaign almost two years earlier, initially as a consultant for Republicans Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. Cruz—and later Trump—was funded primarily by the secretive US software billionaire Robert Mercer who, along with his daughter Rebekah, is reported to be the largest investor in Cambridge Analytica.","\"So how did he do this?\" Up to now, explains Nix, election campaigns have been organized based on demographic concepts. \"A really ridiculous idea. The idea that all women should receive the same message because of their gender—or all African Americans because of their race.\" What Nix meant is that while other campaigners so far have relied on demographics, Cambridge Analytica was using psychometrics.","Though this might be true, Cambridge Analytica's role within Cruz's campaign isn't undisputed. In December 2015 the Cruz team credited their rising success to psychological use of data and analytics. In Advertising Age, a political client said the embedded Cambridge staff was \"like an extra wheel,\" but found their core product, Cambridge's voter data modeling, still \"excellent.\" The campaign would pay the company at least $5.8 million to help identify voters in the Iowa caucuses, which Cruz won, before dropping out of the race in May.","Nix clicks to the next slide: five different faces, each face corresponding to a personality profile. It is the Big Five or OCEAN Model. \"At Cambridge,\" he said, \"we were able to form a model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.\" The hall is captivated. According to Nix, the success of Cambridge Analytica's marketing is based on a combination of three elements: behavioral science using the OCEAN Model, Big Data analysis, and ad targeting. Ad targeting is personalized advertising, aligned as accurately as possible to the personality of an individual consumer.","Nix candidly explains how his company does this. First, Cambridge Analytica buys personal data from a range of different sources, like land registries, automotive data, shopping data, bonus cards, club memberships, what magazines you read, what churches you attend. Nix displays the logos of globally active data brokers like Acxiom and Experian—in the US, almost all personal data is for sale. For example, if you want to know where Jewish women live, you can simply buy this information, phone numbers included. Now Cambridge Analytica aggregates this data with the electoral rolls of the Republican party and online data and calculates a Big Five personality profile. Digital footprints suddenly become real people with fears, needs, interests, and residential addresses.","The methodology looks quite similar to the one that Michal Kosinski once developed. Cambridge Analytica also uses, Nix told us, \"surveys on social media\" and Facebook data. And the company does exactly what Kosinski warned of: \"We have profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America—220 million people,\" Nix boasts.","He opens the screenshot. \"This is a data dashboard that we prepared for the Cruz campaign.\" A digital control center appears. On the left are diagrams; on the right, a map of Iowa, where Cruz won a surprisingly large number of votes in the primary. And on the map, there are hundreds of thousands of small red and blue dots. Nix narrows down the criteria: \"Republicans\"—the blue dots disappear; \"not yet convinced\"—more dots disappear; \"male\", and so on. Finally, only one name remains, including age, address, interests, personality and political inclination. How does Cambridge Analytica now target this person with an appropriate political message?","Alexander Nix at the 2016 Concordia Summit in New York. Image: Concordia Summit","Nix shows how psychographically categorized voters can be differently addressed, based on the example of gun rights, the 2nd Amendment: \"For a highly neurotic and conscientious audience the threat of a burglary—and the insurance policy of a gun.\" An image on the left shows the hand of an intruder smashing a window. The right side shows a man and a child standing in a field at sunset, both holding guns, clearly shooting ducks: \"Conversely, for a closed and agreeable audience. People who care about tradition, and habits, and family.\"","How to keep Clinton voters away from the ballot box","Trump's striking inconsistencies, his much-criticized fickleness, and the resulting array of contradictory messages, suddenly turned out to be his great asset: a different message for every voter. The notion that Trump acted like a perfectly opportunistic algorithm following audience reactions is something the mathematician Cathy O'Neil observed in August 2016.","These \"dark posts\"—sponsored Facebook posts that can only be seen by users with specific profiles—included videos aimed at African-Americans in which Hillary Clinton refers to black men as predators, for example.","\"Pretty much every message that Trump put out was data-driven,\" Alexander Nix remembers. On the day of the third presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, Trump's team tested 175,000 different ad variations for his arguments, in order to find the right versions above all via Facebook. The messages differed for the most part only in microscopic details, in order to target the recipients in the optimal psychological way: different headings, colors, captions, with a photo or video. This fine-tuning reaches all the way down to the smallest groups, Nix explained in an interview with us. \"We can address villages or apartment blocks in a targeted way. Even individuals.\"","In the Miami district of Little Haiti, for instance, Trump's campaign provided inhabitants with news about the failure of the Clinton Foundation following the earthquake in Haiti, in order to keep them from voting for Hillary Clinton. This was one of the goals: to keep potential Clinton voters (which include wavering left-wingers, African-Americans, and young women) away from the ballot box, to \"suppress\" their vote, as one senior campaign official told Bloomberg in the weeks before the election. These \"dark posts\"—sponsored news-feed-style ads in Facebook timelines that can only be seen by users with specific profiles—included videos aimed at African-Americans in which Hillary Clinton refers to black men as predators, for example.","Nix finishes his lecture at the Concordia Summit by stating that traditional blanket advertising is dead. \"My children will certainly never, ever understand this concept of mass communication.\" And before leaving the stage, he announced that since Cruz had left the race, the company was helping one of the remaining presidential candidates.","Just how precisely the American population was being targeted by Trump's digital troops at that moment was not visible, because they attacked less on mainstream TV and more with personalized messages on social media or digital TV. And while the Clinton team thought it was in the lead, based on demographic projections, Bloomberg journalist Sasha Issenberg was surprised to note on a visit to San Antonio—where Trump's digital campaign was based—that a \"second headquarters\" was being created. The embedded Cambridge Analytica team, apparently only a dozen people, received $100,000 from Trump in July, $250,000 in August, and $5 million in September. According to Nix, the company earned over $15 million overall. (The company is incorporated in the US, where laws regarding the release of personal data are more lax than in European Union countries. Whereas European privacy laws require a person to \"opt in\" to a release of data, those in the US permit data to be released unless a user \"opts out.\")","Groundgame, an app for election canvassing that integrates voter data with \"geospatial visualization technology,\" was used by campaigners for Trump and Brexit. Image: L2","The measures were radical: From July 2016, Trump's canvassers were provided with an app with which they could identify the political views and personality types of the inhabitants of a house. It was the same app provider used by Brexit campaigners. Trump's people only rang at the doors of houses that the app rated as receptive to his messages. The canvassers came prepared with guidelines for conversations tailored to the personality type of the resident. In turn, the canvassers fed the reactions into the app, and the new data flowed back to the dashboards of the Trump campaign.","Again, this is nothing new. The Democrats did similar things, but there is no evidence that they relied on psychometric profiling. Cambridge Analytica, however, divided the US population into 32 personality types, and focused on just 17 states. And just as Kosinski had established that men who like MAC cosmetics are slightly more likely to be gay, the company discovered that a preference for cars made in the US was a great indication of a potential Trump voter. Among other things, these findings now showed Trump which messages worked best and where. The decision to focus on Michigan and Wisconsin in the final weeks of the campaign was made on the basis of data analysis. The candidate became the instrument for implementing a big data model.","What's Next?","But to what extent did psychometric methods influence the outcome of the election? When asked, Cambridge Analytica was unwilling to provide any proof of the effectiveness of its campaign. And it is quite possible that the question is impossible to answer.","And yet there are clues: There is the fact of the surprising rise of Ted Cruz during the primaries. Also there was an increased number of voters in rural areas. There was the decline in the number of African-American early votes. The fact that Trump spent so little money may also be explained by the effectiveness of personality-based advertising. As does the fact that he invested far more in digital than TV campaigning compared to Hillary Clinton. Facebook proved to be the ultimate weapon and the best election campaigner, as Nix explained, and as comments by several core Trump campaigners demonstrate.","Cambridge Analytica counts among its clients the U.S. State Department, and has been reported to have communicated with British Prime Minister Theresa May, pictured here with Secretary of State John Kerry on July 19, 2016. Image: U.S. Dept. of State","Many voices have claimed that the statisticians lost the election because their predictions were so off the mark. But what if statisticians in fact helped win the election—but only those who were using the new method? It is an irony of history that Trump, who often grumbled about scientific research, used a highly scientific approach in his campaign.","Another big winner is Cambridge Analytica. Its board member Steve Bannon, former executive chair of the right-wing online newspaper Breitbart News, has been appointed as Donald Trump's senior counselor and chief strategist. Whilst Cambridge Analytica is not willing to comment on alleged ongoing talks with UK Prime Minister Theresa May, Alexander Nix claims that he is building up his client base worldwide, and that he has received inquiries from Switzerland, Germany, and Australia. His company is currently touring European conferences showcasing their success in the United States. This year three core countries of the EU are facing elections with resurgent populist parties: France, Holland and Germany. The electoral successes come at an opportune time, as the company is readying for a push into commercial advertising.","Kosinski has observed all of this from his office at Stanford. Following the US election, the university is in turmoil. Kosinski is responding to developments with the sharpest weapon available to a researcher: a scientific analysis. Together with his research colleague Sandra Matz, he has conducted a series of tests, which will soon be published. The initial results are alarming: The study shows the effectiveness of personality targeting by showing that marketers can attract up to 63 percent more clicks and up to 1,400 more conversions in real-life advertising campaigns on Facebook when matching products and marketing messages to consumers' personality characteristics. They further demonstrate the scalability of personality targeting by showing that the majority of Facebook Pages promoting products or brands are affected by personality and that large numbers of consumers can be accurately targeted based on a single Facebook Page.","In a statement after the German publication of this article, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said, \"Cambridge Analytica does not use data from Facebook. It has had no dealings with Dr. Michal Kosinski. It does not subcontract research. It does not use the same methodology. Psychographics was hardly used at all. Cambridge Analytica did not engage in efforts to discourage any Americans from casting their vote in the presidential election. Its efforts were solely directed towards increasing the number of voters in the election.\"","The world has been turned upside down. Great Britain is leaving the EU, Donald Trump is president of the United States of America. And in Stanford, Kosinski, who wanted to warn against the danger of using psychological targeting in a political setting, is once again receiving accusatory emails. \"No,\" says Kosinski, quietly and shaking his head. \"This is not my fault. I did not build the bomb. I only showed that it exists.\""],"isopubdate":"2017-01-28"}

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The results, so far, are a disaster.","Facebook announced late Friday that it had eliminated jobs in its trending module, the part of its news division where staff curated popular news for Facebook users. Over the weekend, the fully automated Facebook trending module pushed out a false story about Fox News host Megyn Kelly, a controversial piece about a comedian’s four-letter word attack on rightwing pundit Ann Coulter, and links to an article about a video of a man masturbating with a McDonald’s chicken sandwich.","In a blogpost, Facebook said the decision to drop people from the news module would allow it to operate at a greater scale.","“Our goal is to enable Trending for as many people as possible, which would be hard to do if we relied solely on summarizing topics by hand,” wrote a company representative in the unattributed post. “A more algorithmically driven process allows us to scale Trending to cover more topics and make it available to more people globally over time.”","Facebook news selection is in hands of editors not algorithms, documents show","Read more","A source familiar with the matter told the Guardian that the trending team was fired without notice in a meeting with a security guard present. The ex-employees received four weeks’ severance.","The past weekend has been less than auspicious for Facebook’s new, inhuman workforce: on Saturday, the site pushed an article to some of its users entitled: “BREAKING: Fox News Exposes Traitor Megyn Kelly, Kicks Her Out For Backing Hillary.” Megyn Kelly is still employed by Fox News and has not endorsed Hillary Clinton for president.","Facebook removed the offending article, published by a website called Ending the Fed and linking to another little known site, Conservative 101. Under Facebook’s old guidelines, news curators stuck to a list of trusted media sources. Neither of these sources were on that list.","Another surprising headline read: “SNL Star Calls Ann Coulter a Racist C*nt,” and referred to attacks on the author during a Comedy Central roast of actor Rob Lowe. Other trending items picked by algorithm were pegged to Twitter hashtags including #McChicken, a hashtag that had gone viral after someone posted a video of a man masturbating with a McChicken sandwich.","Under its old, human-assisted guidelines, Facebook trends had been monitored to weed out potentially offensive or inappropriate items.","The dismissal of the trending module team appears to have been a long-term plan at Facebook. A source told the Guardian the trending module was meant to have “learned” from the human editors’ curation decisions and was always meant to eventually reach full automation."],"isopubdate":"2016-08-29"}

Free labor is Facebook's lifeblood","text":["Tech","Forget data. Free labor is Facebook's lifeblood","Cambridge Analytica may have been the straw that broke the camel's back for Facebook users.","Image: bob al-greene/mashable","By Casey Williams2018-03-26 16:47:32 UTC","Chances are, you work for Facebook.","You probably don't have an office or an ID card. And you almost certainly don't get paid. But if you're one of the 239 million Americans who use the platform each month, your work is as valuable as a coder's. Maybe more. Your clicks, likes, and posts keep content circulating, users scrolling, and data streaming into algorithms used to serve you ads. Leave, and the platform crumbles.","You do two jobs for Facebook. You generate data and produce content. Facebook is essentially an advertising company, and every bit of information you disclose is data advertisers can use to influence how and what you buy. Sometimes it's fairly benign (maybe you do want that Blue Apron subscription). Other times it's not. Data is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to shape your behavior, and as Cambridge Analytica shows, it can be dangerous.","Your job is to drive people to the platform and keep them there","You also create most of what's on Facebook. You write posts, share photos, and capture live video of speeches, protests, and police shootings. The time and effort you sink into crafting a poetic confession, an impassioned rant, a thoughtful reflection on the day's news — think of it as work you do for Facebook. You're working to keep the site humming and vibrant, and you're creating reasons for others to keep scrolling. Your job is to drive people to the platform and keep them there.","And you spend a lot of time doing it. In 2016, users spent an average of 50 minutes a day using Facebook products, including Instagram and Messenger. That number has declined recently, but let's say you spend, say, 35 minutes a day on the site. That's 26 eight-hour days a year — \"more than any other leisure activity surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the exception of watching television programs and movies,\" according to the New York Times. \"It's more time than people spend reading (19 minutes); participating in sports or exercise (17 minutes); or social events (four minutes).\"","Time Well Spent?","Leisure is labor on Facebook. People use the app voluntarily, and yet, as more and more social activities relocate to the internet, it's increasingly work people feel they have to do to live meaningful, connected lives. Facebook is a News Feed, photo album, personal archive, community forum, and more. Think, for a second, about deleting Facebook. What will happen to your photos? Where will you get your news? Will anyone remember your birthday?","Like all social media companies, Facebook makes money from the basic labors of life: our need to maintain friendships and family ties, keep up with news, form and share beliefs about the world. \"What appears, at first glance, to be a free activity of communication,\" researchers at the University Lüneburg and University of Essex wrote in a recent paper, \"is in fact a form of 'free labor.'\"","It's valuable labor, too. The company earned nearly $16 billion in profit in 2017, according to its annual earnings report. Most of that was from ad revenue, which jumped nearly 50 percent.","Free labor has always made the U.S. economy hum. Slavery got the country on its feet, and unpaid house work — cooking, cleaning and child care, still done mostly by women — has for over two centuries made it possible for people to wake up every morning and go to work. The effort we put into caring for others is labor, and women still do most of that, too. While employers mostly benefit from this unpaid work indirectly, social media companies go right to the source. They extract value directly from the work we do to stay connected to the world.","This kind of extraction isn't unique to Facebook, or even to social media. The idea of a \"prosumer\" — a consumer who also produces — dates back to the 1980s. Sites like Yelp rely on users to generate reviews; Spotify asks listeners to fill in missing album data; Medium makes money from amateur writers looking to publish. Like Facebook, these sites often frame your work as an opportunity to \"connect\" or \"share.\" Not paying for this work is called \"crowdsourcing.\"","Critics of this model say it's exploitation. Eric Posner, a legal theorist at the University of Chicago, has called Twitter users a \"slave labor force,\" and small-time YouTube celebrities have objected to the platform's efforts to make it harder for YouTubers to monetize videos.","Whatever else it is, social media is work","Whatever else it is, social media is work. People who create content for a living understand this better than most. If you're a photographer, you have to be on Instagram. And if you're a journalist, you have to be on Twitter. It’s where you find breaking news, promote work, and get gigs — often on your own time. Ditching Twitter \"would be a disaster\" for writers and the companies they work for, Ethan Klapper, HuffPost’s global social media editor, told the New Republic in 2017.","The nonstop churn of social media skews what kind of work has monetary value. Amateur reporters break news before professionals, so media companies expect writers to churn out reports off the clock. And when the internet is awash in content, no one wants to shell out for words and images they can get for free.","Yes, a few social media users have figured out how to turn their work into cash. Modern celebrities like PewDiePie and the #vanlife couple have used social platforms to launch lucrative careers. It's easy to envy these people; after all, they rake in cash doing what everyone else does for free. But the fact that some people get paid is evidence of the value of every user's labor.","Maybe we all deserve a little something. After all, we don't really use Facebook; we make it.","Casey Williams is a writer based in Durham, North Carolina.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Most of the World’s data is held on private servers. The client-server architecture of the Internet and the design of corporate IT networks has resulted in data being hosted and stored on private and centralised databases. Lucrative consulting businesses sprung up to help organisations connect systems and try to make it easier share their data internally. Open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have gone some way into opening up data externally, especially in the public sector, but nevertheless these fixes are typically forced upon organisations. PSD2 is supposed to force banks to open up their data but they are doing their best to wriggle out of it. See Chris Skinner’s blog here.","Regulation and data privacy further limit sharing…","Even when organisations might be set up to share data and have a culture of sharing and collaboration, privacy laws and data protection legislation has had a chilling effect on data sharing. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the US or the Data Protection Act in the UK explicitly state what data can and cannot be shared. But these are complicated policies. The technical difficulty of implementing data policies, combined with the degradation of user experience those implementations produce, make IT systems costly, inefficient, and unpleasant to use. On top of which the security theatre that surrounds them only adds to the insecurity of participating with such systems. It’s just not worth it for people to go through the risk and hassle of sharing data.","It’s also really hard to make any money from sharing data…","Even when sharing is encouraged internally, technically possible with Open APIs, and legislation is favourable, current data infrastructure makes it difficult to monetise data. The best that happens is that external developers or citizens get free access to data. Lovely stuff for the user of the data, not so much for the publisher. There is no good way to get paid appropriately for published data. Some content can be published using an open-source license, sure, and attribution is great, but it doesn’t pay the bills. Dual-licensing for software is possible. See Oracle’s MySQL database which is dual-licensed under a commercial proprietary license and under the GPLv2 license. But in most cases licensing is costly, difficult to enforce and inefficient. Licensing of personal data is officially non-existent. Despite that in developing countries companies make money from this value. Around the world doctors use Facebook’s WhatsApp to send medical reports, nurses use Gmail to provide remedial advice, and that data, while not licensed, is published to advertisers as users uncaringly share the data.","So basically there is no business model for data sharing…","The fact is today there is no rational economic incentive for individuals to do anything other than give data away for free and for corporations to hoard it. If only there was a solution…","Blockchains are terrible databases, stop going on about it…","First and foremost, despite my clickbait-y headline I want to get this out of the way: public blockchains are in most ways worse than existing databases. They are slower, have less storage, are extremely energy-inefficient and in most cases less private (although zero-knowledge proofs 👏, self-sovereign identity 👏 and Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) 👏 will help this). But these are design choices are made to improve one feature: decentralisation. By decentralisation I mean the elimination of a central administrator which leads to extreme fault tolerance and increased data integrity and tamper-evidence. The removal of centralised control and vulnerable centralised data repositories has trade-offs which make most blockchains unsuitable for a ton of use cases that have been spoken about. But in cases where security and tamper-evidence is more important than throughput, speed, capacity, and stable governance, well then public blockchains are well worth exploring. For more on this Adam Ludwin of Chain explains it better than anyone in this post.","Okay, so it’s more secure, but nobody cares about security…","So the question becomes: how important is security to individuals, corporates and Governments, right? The bull case for blockchains is that it matters a lot and it will matter more in the future. If security continues to be an afterthought, well existing databases are cheaper, faster and more convenient, so why bother with blockchains at all?","Well, I tend to believe that security will become more important. Things like the Yahoo! or Equifax hacks certainly shine a light on the vulnerability of centralised data providers but tbh I really don’t think individuals are going to demand change. People are going mad for Amazon Echos and Dots and sticking them in every room, very few people are asking: what data is actually being collected? Where is it being stored? Is it encrypted? How can it be combined with other datasets? Security and data protection matters far more to business and to Government and the so-called Internet of Things will force the change.","Blockchains will actually help manage the sharing of data instead of fighting over it…","Never has so much data been available for collection and analysis. Connected cars are throwing off vast amounts of data, the challenge is that every single stakeholder wants access for their own purposes: car makers want it to improve the driving experience; tire makers want it to see how their tires perform; City administrations want it for traffic prediction; and software makers want it to improve their self-driving software. As sensors are embedded in all sorts of everyday objects, everybody is fighting for who ‘owns’ the data. This is fighting yesterday’s war. Blockchains can provide an open, shared data layer in which all stakeholders have access to data.","So blockchains will actually be quite useful in securing and sharing data…","Sure, not every bit of data will need a fully decentralised blockchain with proof-of-work. In most cases a simple distributed ledger with a Merkle tree will suffice (see DeepMind Health Verifiable Data Audit). Much of the data could even be stored off-chain with just links to the on-chain hash. Regardless of the blockchain flavour, cryptographically-secured distributed ledgers offer a better alternative than centralised databases. Of course, an assumption here is that blockchains don’t suffer the familiar fate of incompatibility by competing blockchains. The community does seem to be fully behind blockchain-connecting projects like Polkadot, Cosmos, Atomic Swap and AION. These services combined with zero-knowledge proofs mean data can be shared privately on public ledgers. At this point, we are close to the ideal of a globally shared database with easy and, ideally, public permissions.","Add in data exchanges…","Now, the final piece. Data exchanges like the Ocean Protocol bring together data buyers and sellers (also including bots and devices). As explained, today data is either given away for free or sits underutilised because people and organisations have no way to monetise it. A blockchain-based data exchange can enforce data quality standards, ownership and usage rules, and pay sellers to rent or sell data. A data exchange provides the missing component to a shared ledger: a business model. People and organisations can easily earn money from their data.","Now we have the infrastructure to share and monetise data…","Sure, people won’t just stop using Google or Facebook tomorrow. The value they provide is far too great. But these new networks will change the conversation. The public will begin reading news stories about how they can be paid when people download their pictures or paid when they upload their smart watch data.","The seed of disruption has been planted.

As a result of the backlash that followed the revelations the political consulting company at the centre of the scandal, Cambridge Analytica, has been shut down, as has its parent company SCL Group. Here’s an overview of the companies and people involved, and what they’re alleged to have done.","Which company is which","Canadian data analyst Chris Wylie has worked for or co-founded several firms whose clients included major players in the 2016 U.S. election, the Brexit referendum and Canadian politics. Then, Mr. Wylie became a whistle-blower alleging impropriety in how some of those companies handled data gathered from Facebook.","Cambridge Analytica: A political data analytics firm co-founded by Mr. Wylie, who left the company four years ago. It specializes in mining large amounts of consumer data for behavioural trends that political organizations can use for targeted marketing. Cambridge Analytica harvested millions of people’s Facebook data without authorization in 2014, according to reports earlier this month in The New York Times and Britain’s Observer, a sister paper to the Guardian newspaper. Mr. Wylie’s initial estimate was that 50 million people’s data had been collected, but later, Facebook’s own figures showed an even higher number: 87 million Facebook users worldwide (including, as it turned out, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg), including some 622,000 Canadians. Cambridge Analytica’s partners and patrons included Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit campaign organization. In 2016, Cambridge Analytica would also end up doing political work for future U.S. President Donald Trump’s general election campaign. On May 2, news broke that Cambridge Analytica is shutting down, a decision that was reportedly taken because the company was losing clients and faced rising legal fees over the Facebook investigation.","Story continues below advertisement","AggregateIQ: A B.C.-based consultancy firm that Mr. Wylie helped to create, and which he says created Ripon, the program used by Cambridge Analytica to target Republican voters in the United States. AIQ is under official scrutiny in Britain for its role in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Mr. Wylie and another whistle-blower, former Vote Leave volunteer Shahmir Sanni, allege that AIQ wrongfully received campaign funds from the anti-EU side in the referendum, while a group of British lawyers released documents purporting to show that AIQ participated in a plan to break election laws. AIQ has denied any wrongdoing.","SCL Elections: The parent company of Cambridge Analytica. In 2013, SCL was forging ties with U.S. hedge-fund tycoon Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah. This also brought them into a relationship with Steve Bannon, then a political adviser to the Mercers. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers were instrumental in bringing Mr. Trump to the presidency, the former as his campaign adviser and the latter as major donors. SCL Elections’ CEO, Alexander Nix, was also in charge of Cambridge Analytica, until the company suspended him. An undercover investigation by Britain’s Channel 4 appeared to show Mr. Nix and other Cambridge Analytica executives suggesting they could use bribes to help clients achieve their ends, or hire sex workers to put political opponents in compromising positions.","SCL Group: The British-based parent company of SCL Elections bills itself as an expert in helping businesses, intelligence services and the military use data to shape public behaviour. On May 2, SCL Group founder Nigel Oakes confirmed that it and its subsidiary, Cambridge Analytica, would be shuttered.","Eunoia Technologies: A data-analytics company founded by Mr. Wylie after he left Cambridge Analytica. In 2016, the firm had a $100,000 contract with the Liberal Research Bureau, a taxpayer-funded parliamentary office that supports Liberal MPs, for a pilot project having to do with social-media monitoring. This was one of many interactions between Parliament Hill and Mr. Wylie, who once worked for the Liberals.","March 20, 2018: Alexander Nix arrives at the offices of Cambridge Analytica in central London. Cambridge Analytica has suspended him as chief executive amid the revelations about its data-harvesting practices.","Henry Nicholls/REUTERS","What did Cambridge Analytica do?","How they got the data: Mr. Wylie and Cambridge Analytica formed a partnership in 2013 with Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University academic. Dr. Kogan developed a Facebook app for personality testing, dubbed “thisisyourdigitallife,” which some 270,000 people downloaded and used. But the app’s licensing agreement required users to give over personal information not only from their own Facebook profiles, but from those of Facebook friends with low privacy settings. Here’s how Mr. Wylie described it to the Observer:","What did they do with the data? Using algorithms derived from the Facebook information, AggregateIQ developed a program called Ripon, Mr. Wylie told a British parliamentary committee on March 27. Ripon, named after the Wisconsin town credited as the birthplace of the Republican Party, was designed to manage fundraising and voter databases, target specific voters and use surveys to gather more political data.","Was that legal? Facebook’s rules at the time allowed for research techniques like Mr. Kogan’s app, but didn’t allow data collected by such methods to be passed along to third parties, especially not for commercial purposes. Facebook says it learned in 2015 that the collected personal data was still out there, but instead of disclosing that, Facebook discreetly asked the parties to destroy the data, and believed them when they said they had done so. Cambridge Analytica, for its part, said it never collected the Facebook data itself, blaming Dr. Kogan for gathering the data improperly. Dr. Kogan has portrayed himself as a scapegoat in the affair, telling the BBC that Cambridge Analytica were the ones who drafted his app’s terms of service and that, as far as he knew, the data-collection methods were legitimate.","Story continues below advertisement","Story continues below advertisement","Had they tried anything like this before? The SCL-AIQ partnership wanted to try out their data-gathering tactics in Trinidad and Tobago in 2013, according to records obtained by The Globe. There, they planned to gather data in bulk from an internet service provider, hoping to create voters that would benefit a local political party. But it was unclear if AIQ or SCL actually collected the data.","The office of Cambridge Analytica is shown in central London on March 20, after it was announced that Britain's information commissioner is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's computer servers.","The whistle-blower","Mr. Wylie, the 28-year-old British Columbian who helped found Cambridge Analytica, has portrayed himself as an unlikely accomplice to the conservative schemes of Mr. Bannon and the Mercers. A gay vegan of liberal persuasion, he got interested in data’s potential to explain or predict elections when he was a student in London who worked for the Liberal Democrat party, according to the Observer’s profile of him. A party connection introduced Mr. Wylie to SCL, whose founder, Mr. Nix, gave him total freedom to pursue his ideas. But Mr. Wylie’s relationship with his employers soured as they got deeper into U.S. conservative politics: “Rules don’t matter for them,” he told the Times. “For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair. They want to fight a culture war in America.”","Mr. Wylie’s interest in politics and fighting injustice began at a young age, The Globe and Mail’s Patrick White reports. Growing up in Victoria, the six-year-old Mr. Wylie was attacked at elementary school by a fellow student, leading to a court battle and a settlement of $290,000. The young Mr. Wylie got involved in Victoria city hall, became a Liberal Party supporter and, in 2008, he went to work for a Liberal MP who knew his parents, Keith Martin. At 17, he worked for the federal Liberals under then-leader Stéphane Dion. A Liberal staffer told The Globe that he pressed the party to microtarget voters using data, but like the Liberal Democrats, they ignored him.","Speaking at a London journalism event on March 20, Mr. Wylie accused Facebook of ignoring him too when, after he left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, he tried to raise concerns with the California company about the harvested data. Facebook deleted him from the platform and associated sites, and he says Facebook is more concerned with blaming him than with fixing their own privacy issues:","Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist to President Donald Trump, speaks at a Republican Party dinner in 2017. Mr. Bannon was a major client of Cambridge Analytica.","The Associated Press","The big political questions","Did Cambridge Analytica influence the U.S. election? That’s unclear. Mr. Wylie has said he’s unsure how much the Trump campaign relied on Cambridge Analytica’s data. Mr. Trump’s campaign has denied using their data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee‘s information instead. Behind the scenes, Cambridge Analytica’s Mr. Nix has been much more confident of the firm’s impact on American politics: In the undercover Channel 4 investigation, he said the firm’s work played a decisive role in the 2016 election. But those comments could not be verified.","Did it influence the Brexit referendum in 2016? It’s unclear whether the data itself had a real impact, though Mr. Wylie and others allege that Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ served as proxies that helped the Leave campaign skirt financing rules. AggregateIQ co-founder Jeff Silvester denied that the company had “knowingly been involved in any illegal activity.”","Story continues below advertisement","Did it ever influence Canadian politics? Mr. Wylie’s ties to the federal Liberals have raised questions about what the party knew about his or SCL’s activities, but there has been no suggestion of impropriety or influence on the Canadian political process.","For the most part, it seems Liberal officials ignored (or at least didn’t adopt) Mr. Wylie’s ideas about Big Data. One exception was Ray Larson, an associate of Mr. Wylie’s and federal Liberal strategist in Victoria, who once described himself on his website as “head of operations for the SCL Group.” Then in 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Research Bureau awarded a $100,000 contract to Eunoia Technologies. In a statement, the bureau said the contract was for a pilot project that involved “acquiring and setting up social-media monitoring tools.”","Did it influence other elections? Cambridge Analytica executives told an undercover Channel 4 journalist that they had worked in more than 200 elections worldwide. AIQ’s involvement in the 2015 Nigerian election included the dissemination of graphic video content and “incredibly anti-Islamic and threatening messages,\" Mr. Wylie told British parliamentarians, adding that this was one of many dirty-tricks campaigns AIQ was involved in. SCL Group boasted about its success in using religious leaders to suppress voters in Nigeria, according to promotional brochures given by Mr. Wylie to the parliamentary committee.","What governments are doing","United States: Facebook has faced new calls for regulation from Congress and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards, but it is unclear whether or how the Republican-controlled legislature will act. Mr. Zuckerberg is testifying on April 10-11 before the Senate commerce and judiciary committees.","Elizabeth Denham, a former B.C. privacy commissioner, is now the British government's information watchdog. Her office is looking into Cambridge Analytica's role in the Brexit referendum.","DARRYL DYCK/THE CANADIAN PRESS","Britain: The U.K.’s Information Commissioner is investigating whether Facebook data was illegally acquired and used. “This is a complex and far reaching investigation for my office and any criminal or civil enforcement actions arising from it will be pursued vigorously,” commissioner Elizabeth Denham said, days before investigators from her office executed a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s London offices. Mr. Wylie and Mr. Nix have also testified before Parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.","Canada: Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien’s office is formally investigating Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica data, and Mr. Therrien said he would like to investigate AggregateIQ’s role as well. The House ethics committee voted to investigate the data leak and call on Mr. Wylie to testify, as well as executives from Facebook and other tech companies.","Europe: EU lawmakers will investigate whether the Facebook users’ data was misused, said Antonio Tajani, head of European Parliament.","April 10, 2018: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is surrounded by journalists as he arrives to testify before a joint hearing of the Senate judiciary and commerce committees on Capitol Hill in Washington.","LEAH MILLIS/Reuters","What Facebook is doing","Cleaning house: Facebook has suspended SCL and Cambridge Analytica from the platform, and hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to look into Cambridge Analytica. In a statement, vice-president Paul Grewal played down the idea that this was a privacy breach: “People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” Mr. Grewal also accused Dr. Kogan of having lied to Facebook and breached its privacy rules in his research activities.","Appealing to Congress: On April 10, Mr. Zuckerberg faced a nearly five-hour-long congressional hearing where U.S. lawmakers questioned him about his company’s data-collection practices. But while some politicians in the Republican-controlled legislature said they might pursue regulations against Facebook, there were few indications about how. Ahead of the hearing in Washington, Mr. Zuckerberg announced Facebook would set up an independent election research commission to look at the effects of social media on elections and democracy.","Improving privacy: On March 21, in his first public remarks on the scandal, Mr. Zuckerberg apologized for a “major breach of trust” at the social network, which spent the ensuing weeks rolling out new privacy measures, both to combat measures like those used by Cambridge Analytica and to comply with sweeping European Union privacy laws being introduced in May. These measures include:","Barring apps from collecting many personal details about users, including their political and religious views, relationship status, education and video-watching activity.","Requiring developers to get Facebook’s permission before accessing information about events, groups and pages posted on the platform.","Barring advertisers from targeting users based on information purchased from data brokers.","What’s next for Silicon Valley?","The Cambridge Analytica affair is only the latest scandal to put social-media tech companies under pressure for their political influence, especially in the 2016 U.S. election. U.S. authorities have uncovered evidence over the past year and a half that a St. Petersburg troll factory, the Internet Research Agency, tried to meddle in the election by creating political agitation groups and fake ads to inflame political tensions through social media. Thirteen Russians have been charged in the alleged plot by special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into ties between Russian nationals and the Trump campaign. The Russian meddling exposed major vulnerabilities in how Facebook’s algorithms can be exploited by foreign powers, and renewed calls for tighter regulation of the social-media giant. Mr. Zuckerberg made it his goal for 2018 to fix these problems and prevent future abuse.","Mr. Zuckerberg’s fellow tech gurus, facing blowback from their own users about how their personal information is used, have begun to openly support the idea of regulation. Speaking at a business forum in Beijing, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was “personally not a big fan of regulation,” but “well crafted” rules could be necessary to address the bigger problems.","What can I do?","For some Facebook users, Cambridge Analytica has been a wake-up call to curb or completely stop using the social-media service: The mayor of Mr. Wylie’s hometown, for instance, says she deleted her account. But issues of data privacy go far beyond Facebook, and short of complete abstinence from the internet, there’s no way to remove it from your life completely. But here are some useful steps:","Audit your Facebook apps: Go to the setting page and click on the Apps tab to see which services are connected to your account, and which permissions you granted them.","Check your privacy settings: If you're concerned about what your Facebook friends (and the apps they use) can know about you, review your settings and change them accordingly.","Install tracker blockers: Browser add-ons like Privacy Badger and Disconnect let you deactivate trackers installed on the website you visit.","Read terms of service carefully: Whenever you sign up for a new app or service, check to see what data it collects before you download or install it. If you do install it anyway, familiarize yourself with the privacy controls so you know where to go later in case you want to change them.","We have closed comments on this story for legal reasons or for abuse.

This is due in part to the fact that before the pilfered profile revelations, Cambridge Analytica enjoyed the praise of its peers in the marketing world, which viewed it as a band of innovators.","“The ARF is investigating the conditions surrounding the recognition we bestowed upon Cambridge Analytica. … We reserve the right to rescind the award.”","The ARF holds an annual awards ceremony named after David Ogilvy, the advertising luminary who pioneered the use of quantified consumer research and helped shift his industry to make data mining the norm (or the “best practice,” as the foundation might say). Winners of the 2017 Ogilvy Awards included Nike, Coors Light, and Cambridge Analytica, which took home the “Big Data Gold” prize for its pro-Donald Trump work. “The David Ogilvy Awards celebrates the awesome power of an irrefutable insight; the launch pad for any successful campaign,” wrote Jimmie Stone, chief creative officer at Edelman and a grand jury judge for the award, in a press release announcing the finalists. In Cambridge Analytica’s own preening press release, then-Senior Vice President Emily Cornell said it was “honored to be named a winner among some of the world’s most innovative companies and campaigns.”","Although it was subject to some critical coverage prior to the election, and while The Intercept reported many of its profile shenanigans a year ago, Cambridge Analytica was likely unknown to most U.S. voters before the broader news media, prompted by investigations this month in the New York Times and The Guardian, began asking hard questions about how the firm grabbed the Facebook data.","But the advertising industry was helping to normalize Cambridge Analytica for years. It’s unclear if that will change, even in the wake of a global scandal. In its year-old press release, the firm openly declared that it had succeeded in “identifying persuadable voters, discovering the issues that would drive their voting decisions,” and that it had “targeted undecided Democratic women voters after building models of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton support in ten swing states.” To its peers, Cambridge Analytica operated in full daylight.","The ARF told The Intercept that it was in the dark about how Cambridge Analytica was attaining those goals when it conferred the Ogilvy Award.","“At the time of the recognition, there was of course no way that the jury or the ARF could have had visibility or knowledge of the data collection activities that are now in question and that have just now come to light,” said ARF spokesperson Bill Daddi.","But even now that said activities have come to light, the ARF may do nothing. He added:","The ARF has a firm conviction that all behavior in advertising and marketing research must be conducted ethically and legally. The ARF is currently investigating the conditions surrounding the recognition that we bestowed upon Cambridge Analytica, and will do so in a deliberative and careful manner. We reserve the right to rescind the award should our investigation and subsequent revelations show that the level of ethical and legal conduct we require were not met in this instance.","But even while claiming the ARF has standards of “ethical and legal conduct,” the consortium won’t distance itself from the core of Cambridge Analytica’s business. When asked whether the ARF still endorses Cambridge Analytica’s general corporate practices of data mining and psychographic modeling, and to what specifically about Cambridge Analytica it objects to, Daddi replied that “the issue in question is not whether the ARF objects to Cambridge or any company. The consideration is that data may have been collected in a manner inconsistent with ARF’s guidelines for the award and not disclosed to them at the time the acknowledgement was made.”","In other words, had Cambridge Analytica acquired your Facebook data in a manner consistent with the social network’s fine print, there would be no scandal, so far as the ARF is concerned. When asked if the ARF would object to Cambridge Analytica’s practices had the Facebook data been acquired through a proper channel, Daddi did not comment.","Top photo: The logo of the strategic communication company Cambridge Analytica is seen on the screen of an iPhone on March 20, 2018.","We depend on the support of readers like you to help keep our nonprofit newsroom strong and independent.

We are launching an investigation,\" Maura Healey said on Twitter in a post that linked to a New York Times report on the issue.","The Times and London's Observer, which cited former Cambridge Analytica employees, associates and documents, said the data breach was one of the largest in the history of Facebook Inc.","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.- Christopher Wylie, whistleblower","Facebook on Friday said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica after finding data privacy policies had been violated.","The Observer said Cambridge Analytica used the data, taken without authorization in early 2014, to build a software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","The paper quoted Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, Canadian data analytics expert Christopher Wylie, who worked with an academic at Cambridge University to obtain the data, as saying the system could profile individual voters to target them with personalized political advertisements.","The more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential U.S. voters, at the time, the paper said.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,\" the Observer quoted Wylie as saying.","Cambridge Analytica still holds private data: NYTimes","The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.","The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through Kogan's company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers' Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the paper said.","It said Facebook's platform policy allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.","Facebook said on Friday it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and its parent group Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared.","A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said GSR \"was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the U.K. Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","Online political advertising 'Wild West'","\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" he said.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" the spokesperson said.","He added that \"no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement, which was attributed to the social network's deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal.","\"We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behaviour,\" Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims. In a Twitter post, Facebook's Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports \"important and powerful,\" but said it was \"incorrect to call this a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\"","\"We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,\" he said.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it \"provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.\"","Trump campaign manager declines comment","Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, declined to comment on Friday. In past interviews with Reuters, Parscale has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign, and that the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica.","Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was \"more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West\" and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements.","The suspension means Cambridge Analytica and SCL cannot buy ads on the world's largest social media network or administer pages belonging to clients, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, said in a Twitter post.","Related Stories","Popular Now","Comments","To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

He pushed for as much to be revealed as possible, a wish opposed by the company's legal and policy teams, who were concerned about the effects those revelations would have on the business.","Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. Early on in his Facebook career, Stamos reportedly faced dismay from COO Sheryl Sandberg over how proactive the platform should be policing itself.","With his departure on the table, Stamos has reportedly handed over his duties countering government-sponsored misinformation, according to Reuters. His 120-person team is down to three, redistributed to product and infrastructure.","In a tweet, Stamos didn't deny that reports that he was leaving, but said he is \"still fully engaged\" with his work, and later denied claims Facebook executives discouraged the security team from investigating Russian interference.","Despite the rumors, I'm still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.","It's worth noting that according to the Times report, Stamos was encouraged by Facebook's communications team to tweet in defence of the company as news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke — but only after every word had been approved.","Stamos, whose original staff of 120 people has been whittled down to 3 people, is now having his tweets dictated to him by comms staff.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings. Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them.","Wednesday’s announcement follows revelations that a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn’t given explicit consent to sharing. In addition, Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices.","Facebook’s chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for “some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.”","Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details.","The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people. For example, Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page.","Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls. Now, Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place. Facebook says it is also adding “clearer explanations” about how its privacy controls work.","Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer, called the new settings “the first of many steps” the company is taking to address privacy concerns.","Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25. The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data. They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents, no matter where it is based.","To comply with this, Facebook is adding a section called “access your information,” a secure way for users to manage data they’ve shared with the company, including status updates, comments and things they have searched for. That’s where people can go to delete information or download a copy. While this download was already possible, it took some time to figure out how to do it. Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail, without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past.","Cox said that while the changes are “in line with the principle of GDPR,” there’s also a “bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.”","Facebook also said it will propose updates to its terms of service in the coming weeks and update its privacy policy, but gave no further details.","(Copyright (c) 2018 The Associated Press.

Although there is a growing body of literature on online forms of participation, little research exists on the role of social buttons on Facebook (like, comment, and share) as tools of political voice. We use these native interactive features as indicators of how citizens engage with particular political messages. A content analysis of posts published on Obama’s official Facebook page over the two months leading up to Election Day was conducted, along with a detailed measurement of all user interactions for each post. Our analysis indicates that the Obama campaign used Facebook as a tool of top-down promotion, focusing on Obama’s personality and as a means of strategically guiding followers to act, rather than as a means of bottom-up empowerment or hybridized coproduction. However, we also found that followers engaged selectively with campaign messages and often interacted more with policy-oriented posts than with promotional ones.","Additional information","Author information","Roman Gerodimos","Roman Gerodimos, PhD, is Principal Lecturer in Global Current Affairs in the Media School at Bournemouth University.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S.

It also invited Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.","\"The hearing will broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,\" the committee's chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley, said in a statement. \"It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.\"","The three tech CEOs are expected to soon face a barrage of questions about their companies' data collection and privacy policies.","While Zuckerberg has expressed a willingness to testify before Congress, he has not formally accepted invitations from any of the three committees.","Citing Facebook sources, CNN reported on Tuesday that Zuckerberg had accepted that he will have to testify and would prepare accordingly.","Tech executives brace for a public spanking from lawmakers","\"At the highest level, this is what Congress does best: spank executives in public on behalf of their constituents,\" Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, told Business Insider in a phone interview on Monday. \"The problem is that usually, that's about all that happens.\"","Facebook will most likely need to reevaluate its messaging, which lawmakers have indicated has been less than satisfactory in Washington. Facebook recently sent officials to Capitol Hill to brief various committees, but those briefings were apparently not successful enough to prevent several official requests for Zuckerberg to testify.","\"Every time Facebook says, 'Well, no, you know, you signed up for that in your terms of service,' they think they're answering the mail, and what they're really doing is digging themselves a deeper hole,\" Rosenzweig said. \"So in terms of their public relations, they haven't found the right message yet.\"","And Zuckerberg, Dorsey, and Pichai are likely to be on the defensive about the prospect that the hearings could result in new legislation.","\"The main thing that Facebook and Twitter are going to try and avoid is some new form of regulation — some privacy protective regulation — that, for example, prohibits the resale of personal data without explicit consent to every such resale,\" Rosenzweig said.","\"So instead of just the terms of service, you could imagine a world in which Facebook has to say to me 'I want to give this information to Cambridge Analytica, is that OK?' 'I want to give this information to the Democratic National Committee, is that OK?' and whether or not that might happen.\"","Though it's less likely at the moment, one result of a rocky set of hearings from Zuckerberg and other tech executives could be the creation of a data-privacy commission like the European Union's.","The Federal Trade Commission confirmed on Monday that it was investigating Facebook — and one way Zuckerberg and other officials could pacify lawmakers would be to publicly commit to cooperation, according to Rosenzweig.","\"That's sort of how I would play it if I were them,\" he said. \"Not saying exactly what, but saying, 'We're going to listen to the FTC, and we'll do what they want.'\"","He added: \"I think their job right now is to lean as far forward as they can in being responsive. Otherwise, they're going to fall apart, I think.\"","Facebook embarks on a hiring spree in Washington","Facebook has 11 policy-related job postings on its careers website, signaling it's bulking up on lobbyists and public-policy professionals as it braces for perhaps its highest level of congressional scrutiny.","Facebook's openings include privacy and public-policy managers for emerging technologies and consumer products, as well as legal counsels for regulatory and political activity.","Having an arsenal of staff members in Washington could help ease tensions with lawmakers. But there is still a long road ahead for the social media giant to move beyond this scandal."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Various parties disagree about just how useful that data was, but Wylie claims that Facebook never told anyone the data was taken and that Cambridge Analytica refused to delete the data even after Facebook found out what had happened. Either way, 50 million people reportedly got screwed by Facebook and a pro-Trump consulting firm because the world is stupid and bad.","Anyway, having been publicly embarrassed by these ugly accusations, Facebook has decided to make sure it doesn’t happen again by banning Christopher Wylie. That’s sort of like taking a bank robber’s money sack away after they had already emptied it out and confessed to robbing a bank, except for the fact that Wylie personally having a Facebook page had literally nothing to do with any of this.

Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.

Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites.

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K.

{"originalurl":"https://anith.com/facebook-makes-its-privacy-data-downloading-and-deletion-settings-easier-to-find-techcrunch/","title":"Facebook makes its privacy, data downloading and deletion settings easier to find – TechCrunch – ANITH","text":["With Facebook facing a wave of public backlash over how it has handled user data over the years — a backlash that was kicked off two weeks ago with the revelation that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had worked on targeted election campaigns using personal and private Facebook data — the company today announced a new set of changes to help users find and change their privacy settings, as well as download and delete whatever data has been collected through Facebook’s network of social media services.","To be clear, many of these settings and features already existed in Facebook, but now Facebook is making them significantly clearer for the average user to find and use. It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe.","What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.)","We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front.","For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place:","User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now.","Privacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that.","Downloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.","The news comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week posting an acknowledgement of Facebook’s role in the scandal, and a pledge to improve the company’s practices with regards to third-party apps and how Facebook works with them, and what data it will provide in the future, which he also followed up with a full-page apology printed in several newspapers. It has not been enough for some, and #deletefacebook has become a trending concept, with the company’s stock taking a nosedive in the last two weeks."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

And there can be no doubt that the depths of depravity that the undercover reporters caught the Cambridge Analytica senior team boasting about in their operations around the world are indeed shocking. However, should we really be surprised to learn that companies of this nature are willing to go to such lengths?","In 2012 I was lucky enough to spend a month volunteering on the Barrack Obama re-election campaign. While there it was clear what the main focus was – get data, and lots of it. Under the campaign guidance of David Axelrod and Jim Messina in 2008, the Obama campaign was seen to revolutionise the way in which political campaigning was undertaken. It was all about big data. While registering voters there was a great emphasis placed on getting them to join a targeted sharing tool on Facebook.","Over a million Obama supporters signed up for the Facebook app during the campaign, an app which gave the campaign permission to look through their friends list, giving them a huge pool of rich data to mine.","We worked with the theory that potential swing voters were more likely to be persuaded by their friends than by generic political advertising, with the campaign promoting what they termed “friend-to-friend” communication. In swing states this was widely seen as very successful, although it’s difficult to know exactly what persuades voters.","It should be made absolutely clear that all of this data mining from Facebook in 2012 was done entirely with voters’ permission. In fact the purpose of the app was talked about at length with prospective voters, so there bears no comparison with this week’s scandal where data was taken from Facebook seemingly without people’s consent.","However, what is true is that both in 2008 and 2012 big data was one of the driving forces behind Barrack Obama winning and then returning to the White House. So fast forward six years, is it really a surprise that unscrupulous companies such as Cambridge Analyitca are taking these proven communications tactics and using them in an utterly nefarious way?","I hope that what we have seen this week will bring an end to many of the awful practices uncovered. Clearly, as someone who lives in Kenya, I share the wider curiosity about what all this might mean for our recent - highly unusual - elections. The alleged involvement of Cambridge Analytica’s in Kenya may now have new weight, given the recent revelations in the US and UK contexts.","Having said that, these revelations should not detract from the value that communications attached to big data can bring. As communications professionals, big data can provide us with real insight into our target audience that allows us to better understand what they really think, which in turn allows us to tailor our messages accordingly and answer the questions they want answering.","Take for example, one of the most traditional outputs of public relations professionals - a simple press release. A press release can contain three or maybe four key messages, and done properly these key messages will talk to a good segment of your target audience. But the reality is, no matter how well they are done, it is somewhat of a scatter gun approach. What if you could write a press release tailored for each individual you are targeting? That is the tantalising goal that big data can help us get closer to. Indeed, will big data make the humble press release superfluous in years to come as we use more targeted communications methods? I think it is entirely possible.","Data companies like Cambridge Analytica have probably been treading a thin line between legal and illegal, moral and immoral for a long time. Whether legal or not, it is unacceptable to use people’s information for purposes that they are not aware of. This latest scandal might just bring us closer to such companies being more transparent with the use of data.","Whatever the fall out of this debacle, it is important to remember that big data does not have to lead to cloak and dagger meetings, bribes and entrapment. Done in the right, ethical way, it is a tool vital for communications in the 21st century.","Zack King","Latest Insights","13th September 2018","AGRF 2018: Agriculture has a PR problem","“Africa’s innovators should be embarrassed.

He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.","“The was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time,” Zuckerberg said in the ads. “We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”","‘FUTURE REGULATION’","His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany’s justice minister said Facebook’s promises were not enough.","“In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,” Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.","Advertisers and users are also unhappy.","U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet’s YouTube for one week.","Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.","Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.","Reporting by David Shepardson; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Susan Thomas"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

What character on “Downton Abbey” would you be? What breed of dog is best for you? Some enormous percentage of Facebook’s 2.13 billion users must have seen Facebook friends sharing results of various online quizzes. They are sometimes annoying, senseless and a total waste of time. But they are irresistible. Besides, you’re only sharing the results with your family and friends. There’s nothing more innocent, right?","You are being psychographically profiled","Most people have heard of demographics – the term used by advertisers to slice up a market by age, gender, ethnicity and other variables to help them understand customers. In contrast, psychographics measure people’s personality, values, opinions, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. They help advertisers understand the way you act and who you are.","Historically, psychographic data were much harder to collect and act on than demographics. Today, Facebook is the world’s largest treasure trove of this data. Every day billions of people give the company huge amounts of information about their lives and dreams.","This isn’t a problem when the data are used ethically – like when a company shows you an ad for a pair of sunglasses you recently searched for.","However, it matters a lot when the data are used maliciously – segmenting society into disconnected echo chambers, and custom-crafting misleading messages to manipulate individuals’ opinions and actions.","In 2015, Facebook gave permission to academic researcher Aleksandr Kogan to develop a quiz of his own. Like other quizzes, his was able to capture all of your public information, including name, profile picture, age, gender and birthday; everything you’ve ever posted on your timeline; your entire friends list; all of your photos and the photos you’re tagged in; education history; hometown and current city; everything you’ve ever liked; and information about the device you’re using including your web browser and preferred language.","Kogan shared the data he collected with Cambridge Analytica, which was against Facebook policy – but apparently the company rarely enforced its rules.","Going shopping for impressionable users","Analyzing these data, Cambridge Analytica determined topics that would intrigue users, what kind of political messaging users were susceptible to, how to frame the messages, the content and tone that would motivate users, and how to get them to share it with others. It compiled a shopping list of traits that could be predicted about voters.","This is how Facebook users’ relationships with family and friends are being exploited for monetary profit, and for political gain.","Knowingly putting users at risk","Facebook could have done more to protect users.","The company encouraged developers to build apps for its platform. In return, the apps had access to vast amounts of user data – supposedly subject to those rules that were rarely enforced. But Facebook collected 30 percent of payments made through the apps, so its business interest made it want more apps, doing more things.","People who didn’t fill out quizzes were vulnerable, too. Facebook allowed companies like Cambridge Analytica to collect personal data of friends of quiz takers, without their knowledge or consent. Tens of millions of people’s data were harvested – and many more Facebook users could have been affected by other apps.","Changing culture and politics","That’s exactly what Facebook enabled Cambridge Analytica to do. In 2017, the company’s CEO boasted publicly that it was “able to use data to identify … very large quantities of persuadable voters … that could be influenced to vote for the Trump campaign.”","A healthy dose of skepticism","U.S. history is filled with stories of people sharing their thoughts in the public square. If interested, a passerby could come and listen, sharing in the experience of the narrative.","By combining psychographic profiling, analysis of big data and ad micro-targeting, public discourse in the U.S. has entered a new era. What used to be a public exchange of information and democratic dialogue is now a customized whisper campaign: Groups both ethical and malicious can divide Americans, whispering into the ear of each and every user, nudging them based on their fears and encouraging them to whisper to others who share those fears.","A Cambridge Analytica executive explained: “There are two fundamental human drivers … hopes and fears … and many of those are unspoken and even unconscious. You didn’t know that was a fear until you saw something that evoked that reaction from you. Our job is … to understand those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it’s all about emotion.”","The information that you shared on Facebook exposed your hopes and fears. That innocent-looking Facebook quiz isn’t so innocent.","The problem isn’t that this psychographic data were exploited at a massive scale. It’s that platforms like Facebook enable people’s data to be used in ways that take power away from voters and give it to data-analyzing campaigners.","Infographics show the classes and anxieties in the supposedly classless U.S. economy.","For those of us who follow politics, we’re used to commentators referring to the President’s low approval rating as a surprise given the U.S.'s “booming” economy. This seeming disconnect, however, should really prompt us to reconsider the measurements by which we assess the health of an economy. With a robust U.S. stock market and GDP and low unemployment figures, it’s easy to see why some think all is well. But looking at real U.S. wages, which have remained stagnant—and have, thus, in effect gone down given rising costs from inflation—a very different picture emerges. For the 1%, the economy is booming. For the rest of us, it’s hard to even know where we stand. A recent study by Porch (a home-improvement company) of blue-collar vs. white-collar workers shows how traditional categories are becoming less distinct—the study references \"new-collar\" workers, who require technical certifications but not college degrees. And a set of recent infographics from CreditLoan capturing the thoughts of America’s middle class as defined by the Pew Research Center shows how confused we are."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

But what Facebook didn’t say may be more important: The number of people affected by this aggressive form of data grabbing likely numbered in the tens of millions.","The reason concerns the nature of how Facebook handled its users’ data before rising privacy concerns prompted it to tighten its policies against what critics have called an egregious kind of abuse — allowing app developers to gain access to information not only on their customers but also on their customers’ many Facebook friends.","This technique, once widely used but now severely restricted, meant that officials affiliated with the voter profiling firm, Cambridge Analytica, could gain access to basic demographics and the Facebook “likes” of all of the friends of the 270,000 people who downloaded an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” If the people who downloaded the app averaged 200 “friends” each, that could lead to the collection of data on more than 50 million Facebook users.","That, as it turns out, is the number reported by a New York Times story on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica published Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the collection and use of the data. Facebook declined to confirm this number but also did not dispute it.","Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has reportedly requested documents from Cambridge Analytica for its investigation. The revelation underscores the power of social media networks and the unexpected ways in which technology companies can use data that users voluntarily give up. It also gives further hints to the important role big data plays in modern politics.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement in response to the stories on Facebook and Cambridge Analytics. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Facebook’s announcement on Friday focused on how people affiliated with Cambridge Analytica had violated policies of the social media platform. A Cambridge University professor, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, built the app that collected the user data. The app created by Kogan in 2014 offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","People who downloaded it gave Kogan consent to access information such as the city they set on their profile and the content they had expressed interested in by pressing the \"like\" button, as well as information about friend groups and contacts. Those who downloaded this and other app could have set their privacy settings in a way to block this access, but the default setting allowed this broad access to app developers.","Facebook said Kogan then broke its policies by passing the information he collected through his app to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015 and removed app. The company also demanded certifications that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan destroy information they had shared.","They certified to Facebook that they had done so, the company said, but it said on Friday that it had received recent reports that the data was not deleted. For violating its data use policies, Facebook suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook issued a statement Saturday underscoring that its policies now prevent a repeat of what Kogan and Cambridge Analytica did.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said: \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\"","It added: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"","Cambridge Analytica specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages and ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The answer rides on how transparent Facebook is actually being right now. CEO Mark Zuckerberg just put forth a statement and plan to improve data privacy, but omitted some of the most grievous inquiries — and stopped short of apologizing.","Exactly how Facebook handled the multi-year fiasco could be core to whether the public forgets and goes back to scrolling their News Feed, or whether users leave en masse while government regulators swoop in. With journalists around the world digging in and government officials calling for Zuckerberg to testify, the truth is likely to trickle out. Here’s what we want to know:","To what extent did Facebook vigorously investigate whether Cambridge Analytica had actually deleted all its Facebook user data back in 2015 when it made it promise to do so, and why didn’t it inform the public of the situation? (When did Zuckerberg find out?

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}
{"originalurl":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/data-misuse-bigger-than-facebook/556310/","title":"Facebook's Cambridge Analytica Scandal Is Part of a Bigger Problem - The Atlantic","text":["This Is So Much Bigger Than Facebook","After five days of silence, Mark Zuckerberg finally acknowledged the massive data compromise that allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain extensive psychographic information about 50 million Facebook users. His statement, which acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes in responding to the situation, wasn’t much of an apology—Zuckerberg and Facebook have repeatedly demonstrated they seem to have a hard time saying they’re sorry.","For me, Zuckerberg’s statement fell short in a very specific way: He’s treating the Cambridge Analytica breach as a bad-actor problem when it’s actually a known bug.","In the 17-months-long conversation Americans have been having about social media’s effects on democracy, two distinct sets of problems have emerged. The ones getting the most attention are bad-actor problems—where someone breaks the rules and manipulates a social-media system for their own nefarious ends. Macedonian teenagers create sensational and false content to profit from online ad sales. Disinformation experts plan rallies and counterrallies, calling Americans into the streets to scream at each other. Botnets amplify posts and hashtags, building the appearance of momentum behind online campaigns like #releasethememo. Such problems are the charismatic megafauna of social-media dysfunction. They’re fascinating to watch and fun to study—who wouldn’t be intrigued by the team of Russians in St. Petersburg who pretended to be Black Lives Matter activists and anti-Clinton fanatics in order to add chaos to the presidential election in the United States? Charismatic megafauna may be the things that attract all the attention—when really there are smaller organisms, some invisible to the naked eye, that can dramatically shift the health of an entire ecosystem.","Known bugs are the set of problems with social media that aren’t the result of Russian agents, enterprising Macedonians, or even Steve Bannon, but seem to simply come with the territory of building a social network. People are mean online, and bullying, harassment, and mob behavior make online spaces unusable for many people. People tend to get stuck in cocoons of unchallenging, ideologically compatible information online, whether these are “filter bubbles\" created by algorithms, or simply echo chambers built through homophily and people’s friendships with “birds of a feather.” Conspiracy theories thrive online, and searching for information can quickly lead to extreme and disturbing content.","The Cambridge Analytica breach is a known bug in two senses. Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University researcher who built a quiz to collect data on tens of millions of people, didn’t break into Facebook’s servers and steal data. He used the Facebook Graph API, which until April 2015 allowed people to build apps that harvested data both from people who chose to use the app, and from their Facebook friends. As the media scholar Jonathan Albright put it, “The ability to obtain unusually rich info about users’ friends—is due to the design and functionality of Facebook’s Graph API. Importantly, the vast majority of problems that have arisen as a result of this integration were meant to be ‘features, not bugs.’”","In his non-apology, Zuckerberg claimed Facebook had already taken the most “important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people’s information.” But changing the API Kogan used to collect this data is only a small part of a much bigger story.","To be clear, I believe Kogan acted unethically in allegedly collecting this data in the first place, and that giving this data to Cambridge Analytica was an unforgivable breach of research ethics. But Kogan was able to do this because Facebook made it possible, not just for him, but for anyone building apps using the Graph API. When Kogan claims he’s being made a scapegoat by both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, he has a strong case: Selling data to Cambridge Analytica is wrong, sure, but Facebook knew that people like Kogan could access the data of millions of users. That’s precisely the functionality Facebook advertised to app developers.","Speaking with Laurie Segall on CNN this week, Zuckerberg emphasized that Facebook would investigate other app makers to see if anyone else was selling psychographic data they’ve collected through the Graph API. But Zuck didn’t mention that Facebook’s business model is based on collecting this demographic and psychographic information and selling the ability to target ads to people using this data about them.","This is a known bug not just for Facebook and other social networks, but for the vast majority of the contemporary web. Like Facebook, Google develops profiles of its users, with information from people’s private searches and tools like Gmail and office applications, to help advertisers target messages to them. As you read this article on The Atlantic, roughly three dozen ad trackers are watching you, adding your interest in this story to profiles they maintain on your online behavior. (If you want to know more about who’s watching you, download Ghostery, a browser extension that tracks and can block these “third-party” trackers.) The Atlantic is not unusual. Most ad-supported websites track their users, as part of agreements that seek to make their ad inventory more valuable.","I’ve referred to this bargain, in which people get content and services for free in exchange for having persuasive messages psychographically targeted to them, as the “original sin” of the internet. It’s a dangerous and socially corrosive business model that puts internet users under constant surveillance and continually pulls our attention from the tasks we want to do online toward the people paying to hijack our attention. It’s a terrible model that survives only because we haven’t found another way to reliably support most internet content and services—including getting individuals to pay for the things they claim to value.","We become aware of how uncomfortable this model is when Steve Bannon and Cambridge Analytica develop personality profiles of us so they can tailor persuasive messages to our specific personal quirks, but that’s exactly what any competent advertiser is doing, every day, on nearly every site online. If that makes you feel uncomfortable: Good, it should. But the problem is way bigger than Facebook. This is a known bug not just with social networks, but with the contemporary, ad-supported web as a whole.","It’s relatively easy for social networks to address bad-actor problems. For the most part, social networks would be better off without bots artificially promoting posts or fabricated news capturing clicks. Platform interests are aligned with society’s interests as a whole in fighting bad actors.","It’s different with known bugs.","When platforms address them, they run the risk of breaking their business models. It’s hard for YouTube to fix a recommendation engine that leads us toward conspiracy-theory videos without breaking a system that encourages us to surf from one popular video to the next, racking up ad views in the process. It’s hard—though not impossible—to fix harassment and bullying on Twitter when many of Twitter’s most engaged users are opinionated and sharp-tongued and their arguments are some of the most compelling content on the service. And it’s impossible for Facebook to protect us from manipulative advertising targeted to our psychographic profile when their business model is built on selling this particular form of persuasion.","Platforms won’t fix known bugs on their own, not without external pressure. In his interview with Segall, Zuckerberg acknowledged that it might be time for regulation of Facebook, suggesting standards that force transparency around who’s paying for ads. We should push Facebook, and the web as a whole, to do much more to address this known bug, and others.","Users of the internet have been forced into a bargain they had no hand in negotiating: You get the services you want, and platforms get the data they need. We need the right to opt out of this bargain, paying for services like Facebook or YouTube in exchange for verifiable assurances that our usage isn’t being tracked and that our behavioral data is not being sold. We need an ecosystem that encourages competitors to existing social-media platforms, which means ensuring a right to export data from existing social networks and new software that lets us experiment with new services while maintaining contacts on existing ones. We need to treat personally identifiable information less like a resource to be exploited and more like toxic waste, which must be carefully managed, as Maciej Ceglowski has proposed. This may require a digital EPA, as Franklin Foer, Paul Ford, and others have argued—a prospect that would be more appealing if the actual EPA wasn’t currently being gutted.","Critically, we need the scholars, philanthropists, and policy makers who’ve woken up to the problems of bad actors on the internet to pay attention to the known bugs as well. Addressing the effects of echo chambers, polarization, and psychographic persuasion may not be as sexy as unmasking Russian botnets, but the botnets are a merely a symptom of a much larger problem.","Tribalism, manipulation, and misinformation are well-established forces in American politics, all predating the web. But something fundamental has changed. Never before have we had the technological infrastructure to support the weaponization of emotion on a global scale. The people who built this infrastructure have a moral obligation to own up to what they’ve done. On some level, in some way, Zuckerberg must know that. “We have a responsibility to protect your data,” he said in his statement, “and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you.” Nor does he deserve our support if he and his peers don’t address the known bugs that are corroding democracy.","We want to hear what you think about this article.

{"originalurl":"https://thinkmoult.com/improving-human-rights-through-secure-messaging","title":"Improving human rights through secure messaging - thinkMoult","text":["Improving human rights through secure messaging","Earlier this year, I talked about how important digital privacy is (even if you don’t think it is). I talked about political oppression, and how raising the awareness of basic digital privacy largely benefits those who are politically oppressed. Using secure services increases the amount of infrastructure dedicated towards them and raises the standards of digital security worldwide. But before we talk about how we make the first steps, let’s remind ourselves why this is so important.","The map above shows the results of the 2018 Freedom in the World index, derived largely from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. At the time, it was signed without competition by all UN member states. Green is free, yellow is partly free, and red is not free. As of 2018, more than half the countries in the world have issues.","There are quite a few ways to slice and dice freedom index data, but the general trend since the 1970s can be seen in the graph above – showing the distribution of free countries over time. Generally, since the 1970s, we’ve improved a bit, but largely stalled in the past 20 years. More than half the world still seems to have some problems in regard to political and civil liberties, and a few are getting worse. Of course, the above data is a gross simplification, so if you’re interested in seeing more detailed and granular metrics I highly urge you to check other dimensions such as Our World In Data’s Human Rights graphs.","The good news is that we all use the internet, and by using it we shape how it grows, and that allows us to make an impact on human rights. The World Economic Forum illustrates the link between digital privacy and human rights in the quote below:","Digital rights are basically human rights in the internet era. The rights to online privacy and freedom of expression, for example, are really extensions of the equal and inalienable rights laid out in the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.","As a case study, Facebook bi-anually releases a report called the Global Government Requests report (see the 2017 Global Government Requests Report blog post). In the first half of 2017, it shows that there were roughly 79,000 government requests for data for 115,000 user accounts. That’s more than double what it was three years ago (35,000 user accounts). Every report sees an increase in the number of requests, easily growing more than 30% each year. Yikes! That’s some serious compounding privacy interest!","However, there are steps we can take to raise the basic levels of digital privacy online. By adopting these technologies, we increase the global average cost per capita of digital mass surveillance — and reduce its efficacy as a tool to control and oppress those in need.","Our online activity can largely be grouped into three categories, messaging, email, and web browsing. By changing a few habits in our day-to-day online activities, we can make a difference. In this article, we’ll concentrate on messaging.","We send messages all the time – SMSes, through Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Google Hangouts and so on. If you’re the statistically average user, you have 2 messaging apps, and they’re both on the chart below. The data comes from Statista, and I’ve rehashed it slightly.","(note: due to a formatting error, you will need to multiply the horizontal axis by 1,000. So Facebook’s numbers are over 2.5 billion!)","What you may not know is that big data on the internet is owned by a handful of companies, governed by a handful of countries. USA’s Facebook and China’s TenCent gathers more of your messages than probably everything else combined. These companies have little to no incentive to protect your data, actively create digital profiles of you, and are based in countries that have governments that are more than happy to ask for it to be disclosed. .","But don’t listen to me, listen to Amnesty International’s Encryption and Human Rights Report instead. Unless you’re using Facebook’s WhatsApp (which is the least bad), Amnesty International thinks you deserve a slap on the wrist. Worst of all messaging apps is China-based TenCent’s QQ and WeChat, which scores a 0 out of 100 in protecting human rights. It has no encryption specification, does not recognise threats to human rights, made no commitment to freedom of expression, actively detects and censors content, and does not refuse backdoor implementations. So, if you send money through WeChat (yes, WeChat has higher transaction volumes than PayPal), guess what? It’s public! We could go through the many examples of public data but I’ll let you read the publication yourself and judge.","So what makes Facebook’s WhatsApp the least bad? Well, for a start it has publicly stated there is no encryption backdoor – no built-in mechanism for sharing your data. It’s more transparent and tries to notify you if your data is being requested, and produces bi-annual reports that we saw above. But perhaps the most effective secret sauce — the gold-standard of digital humans rights protection — is that it supports end-to-end encryption. This means that the moment your message leaves your device, nothing can read it.","WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption isn’t it’s own invention. Like any robust cryptography standard, it is based off free and open-source software. Many years ago, defectors from Twitter started a collaborative effort called Open Whisper Systems and developed the Signal secure messaging system. Signal is not owned by any company or country, is open-source, and primarily funded by the Freedom of the Press foundation. For instance, if you want to tip off The Guardian, Signal is one of your options.","However despite WhatsApp’s best intentions in using the Signal system under the hood, its nature as a Facebook acquisition, organizational structure and some of its other technical decisions means that WhatsApp falls short of Signal’s encryption standards. In short, WhatsApp retains metadata about your contacts and messages, which may be used to infer information about you (much more than you might think!). Luckily, the small core team that built the Signal system also have their own app, which is completely privacy focused. It looks just like any other messaging app out there, and anyone can use it if they truly want to get top-notch security and privacy. Here’s a screenshot of it from the official Signal website. If you have an iPhone or Android, you can download it from the app store for free. It works on your computer with a computer app, and also works as a Signal command line app if you’re a terminal junkie.","In fact, the core Signal app is such an ideal state of privacy in the messaging world that apart from earning a special mention in the Amnesty International report, it also earned a 50 million USD investment from the co-founder of WhatsApp. Brian Acton, the co-founder of WhatsApp, was around when WhatsApp made the initial jump to use Signal as its system under the hood, and after he left Facebook and WhatsApp, donated to create the Signal Foundation – a non profit organisation to protect data privacy, transparency, and open-source development, which aligns with Acton’s personal beliefs.","If two people want a private conversation, electronic or not, they should be allowed to have it. – Brian Acton, WhatsApp co-founder","There’s still so much to talk about, but let’s stop here. I highly recommend that even if you do not fully understand the technical background behind encryption or the full extent of the humans rights impact, to take the first step and install Signal.","See you on the other side!","P.S. For the more technically inclined, you may instead be interested in setting up your own XMPP server that supports the OMEMO XEP. OMEMO is an implementation of the same cryptographic technique pioneered by the Signal protocol, and XMPP offers decentralised messaging, in contrast to Signal Messenger, which for all practical purposes is a centralised system (theoretically, it is possible for somebody to use the protocol and build in federation support).","I've been developing software for well over 10 years, work as an architect (not the computer kind, the regular sort), and am classically trained as a pianist. I try to do the right thing when I get the chance in my field, such as through contributing to open-source communities and promoting sustainable living.","2 Comments","The best way to return to privacy is to return to non-technological means of communication – like good old handwritten letters and post-cards, and also using typewritten documents where you can destroy the original if you wish. I think a lot of people are slowly realizing this. According to an article I read recently (I don’t remember the link) even some companies seem to be moving away from e-mail or online communication for security.","It seems that the best way to avoid getting your privacy violated is simply not putting your data on the cloud.","As true as it is that mass surveillance was not cost effective in the pre-internet era (you can’t hire half the public to spy on other people physically), the fact remains that the internet is here, and people are using it.","Getting encryption savvy is the way to go in the digital age. You really can’t beat PGP end-to-end encryption."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. Over the past year, many Americans have learned about a longtime adviser to Donald Trump named Roger Stone, but political insiders have known about Stone for decades. A colorful operative known for provocative statements, Stone has worked on countless campaigns and has been repeatedly accused of disinformation and dirty tricks, many of which he happily owns up to.","During the 2016 presidential campaign, Stone said he had communicated with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, which released hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta. Stone has been called to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, which is looking into Russian interference in the election. He's also just been named in an invasion of privacy lawsuit filed by two Democratic donors and a DNC staff member who say they were harmed by information released in the hacked emails.","Our guest today, Morgan Pehme, co-directed a documentary about Stone with Daniel DiMauro and Dylan Bank. They spent five years making the film, \"Get Me Roger Stone,\" which is available on Netflix. Morgan Pehme has worked as a filmmaker and a journalist and is now executive director of Effective New York, a watchdog group that focuses on state government in New York.","Well, Morgan Pehme, welcome to FRESH AIR. I thought we'd begin with a clip that's very early in the film. And it's kind of in two parts. One, we hear Roger Stone introducing himself in an interview that you did, and then there's a little bit of archival video from years earlier when he's kind of talking about what he does. So let's listen - Roger Stone.","(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"GET ME ROGER STONE\")","ROGER STONE: My name is Roger Stone, and I'm an agent provocateur.","(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)","STONE: Stone's rules are things that I have learned in life that I seek to pass on to others who may want to be in the same business that I'm in or actually any business because they're fully applicable. So for example, a Stone's rule - it is better to be infamous than never be famous at all - Stone's rule.","DAVIES: And that is the plain-spoken Roger Stone from the new film \"Get Me Roger Stone\" co-directed by our guest, Morgan Pehme. You know, this guy has been known to insiders as a bad boy of American politics for decades. One of the most amazing stories to me is he says his first use of disinformation in a political campaign came in grade school. Share that one with us.","MORGAN PEHME: Yeah, so Roger, when he was in grade school, was involved in a mock election in his school in Connecticut. And it was between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy for the presidency. Though Roger had always been kind of inclined toward the Republican Party, his parents were Catholic, and he thought that John F. Kennedy had much better hair than Richard Nixon. So he was inclined to support JFK.","And his idea to throw the race to JFK was to stand at the end of the cafeteria line and tell every child that walked past that Richard Nixon had intended to extend the school day to - the school week to Saturdays. And so in a landslide, JFK won the election, and Roger said that this was the first time that he had ever used disinformation. And of course he's never practiced it since then.","DAVIES: (Laughter) He found he had a gift. He reads Barry Goldwater's book - what is it? - \"Conscience Of A Conservative\"...","PEHME: That's right.","DAVIES: ...And embraces conservative ideology. And then, like, I guess when he's 19 or so, he's in college, and he ends up getting involved with Richard Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972, the one that led to the Watergate break-in and the scandal that ended Nixon's presidency - Nixon known for the - you know, as among the biggest dirty trickster in American political history. What role did Roger Stone play in the Nixon campaign?","PEHME: One of the things that's so extraordinary about Roger is that he is a true political prodigy. And I don't think there are that many of them in our politics. He was already involved in political campaigns when he was in his early teens. By the time he was in high school, he was electing grown men to office in New York and in Connecticut, and then they would call him in his dorm room when he was a freshman, and he would inform them how to vote on key issues.","Right from the outset, he had both had a gift for politics and a taste for power. And so when he joined the Nixon campaign at 19 years old, he wasn't coming in as some ruddy-faced intern. He was already respected by the people who saw that he had a gift inside of CREEP, which is the acronym for the president's re-election campaign.","DAVIES: Committee to Re-Elect the President, right - CREEP.","PEHME: That's correct, yes. I admit I guess they didn't embrace that acronym. But it has gone down in history as the acronym. Roger was not exactly a piker in the campaign, but he was still just a lower-level, dirty trickster. They sent him on some missions to undermine some of Nixon's opponents. And because he had engaged in these lower-level, dirty tricks, he ended up becoming the youngest person called before the Watergate grand jury.","And he was discussed in the testimony during the grand jury. And Roger says that, you know, he was pretty much just a low-level henchman. But afterwards, he was really branded with the infamy of having been involved in Watergate. And rather than try to run away from it, he embraced it, and he kind of - this gave him street cred so that he could move up in the party. And he used it as a springboard later on to become elected president of the National Young Republicans, which was really his first major stepping stone into the highest rungs of Republican politics.","DAVIES: So Roger Stone is a bit player in Richard Nixon's re-election campaign and in the dirty tricks that accompanied it - didn't have a personal relationship with Nixon. That did come later. Tell us about that.","PEHME: What's so fascinating about Roger was that he was drawn to Nixon after Nixon had left his office in disgrace, when he was - when Nixon was radioactive to the nation and a pariah. But Roger saw in Nixon a potential mentor. And he sought Nixon out. And at this point in Roger's career, he had already played an integral role in Ronald Reagan's election.","And so he ended up being a conduit between the Reagan White House and Nixon. Nixon was very eager to give advice to Reagan. Reagan understood Nixon's genius and was willing to receive these missives that were brought back and forth by Roger. And Roger also set up off-the-record dinners with Nixon and key members of the media.","One of Roger's gifts is cultivating the press. And so he would set up these meetings at Nixon's home in New Jersey that reporters could hear Nixon's opinions on the issues of the day. And Nixon, in turn, could kind of slip his view into the news cycle.","DAVIES: So Roger Stone - before he helped in Reagan's campaign in 1980, he ran and was elected chairman of the Young Republicans - the national chairman of the Young Republicans, right?","PEHME: That's correct. He really wanted to change the Republican Party into the party that it ended up becoming, which was one that was far more conservative, that was influenced by Goldwater principles, not this Eisenhower earnestness and a more moderate Rockefeller side. But he wanted to make it into the hard-line conservatives. His current wife says that when she first met Roger, he looked to her like a Nazi Hitler Youth and that he was this true believer in absolute conservative right-wing principles. And Roger even calls it his Aryan phase.","And so Roger wanted to graft his worldview onto the Young Republicans. There was dissension among the Young Republicans between the two factions - the more moderate one and Roger's conservative one. But interestingly enough, his campaign manager was Paul Manafort, who would obviously go on to be campaign chairman for Donald Trump and would become Roger's very close business partner and lifelong associate. And Manafort and Stone were able to take over the party and to drive their agenda through the National Young Republicans. And they ended up using Young Republicans as a vehicle to change the trajectory of the Republican Party for the grown-ups as well.","DAVIES: Yeah, and it was fascinating to learn that Stone and Paul Manafort's ties go back that far. How did they know each other?","PEHME: They met in Connecticut through Young Republicans. And they instantly recognized in each other their mutual genius. And they found the kind of the best and the best of their generation, among them Lee Atwater, who would end up becoming the person who made George H.W. Bush the president and Charlie Black, as well.","DAVIES: Morgan Pehme's new film \"Get Me Roger Stone\" is available on Netflix. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.","(SOUNDBITE OF MATT ULERY'S \"GAVE PROOF\")","DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with filmmaker Morgan Pehme. He co-directed a new documentary about the political consultant and adviser to Donald Trump, Roger Stone. It's called \"Get Me Roger Stone.\" And it's available on Netflix.","So Stone is a regional director for Reagan's successful election campaign in 1980. He's a really, you know, relatively important figure at this point. And after Reagan's election, he forms a lobbying firm with Paul Manafort and Charlie Black. It's - what is it - Black, Stone and Manafort? Black, Manafort and Stone, right?","PEHME: Black, Manafort and Stone, that's correct.","DAVIES: What did they do? What kind of lobbying did they do?","PEHME: Well...","DAVIES: Describe their approach, yeah.","PEHME: Initially the firm was Black, Manafort, Stone and Atwater, until Lee Atwater left the firm to work with H.W. Bush. But what was so unique about Black, Manafort and Stone was twofold. First, they were the first campaign consultants who decided that after they elected somebody, they would turn around and profit off of the successful candidates by lobbying them. Prior to Black, Manafort and Stone having this breakthrough of sorts, it was considered distasteful in Washington to be on both sides of the fence.","But Black, Manafort and Stone thought that was naive, and they decided to make the utmost of it. And they had a great person to do that in the form of Ronald Reagan, who they had just gotten into the White House. And so they immediately profited from the Reagan administration. The other thing that was unique about Black, Manafort and Stone was later on, they brought in a Democrat, a top Democratic strategist named Peter Kelly. And they became the first bipartisan firm in Washington on K Street, which enabled them to triangulate every campaign and every issue from every direction. So they would profit both from the Democratic perspective and from the Republican side. And so they were great innovators in making money on K Street.","And now, those practices are so commonplace that we - it's hard to imagine a time when everyone wasn't doing it. But Black, Manafort and Stone were the trailblazers in this transformation of lobbying. And we argue in our film that this was integral to the degradation of our politics and the cynicism that pervades Washington that is so distasteful to the American public.","DAVIES: Yeah, it's quaint to think that there was a time when political operatives, who helped people get elected, didn't trade on that access and those relationships to make money from special interest. It was two separate things back then. There were lobbyists, and there were political operatives.","PEHME: That's right. And certainly, the lobbying business hadn't exploded the way that it is now - just a multibillion dollar industry. And - but Black, Manafort and Stone, they really saw what were the weaknesses in this system. They saw how to exploit it. Earlier on, Charlie Black and Roger and - had gotten to really know each other by understanding a shortcoming of the campaign finance law.","In the wake of the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court decision Buckley v. Valeo, they understood that this opened the door for the creation of what we now know as super PACs, that you could contribute an unlimited amount of money to candidates as long as you didn't do so directly through the campaign, that you did it through an independent expenditure. And this opened up the floodgates for the tsunami of money in our politics. And so they - along with Terry Dolan, who was the head of this organization that was this first vehicle for independent expenditures called NCPAC, the National Conservative Political Action Committee, this - they really understood what were the vulnerabilities in our system. And they took advantage of them to maximum effect.","DAVIES: So this lobbying firm that they form, Black, Manafort and Stone, what kind of clients did they have?","PEHME: They - Black, Manafort and Stone had among the largest corporations in the country, people like Rupert Murdoch. They also were particularly well-known as the so-called Torturers' Lobby because they were willing to take on clients like a slew of third-world dictators - Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, Jonas Savimbi in Angola, Mobutu Sese Seko in the Republic of the Congo.","And they felt perfectly at ease taking on these clients because these dictators were all ostensibly fighting Communists and in line with the Republican, Reagan agenda of the time. And Charlie Black says in our film that if you want to give criticism to Congress that funded these dictators and the wars that they were waging, that they will take that criticism at Black, Manafort and Stone. But they were really doing something that was viewed - they viewed as patriotic at the time. And they are unabashed in having worked for these people with absolutely horrible human rights records.","DAVIES: So how did Roger Stone meet Donald Trump?","PEHME: Roger was introduced to Donald Trump through Roy Cohn, who was something of a mentor both to Stone and to Trump. Roy Cohn was an absolute...","DAVIES: Roy Cohn is a whole story in and of himself. Maybe you should...","PEHME: Certainly, I...","DAVIES: Some of our listeners know the name and others won't. Tell us about Roy Cohn.","PEHME: He was an absolutely despicable, infamous lawyer-fixer based in New York City who was - first came to prominence being involved in the McCarthy hearings, where he drove the red-baiting agenda to attack people who were allegedly Communists. And Roy Cohn was as tough as they came - absolutely, perhaps, gave rise to Stone's roles. He was a person who annihilated anyone who stood in his path and was willing to do anything to succeed, both for himself and for his clients.","And he was really drawn to Trump. There's an incredible bit of archive in our film back in the '80s where Cohn says that Donald Trump is as close to a genius as anyone in this country. And he saw in Trump, immediately, the possibilities of Trump's career, the trajectory that he could possibly have.","And he also saw in Roger a kindred soul, a mentee, and a person who could take Trump by the hand and guide him. And as - and that's why he connected them. And Roger instantly was drawn to Trump. They formed a fast friendship, a fast business connection. And Roger became Trump's lobbyist in Washington, in New York, and started working on his political - on his business affairs.","At the same time, though, he saw a real political possibility in Trump. And as early as 1987, he was already pushing Trump to run for the presidency.","DAVIES: Yeah, this is a fascinating piece of history in light of the events of the past two years. And I thought we'd listen to a clip here where Roger Stone is explaining kind of why he thinks Trump could be an effective politician.","(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"GET ME ROGER STONE\")","STONE: Fifteen seasons of \"The Apprentice\" not only makes him a smooth television performer, but think of the way he looked in that show - high-backed chair, perfectly lit, great makeup, great hair, decisive, making decisions, running the show. He looks presidential. Do you think voters, non-sophisticates, make a difference between entertainment and politics? Politics is show business for ugly people.","DAVIES: So that is Roger Stone explaining why he thinks Trump would be an effective presidential candidate and a little bit about his own view of politics. It's from the film \"Get Me Roger Stone,\" which is co-directed by our guest, Morgan Pehme. It is available on Netflix.","He talks about wanting to - looking for a horse to back in politics, Roger Stone does, and describes Trump as a great piece of political horse flesh. Is it just Trump's kind of innate abilities to communicate, or is there some political ideology or approach that he is connecting with too?","PEHME: Over the five and a half years that Dan DiMauro, Dylan Bank - my co-directors and I - followed Roger, he would always tell us about how Trump should run for the presidency and how Trump could succeed. And we thought that was ludicrous.","And the idea was - that Roger always said was - that Trump had the celebrity, that he could break through to a wide audience and that he could circumvent the media and have this megaphone to talk directly to the people, that Trump had cultivated the outsider image, that he could come in and he could shake up Washington, and that he had the businessman acumen that would give him the credential to come in and shake up what has become a dysfunctional system.","Roger articulated this back in 1987. And he subsequently laid the groundwork, through his deeds and misdeeds, for that to come to fruition. And so Roger, to his enormous credit, you know, went through 29 years or 28 years of people berating him and telling him how absolutely ridiculous it was that Trump could ever be the president. And ultimately, of course, Roger was completely vindicated.","DAVIES: Morgan Pehme co-directed the film \"Get Me Roger Stone\", which is available on Netflix. After a break, he'll tell us about the personal scandal that derailed Stone's career and why he's been called to testify before the Senate intelligence committee. Also, Justin Chang reviews the new film \"The War For The Planet Of The Apes.\" I'm Dave Davies. And this is FRESH AIR.","DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with Morgan Pehme, who co-directed a documentary about Roger Stone, the colorful political operative who's been accused of disinformation and dirty tricks for decades. The film \"Get Me Roger Stone\" is available on Netflix. Stone's a longtime adviser to Donald Trump and first tried to get him to run for president in the 1988 election.","In 1988, Trump flirts with running for president, decides not to. And Roger Stone, you know, has a career as a - I guess as sort of a somewhat conventional political consultant. He works for various campaigns. He was chairman of Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter's effort at a presidential bid in 1995 and '96 ends up with the Republican candidate Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. That was, you know, Bill Clinton running for re-election. And then something terrible happened to his career. Tell us about this.","PEHME: So Roger was a true Washington insider. He had been integral in Jack Kemp's campaign. He had tried to make Arlen Specter the president. And then he finds himself working for Bob Dole, who a close associate of Roger's says there couldn't have been a candidate that he would be less enthusiastic about running for the presidency. And again, Roger always wanted to have his hooks in whoever was the Republican nominee, so he ends up a national chairman of Dole's campaign. And shortly after the Dole campaign launches, the National Enquirer comes out with a story unmasking Roger and his wife as swingers. They were placing ads in swinger magazines looking for - particularly for - and this is a direct quote - \"well-hung men to join them\" and other couples. And they specifically noted that they didn't want any fatties.","And this is, you know, a great scandal. Roger is forced to resign from the Dole campaign. This forces Roger out of the mainstream of the Republican Party and has huge ripple effects both for Roger and subsequently for the country. But Roger also may have been dirty tricked in this scandal being unveiled through the National Enquirer because just a few weeks earlier, Dick Morris, who was a political consultant for the Clinton campaign, has his own sex scandal around toe sucking from prostitutes. And it seems less coincidental that Roger may have been unmasked as a swinger in retaliation for the Morris scandal and maybe to smooth that over, at least for there to be a tit-for-tat in the media so that both scandals would be left to the side.","DAVIES: He has a tattoo on his back. Tell us about this.","PEHME: Between Roger's shoulder blades he has a giant tattoo of Richard Nixon's face. And Roger gives different reasons for having this tattoo. Sometimes he says it's just to infuriate liberals, but what he says in our film is that Nixon for him represents resiliency, that Nixon again and again was knocked down in his career and yet he would rise from the ashes and be stronger than ever before. Roger sees this as his own story, that Roger - just like because of the swinger scandal, that a lot of people, that would have been the end of their career. Roger's been knocked down many times, but he always gets up from the mat and he keeps fighting. And that's one of the characteristics that Roger most prizes in himself.","DAVIES: In the film, you pay a visit to Stone's home in Florida. And I thought we'd just hear a little bit of Stone introducing you to his Florida home.","(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"GET ME ROGER STONE\")","STONE: Florida is a great place to live. It's a sunny place for shady people. Welcome to Casa del Stone. This is where I live with my wife, three cats and three dogs and my 91-year-old mother. Tough as nails. If you ever saw \"The Sopranos\" and you're familiar with Tony's mother, that's my mother. These guys are liberal filmmakers. They cannot be trusted. Come here, Sam. Sammy is - he's not well. He's been losing weight. We've been taking him back and forth to the vet. Come here, baby. Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. No kiss? No kiss? This is the designated smoking area, kind of a contemplative garden.","PEHME: What do you contemplate out here, Roger?","STONE: Political strategy and destroying my enemies.","DAVIES: And that is Roger Stone from the documentary \"Get Me Roger Stone,\" co-directed by our guest, Morgan Pehme. Well, a lot of Roger Stone in that clip. You know, one of the journalists in the film says he tries not to spend too much time around Stone because he's so charming, and he doesn't want to be charmed by him. Did you find him charming?","PEHME: You know, my co-directors, Dan and Dylan, and I, we very much enjoyed spending time with Roger. He is extremely well-read. He's thoughtful. He is a great raconteur. And when you see him with this family, he's rather delightful. His wife is a lovely person. He has a great relationship with his daughter and his grandchildren. But, you know, of course, that never blinded us to who Roger is and how his deeds have shaped our country in our opinion, you know, much for the worse. And - but, you know, one of the great experiences that we had over this five and a half years of making this film is that Dan and Dylan and I were compelled to spend a lot of time with people whose worldview was anathema to our own.","And I think that's very valuable, something that's lacking in - for most of us that, you know, whether if we're Democrats, we look at Republicans like they're on another planet and vice versa. But because we spent so much time with people on the absolute opposite side of the spectrum, it compelled us to see them more as people. And we wanted to show that Roger is not just this mustache-twirling villain, despicable person that, you know, people love to berate him on Twitter. And certainly, he writes things on Twitter that are utterly deserving of people's ire. But if you got to know Roger, he's not the person who is easy to hate in just a very personal or intimate setting.","DAVIES: Well, you know, in the clip we just heard, he's kidding with his mother about these liberal filmmakers. And then he's kissing his little dog. And then he says he's contemplating destroying his enemies. It's all there. The other thing that's striking about the interviews that you have with him are his clothes and his personal style. You want to just give us a taste of that?","PEHME: Yes. Roger dresses with what he calls sprezzatura. And he is - he's an incredible aficionado of fashion. His closet is endless suit after suit after suit. He's got a wall of ties. You know, Roger is a bodybuilding pot smoking dandy swinger, which is one of the reasons why we want to make a movie about him in the first place because we felt that even people who weren't interested in politics would be interested in watching a movie about this incredibly unique and eccentric character.","Some people say that Roger dresses like a Batman villain. And Roger uses his wardrobe to stand out. He says in our film that you have to be outrageous to get noticed. He uses that to great effect. And his over-the-top style makes sure that in any room all eyes go directly to Roger.","DAVIES: Yeah. There's one scene where you're interviewing him. It looks like it's on a rooftop. And he's wearing this three-piece suit, this gorgeous coat draped over shoulders and pulls out a huge cigar, lights it up and then pontificates. It's quite a picture. I read that he threatened harm to you if he didn't like how the film came out. I don't know if this was true. It was good-natured. Tell us the story.","PEHME: Many times, Roger would say to us that he hoped that the movie would end with a montage of all the times he threatened to kill me and Dan and Dylan if he didn't like how the film turned out. We didn't end up going that creative direction, but there were certainly ample material that we could have cut together something like that. And we think that he made these threats only half-jokingly.","We were certainly aware of the fact that Roger has a long track record of destroying people that he doesn't like and that he could turn his venom on us. But at the same time, he used it to endear himself in a bizarre way to us. And we're relieved that we are all still on the planet and Roger hasn't gone through with his threats. And he has told journalists that he thinks our movie is both a masterpiece and a triumph. We're not sure exactly what to make of that, but we are relieved that we can come home to our families.","DAVIES: Morgan Pehme's new film \"Get Me Roger Stone\" is available on Netflix. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.","(SOUNDBITE OF RATATAT'S \"TACOBEL CANNON\")","DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with filmmaker Morgan Pehme. He co-directed a new documentary about the political consultant and adviser to Donald Trump, Roger Stone. It's called \"Get Me Roger Stone,\" and it's available on Netflix. When you started speaking to Roger Stone years ago, he was kind of a marginal figure in American politics, known to insiders. And then this long-held dream that Donald Trump would wage a credible presidential campaign happens. What do we know of Stone's role in getting the Trump for president campaign going?","PEHME: Well, we thought that Roger's life would be a unique lens to give a retrospective look at the last 40 years of Republican politics and how the party had changed and metastasized into the form that it is now. But Roger was always pushing this idea of running for the presidency. He really tried in 2012 to get Trump to run. And Trump came very close, according to Roger. But after the '12 cycle, Trump thought about it more and more.","And then Roger led a three-man team with Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and one of Stone's own proteges, Sam Nunberg, that laid the groundwork for the Trump campaign. And that was an operation that went for about a year and a half before Trump formally announced his campaign. It had a lot to do with cultivating the Tea Party across the country, getting Trump to have more of a national presence with the grassroots. And it was, you know, this kind of shadowy, exploratory committee that Roger led. And so from day one, Roger was at the helm of the Trump campaign. And once it formally announced, he continued to be kind of the chief strategist for the campaign.","DAVIES: So he - Trump launches his campaign, and Stone is there as an adviser in some respect. And then at some point in the summer, he departs from a campaign. What happened?","PEHME: Well, Roger claims that he quit the campaign. Trump claims that he fired him. You know, it's unclear what happened. Neither Trump, nor Roger have a great track record of truth-telling. So it's hard to discern what actually transpired. What I think it was was a clashing of egos. And when Trump was - even though Trump had surged to the top of the polls, a lot of the limelight was on Roger. I remember that Dan and Dylan and I had seen the cover story about Trump in Newsweek. And when we opened up the story, there was just Roger's name everywhere. And we were like, wow, Roger's going to get fired because nobody could take the limelight from Trump. You know, it had to be the Trump show. And it was too much the Roger show.","And shortly after that article came out, Roger was in some way ousted from the campaign. But because he was formally ousted from the campaign, that didn't mean that he didn't continue to have extraordinary influence with Trump. What's so amazing about Trump is what a small nucleus of advisers he has, that although he's had this multinational humongous corporation for years, he really just has a small orbit of advisers. And Roger is one of the people that Trump trusts the most.","And Roger, you know - of all the people that we met who knew Trump over the years, only Roger and Paul Manafort would call Trump Donald as opposed to Mr. Trump. And that spoke to the intimacy of their relationship. And so, you know, Trump knows that Roger will always give him an unvarnished opinion. Roger is an avid memo writer. And he writes these memos to Trump in, I think, in big font, in bullet points. He keeps them to one page. He knows how to communicate with Trump in vocabulary and in a message that Trump will understand and take to heart. And so I believe that Roger is and will always be indispensable to Donald Trump.","DAVIES: So what did Stone do for the Trump campaign? Do we know?","PEHME: We don't know exactly what Roger did with the campaign, but we do know that he gets his - a firm foothold back in it when Paul Manafort takes over as the campaign chairman from Corey Lewandowski. Obviously, Paul Manafort is one of Roger's oldest friends, one of his oldest associates. And as he says with glee in our movie when Manafort takes the reins - a journalist who knows Roger well says that Roger's back in the saddle. And so Roger certainly had very important influence in the campaign throughout when we were with him at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Roger was very much the belle of the ball.","And so for the rest of the campaign, Roger is clearly influencing the course, but to what degree he's, you know, making day-to-day decisions is unclear. But what is absolutely manifest is that Roger's opinion is valued and that he is having input in how things are unfolding.","DAVIES: OK, now Roger Stone is of interest to investigators who are looking into the connections between the Trump campaign and Russian nationals. He's scheduled to testify, I believe, before the Senate intelligence committee. What do we know about what Stone did or said he did or may have done with respect to things like leaked emails regarding the Democratic National Committee?","PEHME: Well, my co-directors and I know that Roger was trying to get in touch with Julian Assange from WikiLeaks. But we can't say for certain that he ever connected with him. And there's a lot - have been said that Roger prognosticated things to come through his tweets, that he said that Podesta - John Podesta from the Clinton campaign - his time would soon be in the barrel. And then, subsequently, Podesta's emails were released.","But Roger also put out a lot of tweets that were proven to be erroneous. So, you know, it's unclear to what degree Roger was just putting out stuff and seeing what would stick so that he could subsequently claim credit for foresight, or whether he really had advanced knowledge, through Assange or any other party, of how there was going to be meddling in the election.","DAVIES: Why did you want to make this film?","PEHME: You know, when Dan, and Dylan and I first found out about Roger Stone, we thought that his life was an extraordinary lens to talk about how our politics has transformed since Watergate and that we could trace the degradation of our politics through Roger's deeds and misdeeds. And Roger is such an incredibly colorful, over-the-top character that we felt that he could draw in people who weren't even interested in politics to hear a story that was enormously important in understanding our politics.","That's what got us on the trail with Roger, but we never would have expected that it would end with Roger at the apex of his extraordinary life and career, having completed his 29-year-old - what seemed like a quixotic quest to elect Donald Trump to the presidency.","DAVIES: There's an amazing moment in the film where, at the Republican convention, as Donald Trump finishes his speech, Roger Stone is in one of the booths and he is standing, giving the Nixon salute. Just connecting the thread.","PEHME: Yeah, Roger loves to give the Nixon victory fingers. He does so at most of his political appearances. I'm not sure for, you know, younger generations, whether that even has any resonance anymore.","But it's kind of Roger giving the finger to everybody who associates the Nixon fingers with what is the darkest and most embarrassing chapter of American politics. Roger embraces that and is only too happy to continue to use that iconography to his own effect.","DAVIES: Well, Morgan Pehme, it's been interesting. Thanks so much for speaking with us.","PEHME: Thank you so much, Dave.","DAVIES: Morgan Pehme co-directed the film \"Get Me Roger Stone\" with Dylan Bank and Daniel DiMauro. It's available on Netflix.

{"originalurl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage","title":"Robert Mercer: the big data billionaire waging war on mainstream media | Politics | The Guardian","text":["Robert Mercer in New York in 2014.\nPhotograph: DDP USA/Rex Shutterstock","This article is the subject of a legal complaint on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC and SCL Elections Limited.","Just over a week ago, Donald Trump gathered members of the world’s press before him and told them they were liars. “The press, honestly, is out of control,” he said. “The public doesn’t believe you any more.” CNN was described as “very fake news… story after story is bad”. The BBC was “another beauty”.","That night I did two things. First, I typed “Trump” in the search box of Twitter. My feed was reporting that he was crazy, a lunatic, a raving madman. But that wasn’t how it was playing out elsewhere. The results produced a stream of “Go Donald!!!!”, and “You show ’em!!!” There were star-spangled banner emojis and thumbs-up emojis and clips of Trump laying into the “FAKE news MSM liars!”","Trump had spoken, and his audience had heard him. Then I did what I’ve been doing for two and a half months now. I Googled “mainstream media is…” And there it was. Google’s autocomplete suggestions: “mainstream media is… dead, dying, fake news, fake, finished”. Is it dead, I wonder? Has FAKE news won? Are we now the FAKE news? Is the mainstream media – we, us, I – dying?","I click Google’s first suggested link. It leads to a website called CNSnews.com and an article: “The Mainstream media are dead.” They’re dead, I learn, because they – we, I – “cannot be trusted”. How had it, an obscure site I’d never heard of, dominated Google’s search algorithm on the topic? In the “About us” tab, I learn CNSnews is owned by the Media Research Center, which a click later I learn is “America’s media watchdog”, an organisation that claims an “unwavering commitment to neutralising leftwing bias in the news, media and popular culture”.","Another couple of clicks and I discover that it receives a large bulk of its funding – more than $10m in the past decade – from a single source, the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. If you follow US politics you may recognise the name. Robert Mercer is the money behind Donald Trump. But then, I will come to learn, Robert Mercer is the money behind an awful lot of things. He was Trump’s single biggest donor. Mercer started backing Ted Cruz, but when he fell out of the presidential race he threw his money – $13.5m of it – behind the Trump campaign.","It’s money he’s made as a result of his career as a brilliant but reclusive computer scientist. He started his career at IBM, where he made what the Association for Computational Linguistics called “revolutionary” breakthroughs in language processing – a science that went on to be key in developing today’s AI – and later became joint CEO of Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund that makes its money by using algorithms to model and trade on the financial markets.","One of its funds, Medallion, which manages only its employees’ money, is the most successful in the world – generating $55bn so far. And since 2010, Mercer has donated $45m to different political campaigns – all Republican – and another $50m to non-profits – all rightwing, ultra-conservative. This is a billionaire who is, as billionaires are wont, trying to reshape the world according to his personal beliefs.","Robert Mercer very rarely speaks in public and never to journalists, so to gauge his beliefs you have to look at where he channels his money: a series of yachts, all called Sea Owl; a $2.9m model train set; climate change denial (he funds a climate change denial thinktank, the Heartland Institute); and what is maybe the ultimate rich man’s plaything – the disruption of the mainstream media. In this he is helped by his close associate Steve Bannon, Trump’s campaign manager and now chief strategist. The money he gives to the Media Research Center, with its mission of correcting “liberal bias” is just one of his media plays. There are other bigger, and even more deliberate strategies, and shining brightly, the star at the centre of the Mercer media galaxy, is Breitbart.","It was $10m of Mercer’s money that enabled Bannon to fund Breitbart – a rightwing news site, set up with the express intention of being a Huffington Post for the right. It has launched the careers of Milo Yiannopoulos and his like, regularly hosts antisemitic and Islamophobic views, and is currently being boycotted by more than 1,000 brands after an activist campaign. It has been phenomenally successful: the 29th most popular site in America with 2bn page views a year. It’s bigger than its inspiration, the Huffington Post, bigger, even, than PornHub. It’s the biggest political site on Facebook. The biggest on Twitter.","Prominent rightwing journalist Andrew Breitbart, who founded the site but died in 2012, told Bannon that they had “to take back the culture”. And, arguably, they have, though American culture is only the start of it. In 2014, Bannon launched Breitbart London, telling the New York Times it was specifically timed ahead of the UK’s forthcoming election. It was, he said, the latest front “in our current cultural and political war”. France and Germany are next.","A determined plutocrat and a brilliant media strategist can, and have, found a way to mould journalism to their own ends","But there was another reason why I recognised Robert Mercer’s name: because of his connection to Cambridge Analytica, a small data analytics company. He is reported to have a $10m stake in the company, which was spun out of a bigger British company called SCL Group. It specialises in “election management strategies” and “messaging and information operations”, refined over 25 years in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. In military circles this is known as “psyops” – psychological operations. (Mass propaganda that works by acting on people’s emotions.)","Cambridge Analytica worked for the Trump campaign and, so I’d read, the Leave campaign. When Mercer supported Cruz, Cambridge Analytica worked with Cruz. When Robert Mercer started supporting Trump, Cambridge Analytica came too. And where Mercer’s money is, Steve Bannon is usually close by: it was reported that until recently he had a seat on the board.","Last December, I wrote about Cambridge Analytica in a piece about how Google’s search results on certain subjects were being dominated by rightwing and extremist sites. Jonathan Albright, a professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, who had mapped the news ecosystem and found millions of links between rightwing sites “strangling” the mainstream media, told me that trackers from sites like Breitbart could also be used by companies like Cambridge Analytica to follow people around the web and then, via Facebook, target them with ads.","On its website, Cambridge Analytica makes the astonishing boast that it has psychological profiles based on 5,000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters – its USP is to use this data to understand people’s deepest emotions and then target them accordingly. The system, according to Albright, amounted to a “propaganda machine”.","A few weeks later, the Observer received a letter. Cambridge Analytica was not employed by the Leave campaign, it said. Cambridge Analytica “is a US company based in the US. It hasn’t worked in British politics.”","Which is how, earlier this week, I ended up in a Pret a Manger near Westminster with Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s affable communications director, looking at snapshots of Donald Trump on his phone. It was Wigmore who orchestrated Nigel Farage’s trip to Trump Tower – the PR coup that saw him become the first foreign politician to meet the president elect.","Wigmore scrolls through the snaps on his phone. “That’s the one I took,” he says pointing at the now globally famous photo of Farage and Trump in front of his golden elevator door giving the thumbs-up sign. Wigmore was one of the “bad boys of Brexit” – a term coined by Arron Banks, the Bristol-based businessman who was Leave.EU’s co-founder.","Cambridge Analytica had worked for them, he said. It had taught them how to build profiles, how to target people and how to scoop up masses of data from people’s Facebook profiles. A video on YouTube shows one of Cambridge Analytica’s and SCL’s employees, Brittany Kaiser, sitting on the panel at Leave.EU’s launch event.","Facebook was the key to the entire campaign, Wigmore explained. A Facebook ‘like’, he said, was their most “potent weapon”. “Because using artificial intelligence, as we did, tells you all sorts of things about that individual and how to convince them with what sort of advert. And you knew there would also be other people in their network who liked what they liked, so you could spread. And then you follow them. The computer never stops learning and it never stops monitoring.”","“It is creepy! It’s really creepy! It’s why I’m not on Facebook! I tried it on myself to see what information it had on me and I was like, ‘Oh my God!’ What’s scary is that my kids had put things on Instagram and it picked that up. It knew where my kids went to school.”","They hadn’t “employed” Cambridge Analytica, he said. No money changed hands. “They were happy to help.”","Why?","“Because Nigel is a good friend of the Mercers. And Robert Mercer introduced them to us. He said, ‘Here’s this company we think may be useful to you.’ What they were trying to do in the US and what we were trying to do had massive parallels. We shared a lot of information. Why wouldn’t you?” Behind Trump’s campaign and Cambridge Analytica, he said, were “the same people. It’s the same family.”","There were already a lot of questions swirling around Cambridge Analytica, and Andy Wigmore has opened up a whole lot more. Such as: are you supposed to declare services-in-kind as some sort of donation? The Electoral Commission says yes, if it was more than £7,500. And was it declared? The Electoral Commission says no. Does that mean a foreign billionaire had possibly influenced the referendum without that influence being apparent? It’s certainly a question worth asking.","In the last month or so, articles in first the Swiss and the US press have asked exactly what Cambridge Analytica is doing with US voters’ data. In a statement to the Observer, the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “Any business collecting and using personal data in the UK must do so fairly and lawfully. We will be contacting Cambridge Analytica and asking questions to find out how the company is operating in the UK and whether the law is being followed.”","Cambridge Analytica said last Friday they are in touch with the ICO and are completely compliant with UK and EU data laws. It did not answer other questions the Observer put to it this week about how it built its psychometric model, which owes its origins to original research carried out by scientists at Cambridge University’s Psychometric Centre, research based on a personality quiz on Facebook that went viral. More than 6 million people ended up doing it, producing an astonishing treasure trove of data.","These Facebook profiles – especially people’s “likes” – could be correlated across millions of others to produce uncannily accurate results. Michal Kosinski, the centre’s lead scientist, found that with knowledge of 150 likes, their model could predict someone’s personality better than their spouse. With 300, it understood you better than yourself. “Computers see us in a more robust way than we see ourselves,” says Kosinski.","But there are strict ethical regulations regarding what you can do with this data. Did SCL Group have access to the university’s model or data, I ask Professor Jonathan Rust, the centre’s director? “Certainly not from us,” he says. “We have very strict rules around this.”","A scientist, Aleksandr Kogan, from the centre was contracted to build a model for SCL, and says he collected his own data. Professor Rust says he doesn’t know where Kogan’s data came from. “The evidence was contrary. I reported it.” An independent adjudicator was appointed by the university. “But then Kogan said he’d signed a non-disclosure agreement with SCL and he couldn’t continue [answering questions].”","Kogan disputes this and says SCL satisfied the university’s inquiries. But perhaps more than anyone, Professor Rust understands how the kind of information people freely give up to social media sites could be used.","Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is a friend of the Mercers. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images","“The danger of not having regulation around the sort of data you can get from Facebook and elsewhere is clear. With this, a computer can actually do psychology, it can predict and potentially control human behaviour. It’s what the scientologists try to do but much more powerful. It’s how you brainwash someone. It’s incredibly dangerous.","“It’s no exaggeration to say that minds can be changed. Behaviour can be predicted and controlled. I find it incredibly scary. I really do. Because nobody has really followed through on the possible consequences of all this. People don’t know it’s happening to them. Their attitudes are being changed behind their backs.”","Mercer invested in Cambridge Analytica, the Washington Post reported, “driven in part by an assessment that the right was lacking sophisticated technology capabilities”. But in many ways, it’s what Cambridge Analytica’s parent company does that raises even more questions.","Emma Briant, a propaganda specialist at the University of Sheffield, wrote about SCL Group in her 2015 book, Propaganda and Counter-Terrorism: Strategies for Global Change. Cambridge Analytica has the technological tools to effect behavioural and psychological change, she said, but it’s SCL that strategises it. It has specialised, at the highest level – for Nato, the MoD, the US state department and others – in changing the behaviour of large groups. It models mass populations and then it changes their beliefs.","SCL was founded by someone called Nigel Oakes, who worked for Saatchi & Saatchi on Margaret Thatcher’s image, says Briant, and the company had been “making money out of the propaganda side of the war on terrorism over a long period of time. There are different arms of SCL but it’s all about reach and the ability to shape the discourse. They are trying to amplify particular political narratives. And they are selective in who they go for: they are not doing this for the left.”","In the course of the US election, Cambridge Analytica amassed a database, as it claims on its website, of almost the entire US voting population – 220 million people – and the Washington Post reported last week that SCL was increasing staffing at its Washington office and competing for lucrative new contracts with Trump’s administration. “It seems significant that a company involved in engineering a political outcome profits from what follows. Particularly if it’s the manipulation, and then resolution, of fear,” says Briant.","It’s the database, and what may happen to it, that particularly exercises Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician and data activist who has been investigating Cambridge Analytica and SCL for more than a year. “How is it going to be used?” he says. “Is it going to be used to try and manipulate people around domestic policies? Or to ferment conflict between different communities? It is potentially very scary. People just don’t understand the power of this data and how it can be used against them.”","There are two things, potentially, going on simultaneously: the manipulation of information on a mass level, and the manipulation of information at a very individual level. Both based on the latest understandings in science about how people work, and enabled by technological platforms built to bring us together.","Are we living in a new era of propaganda, I ask Emma Briant? One we can’t see, and that is working on us in ways we can’t understand? Where we can only react, emotionally, to its messages? “Definitely. The way that surveillance through technology is so pervasive, the collection and use of our data is so much more sophisticated. It’s totally covert. And people don’t realise what is going on.”","Public mood and politics goes through cycles. You don’t have to subscribe to any conspiracy theory, Briant says, to see that a mass change in public sentiment is happening. Or that some of the tools in action are straight out of the military’s or SCL’s playbook.","But then there’s increasing evidence that our public arenas – the social media sites where we post our holiday snaps or make comments about the news – are a new battlefield where international geopolitics is playing out in real time. It’s a new age of propaganda. But whose? This week, Russia announced the formation of a new branch of the military: “information warfare troops”.","Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda institute tells me that one third of all traffic on Twitter before the EU referendum was automated “bots” – accounts that are programmed to look like people, to act like people, and to change the conversation, to make topics trend. And they were all for Leave. Before the US election, they were five-to-one in favour of Trump – many of them Russian. Last week they have been in action in the Stoke byelection – Russian bots, organised by who? – attacking Paul Nuttall.","You can take a trending topic, such as fake news, and then weaponise it, turn it against the media that uncovered it","There’s nothing accidental about Trump’s behaviour, Andy Wigmore tells me. “That press conference. It was absolutely brilliant. I could see exactly what he was doing. There’s feedback going on constantly. That’s what you can do with artificial intelligence. You can measure ever reaction to every word. He has a word room, where you fix key words. We did it. So with immigration, there are actually key words within that subject matter which people are concerned about. So when you are going to make a speech, it’s all about how can you use these trending words.”","Wigmore met with Trump’s team right at the start of the Leave campaign. “And they said the holy grail was artificial intelligence.”","Who did?","“Jared Kushner and Jason Miller.”","Later, when Trump picked up Mercer and Cambridge Analytica, the game changed again. “It’s all about the emotions. This is the big difference with what we did. They call it bio-psycho-social profiling. It takes your physical, mental and lifestyle attributes and works out how people work, how they react emotionally.”","Bio-psycho-social profiling, I read later, is one offensive in what is called “cognitive warfare”. Though there are many others: “recoding the mass consciousness to turn patriotism into collaborationism,” explains a Nato briefing document on countering Russian disinformation written by an SCL employee. “Time-sensitive professional use of media to propagate narratives,” says one US state department white paper. “Of particular importance to psyop personnel may be publicly and commercially available data from social media platforms.”","Yet another details the power of a “cognitive casualty” – a “moral shock” that “has a disabling effect on empathy and higher processes such as moral reasoning and critical thinking”. Something like immigration, perhaps. Or “fake news”. Or as it has now become: “FAKE news!!!!”","How do you change the way a nation thinks? You could start by creating a mainstream media to replace the existing one with a site such as Breitbart. You could set up other websites that displace mainstream sources of news and information with your own definitions of concepts like “liberal media bias”, like CNSnews.com. And you could give the rump mainstream media, papers like the “failing New York Times!” what it wants: stories. Because the third prong of Mercer and Bannon’s media empire is the Government Accountability Institute.","Bannon co-founded it with $2m of Mercer’s money. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, was appointed to the board. Then they invested in expensive, long-term investigative journalism. “The modern economics of the newsroom don’t support big investigative reporting staffs,” Bannon told Forbes magazine. “You wouldn’t get a Watergate, a Pentagon Papers today, because nobody can afford to let a reporter spend seven months on a story. We can. We’re working as a support function.”","Welcome to the future of journalism in the age of platform capitalism. News organisations have to do a better job of creating new financial models. But in the gaps in between, a determined plutocrat and a brilliant media strategist can, and have, found a way to mould journalism to their own ends.","In 2015, Steve Bannon described to Forbes how the GAI operated, employing a data scientist to trawl the dark web (in the article he boasts of having access to $1.3bn worth of supercomputers) to dig up the kind of source material Google can’t find. One result has been a New York Times bestseller, Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, written by GAI’s president, Peter Schweizer and later turned into a film produced by Rebekah Mercer and Steve Bannon.","This, Bannon explained, is how you “weaponise” the narrative you want. With hard researched facts. With those, you can launch it straight on to the front page of the New York Times, as the story of Hillary Clinton’s cash did. Like Hillary’s emails it turned the news agenda, and, most crucially, it diverted the attention of the news cycle. Another classic psyops approach. “Strategic drowning” of other messages.","This is a strategic, long-term and really quite brilliant play. In the 1990s, Bannon explained, conservative media couldn’t take Bill Clinton down because “they wound up talking to themselves in an echo chamber”.","As, it turns out, the liberal media is now. We are scattered, separate, squabbling among ourselves and being picked off like targets in a shooting gallery. Increasingly, there’s a sense that we are talking to ourselves. And whether it’s Mercer’s millions or other factors, Jonathan Albright’s map of the news and information ecosystem shows how rightwing sites are dominating sites like YouTube and Google, bound tightly together by millions of links.","Is there a central intelligence to that, I ask Albright? “There has to be. There has to be some type of coordination. You can see from looking at the map, from the architecture of the system, that this is not accidental. It’s clearly being led by money and politics.”","There’s been a lot of talk in the echo chamber about Bannon in the last few months, but it’s Mercer who provided the money to remake parts of the media landscape. And while Bannon understands the media, Mercer understands big data. He understands the structure of the internet. He knows how algorithms work.","Robert Mercer did not respond to a request for comment for this piece. Nick Patterson, a British cryptographer, who worked at Renaissance Technologies in the 80s and is now a computational geneticist at MIT, described to me how he was the one who talent-spotted Mercer. “There was an elite group working at IBM in the 1980s doing speech research, speech recognition, and when I joined Renaissance I judged that the mathematics we were trying to apply to financial markets were very similar.”","He describes Mercer as “very, very conservative. He truly did not like the Clintons. He thought Bill Clinton was a criminal. And his basic politics, I think, was that he’s a rightwing libertarian, he wants the government out of things.”","He suspects that Mercer is bringing the brilliant computational skills he brought to finance to bear on another very different sphere. “We make mathematical models of the financial markets which are probability models, and from those we try and make predictions. What I suspect Cambridge Analytica do is that they build probability models of how people vote. And then they look at what they can do to influence that.”","Finding the edge is what quants do. They build quantitative models that automate the process of buying and selling shares and then they chase tiny gaps in knowledge to create huge wins. Renaissance Technologies was one of the first hedge funds to invest in AI. But what it does with it, how it’s been programmed to do it, is completely unknown. It is, Bloomberg reports, the “blackest box in finance”.","Johan Bollen, associate professor at Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing, tells me how he discovered one possible edge: he’s done research that shows you can predict stock market moves from Twitter. You can measure public sentiment and then model it. “Society is driven by emotions, which it’s always been difficult to measure, collectively. But there are now programmes that can read text and measure it and give us a window into those collective emotions.”","The research caused a huge ripple among two different constituencies. “We had a lot attention from hedge funds. They are looking for signals everywhere and this is a hugely interesting signal. My impression is hedge funds do have these algorithms that are scanning social feeds. The flash crashes we’ve had – sudden huge drops in stock prices – indicates these algorithms are being used at large scale. And they are engaged in something of an arms race.”","The other people interested in Bollen’s work are those who want not only to measure public sentiment, but to change it. Bollen’s research shows how it’s possible. Could you reverse engineer the national, or even the global, mood? Model it, and then change it?","Google, democracy and the truth about internet search","Read more","“It does seem possible. And it does worry me. There are quite a few pieces of research that show if you repeat something often enough, people start involuntarily to believe it. And that could be leveraged, or weaponised for propaganda. We know there are thousands of automated bots out there that are trying to do just that.”","THE war of the bots is one of the wilder and weirder aspects of the elections of 2016. At the Oxford Internet Institute’s Unit for Computational Propaganda, its director, Phil Howard, and director of research, Sam Woolley, show me all the ways public opinion can be massaged and manipulated. But is there a smoking gun, I ask them, evidence of who is doing this? “There’s not a smoking gun,” says Howard. “There are smoking machine guns. There are multiple pieces of evidence.”","“Look at this,” he says and shows me how, before the US election, hundreds upon hundreds of websites were set up to blast out just a few links, articles that were all pro-Trump. “This is being done by people who understand information structure, who are bulk buying domain names and then using automation to blast out a certain message. To make Trump look like he’s a consensus.”","And that requires money?","“That requires organisation and money. And if you use enough of them, of bots and people, and cleverly link them together, you are what’s legitimate. You are creating truth.”","You can take an existing trending topic, such as fake news, and then weaponise it. You can turn it against the very media that uncovered it. Viewed in a certain light, fake news is a suicide bomb at the heart of our information system. Strapped to the live body of us – the mainstream media.","One of the things that concerns Howard most is the hundreds of thousands of “sleeper” bots they’ve found. Twitter accounts that have tweeted only once or twice and are now sitting quietly waiting for a trigger: some sort of crisis where they will rise up and come together to drown out all other sources of information.","Like zombies?","“Like zombies.”","Many of the techniques were refined in Russia, he says, and then exported everywhere else. “You have these incredible propaganda tools developed in an authoritarian regime moving into a free market economy with a complete regulatory vacuum. What you get is a firestorm.”","This is the world we enter every day, on our laptops and our smartphones. It has become a battleground where the ambitions of nation states and ideologues are being fought – using us. We are the bounty: our social media feeds; our conversations; our hearts and minds. Our votes. Bots influence trending topics and trending topics have a powerful effect on algorithms, Woolley, explains, on Twitter, on Google, on Facebook. Know how to manipulate information structure and you can manipulate reality.","We’re not quite in the alternative reality where the actual news has become “FAKE news!!!” But we’re almost there. Out on Twitter, the new transnational battleground for the future, someone I follow tweets a quote by Marshall McLuhan, the great information theorist of the 60s. “World War III will be a guerrilla information war,” it says. “With no divisions between military and civilian participation.”","By that definition we’re already there.","Additional reporting by Paul-Olivier Dehaye","• Carole Cadwalladr will be hosting a discussion on technology’s disruption of democracy at the bluedot festival, Jodrell Bank, Cheshire, 7-9 July","A shadowy operation involving big data, billionaire friends of Trump and the disparate forces of the Leave campaign heavily influenced the result of the EU referendum.

More infoClose You can manage your cookie settings via your browser at any time. To learn more about how we use cookies, please see our cookies policyClose","Health chiefs are failing to investigate a clear pattern of worsening health outcomes","Within the first seven weeks of 2018, some 93 990 people died in England and Wales.1 Over the same weeks in the previous five years, an average of 83 615 people died.1 This rise of 12.4%, or 10 375 additional deaths, was not due to the ageing of the population. Ageing is a slow process and leads to slow, not sudden, rises in mortality.2 An additional person died every seven minutes during the first 49 days of 2018 compared with what had been usual in the previous five years. Why?","Not the weather or flu","The weather was unusually mild during the initial weeks of this year—very cold weather did not arrive until late February. The mean temperature was 4.1°C across the UK in January 2018, almost half a degree above the average for this time of year.3","Nevertheless, the first seven weeks of 2018 were unusual in terms of the operation of the NHS. On 2 January, after “an unprecedented step by NHS officials,” thousands of non-urgent operations were cancelled, a clear sign of a system struggling to cope.4 Many hospitals were already at or beyond their safe working levels, “with high numbers of frail patients stuck on wards for want of social care,”4 and a rise in influenza cases had begun.","The proportion of deaths in the first seven weeks of 2018 caused by respiratory disease was 18.7%. This includes all deaths for which influenza or pneumonia was identified as the underlying cause and compares with 18.3% for the same period in 2017, 15.8% in 2016, 19.5% in 2015, 14.9% in 2014, and 17.9% in 2013. In short, mortality due to the large group of causes that include influenza was not unusually high. Whatever the key reasons are, they do not include an unusual influenza epidemic.","By the seventh week of 2018, there had already been three weeks when more people had died in England and Wales than during the worst single week of 2017 (fig 1). In four of the first seven weeks of 2018, more people died than in the worst week of 2016 or 2014. To date only two weeks in 2015 have been worse than their corresponding week in 2018.1","The past five years have been challenging in terms of health outcomes in the UK.5 Spending on health and social care year on year has increased at a much slower rate than in previous years.6 Outcomes on many indicators have deteriorated, including a rapid recent increase in the numbers of deaths among mental health patients being looked after in care in England and Wales.7","Reduced life expectancy","We know that the Office for National Statistics in the past 12 months reduced its estimate of future life expectancy for both men and women in the UK by almost a year and, in doing so, has estimated that more than a million lives will now end earlier than expected.8 We also learnt within the past year that mortality in infants born into the poorest families in the UK has risen substantially since 2011.9 All this emerged before the most recent weekly mortality figures were released.1","In 2013, official comments on the rise in deaths for some age groups and geographical groups suggested ageing, influenza, and cold weather as the main culprits for adverse changes seen then.10 That was disputed at the time, and three years on from 2015—in which the increase year on year was the worst since at least the 1960s11—a clear lack of consensus remains. No official explanation has been forthcoming for death rates continuing to be so high relative to expectations from previous trends.12 Mortality has continued to improve in all other European countries between 2010 and 2015, most quickly in Norway and Finland, more slowly in some other countries.13","We and others have already called for an urgent investigation by the House of Commons health select committee.14 We did this because the Department of Health and Social Care is not taking the slowdown in improvements in mortality seriously. The figures for this year make the case for an investigation both stronger and more urgent with each passing day.","Footnotes","Competing interests: We have read and understood BMJ policy on declaration of interests and have no relevant interests to declare."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-14"}

It collects data from a wide range of sources, including social media platforms such as Facebook, and its own polling.","With its headquarters in London, the firm was set up in 2013 as an offshoot of another company called SCL Group, which offers similar services around the world.","In an interview with the website Contagious, Cambridge Analytica’s founder, Alexander Nix said it had been set up “to address the vacuum in the US Republican political market” that became evident when Mitt Romney was defeated in the 2012 presidential election.","“The Democrats had ostensibly been leading the tech revolution, and data analytics and digital engagement were areas where Republicans had failed to catch up. We saw this as an opportunity.”","Why is it in the news?","Kogan assembled the information through an app on the site – it collected details of Americans who were paid to take a personality test, but also gathered data on those people’s Facebook friends.","Kogan had a deal to share this information with Cambridge Analytica. But according to a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, most of this personal information had been taken without authorisation. He said Cambridge Analytica used it to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","In a statement published on Saturday, the company denied any wrongdoing and said it did not harvest Facebook data, and none was used in the 2016 presidential election. It said it fully complied with Facebook’s terms of service and it had deleted all the data it received from GSR.","What does Facebook say?","It has suspended Cambridge Analytica and several individuals from its site while it investigates.

The main player is 42-year-old Nix, an old Etonian who joined SCL in 2003 after studying at Manchester University and working in corporate finance. Nix developed the political arm of the business. Last year, he told Techcrunch of plans to publish a book about the company, provisionally titled ‘Mad men to maths men’.","The managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division is Mark Turnbull, who spent 18 years at the communications firm Bell Pottinger before joining SCL.","What are Cambridge Analytica’s links with Donald Trump?","Robert Mercer, a key Trump supporter and donor, gave $15m in funding to Cambridge Analytica. Mercer, who also funded the rightwing website Breitbart, was introduced to the firm by Steve Bannon. Bannon, who was on its board from 2014 to 2016, headed the last phase of Trump’s election campaign and then served as his chief strategist.","The company worked on three candidates’ campaigns for the presidency, including Trump’s. On its website it describes analysing millions of data points to identify the most persuadable voters and the issues they cared about and then sending them messages to “move them to action”.

It reveals almost nothing about the social network or its data policies that wasn’t already widely known, and there’s little evidence of blatant wrongdoing by Facebook or its employees. It’s also far from clear what impact, if any, the ill-gotten personal data had on the election’s outcome.","In short, the outrage now directed at Facebook feels disproportionate to the company’s culpability in this specific episode. But that doesn’t mean people are wrong to be outraged. For Facebook, the larger scandal here is not what shadowy misdeeds it allowed Cambridge Analytica to do. It’s what Facebook allowed anyone to do, in plain sight—and, more broadly, it’s the data-fueled online business model that Facebook helped to pioneer.","The Facebook tools and policies that allowed researcher Aleksandr Kogan in 2014 to obtain information for the political-data firm Cambridge Analytica—via an app called Thisismydigitallife—were public and well-known. They were also quite permissive, allowing developers to collect data not only on users who signed up for their app, but also on those users’ Facebook friends. (Facebook has since changed that policy.) As the Washington Post points out, entities ranging from Tinder to FarmVille to Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign used the same tool to collect many of the same kinds of information. As late as 2015, this was simply how Facebook worked.","The people who used Kogan’s app explicitly granted it access to that data, albeit for academic, not commercial, purposes. (There’s a strong case to be made, of course, that Facebook should never have allowed users to sign away their friends’ privacy in that way.) For what it’s worth, Facebook’s policies did not permit the sort of misrepresentation that Kogan appears to have engaged in. And by Facebook’s own account, when the company found out that he had used the data for unauthorized purposes, it required both him and Cambridge Analytica to delete it and to certify to the company that they had done so. It now appears that they may have lied. But it’s not clear that Facebook had any way of knowing that.","As for what Cambridge Analytica did with that information, you could argue that has been overblown, too. Sinister as it sounds, “psychographic” targeting—advertising to people based on information about their attitudes, interests, and personality traits—is an imprecise science at best and “snake oil” at worst. Distilled to its essence, the Cambridge Analytica scandal is a case of campaign consultants using some shady tactics to try to get their message out to the most receptive audience in the most effective way they can. That is, in a word, politics.","From Facebook’s perspective, then, the company is on the ropes mostly because an unscrupulous developer abused a permissive data policy that it has since tightened. (There’s also the fact that it apparently kept the 2015 leak of user data quiet for years and that it hired and continues to employ a researcher who was connected to it. Facebook has not commented on either of those reports.) It’s possible to imagine rogue app developers exploiting other platforms, such as Twitter, Android, or Apple’s iOS, in an analogous fashion.","That helps to explain why Facebook executives mounted a tone-deaf defense of their company on Twitter this past weekend, even as the outcry kept growing: They really don’t think they did much wrong here. The company’s chief security officer, among others, pushed back on the March 17 Guardian story that broke the scandal for referring to it as a “data breach.” (That executive, Alex Stamos, has since deleted his tweets, and he confirmed reports Monday that he is no longer Facebook’s CSO and is planning to leave the company in August.) As Tiffany C. Li pointed out in Slate, the semantic point matters because a data breach could expose Facebook to legal action from state governments and the Federal Trade Commission, including fines and other remedies.","But if there was no data breach, and Facebook’s security wasn’t compromised, then why isn’t it just Cambridge Analytica that’s in the barrel thisweek?","But if there was no data breach, and Facebook’s security wasn’t compromised, then why isn’t it just Cambridge Analytica that’s in the barrel this week?","It’s partly because the stakes in this particular data scandal are so high. Had the same data been used to sell people refrigerators or send them email spam, the story would not be playing out on such a big stage. In other words: Almost any significant role Facebook played in the success of the Donald Trump would be a momentous one, because his victory altered the course of history. Many of those who opposed Trump are still furious and still searching for people to blame. And we already know Facebook was a key part of his strategy, as it was for the U.K.’s Brexit campaign, in which Cambridge Analytica was also involved.","But there’s another reason Facebook is getting pilloried over this in a way that another technology company—say, Apple or Microsoft—might not. It isn’t just that Facebook was careless with its users’ data in this instance or that its policy of allowing third-party apps access to information on users’ friends was cavalier and misguided (though it certainly was both of those). It’s that Facebook is the chief architect of the entire socio-commercial arrangement by which people around the world routinely offer up their personal information in exchange for the free use of online services.","Facebook isn’t just the source of the data that Cambridge Analytica used. It’s the reason this sort of data—organized in this way—exists in the first place. Sure, Google and Twitter and plenty of other companies employ similar business models. And the idea of supporting a website by showing people ads has been around longer still. But it was Facebook, more than any of these, that taught people around the world to freely give themselves online and to accept the use of their personal data in targeted advertisements as the price of admission to the modern internet.","If you think of that data, and the ads, as a relatively small price to pay for the privilege of seamless connection to everyone you know and care about, then Facebook looks like the wildly successful, path-breaking company that made it all possible. But if you start to think of the bargain as Faustian—with hidden long-term costs that overshadow the obvious benefits—then that would make Facebook the devil.","This scandal has made the grand bargain of the social web look a little more Faustian than it didbefore.","What this scandal did, then, was make the grand bargain of the social web look a little more Faustian than it did before.","From that perspective, the real scandal is that this wasn’t a data breach or some egregious isolated error on Facebook’s part. What Cambridge Analytica did was, in many ways, what Facebook was optimized for—collating personal information about vast numbers of people in handy packets that could then be used to try to sell them something.","Yes, the rules were supposed to prohibit these specific packets from being used in this specific way. But with high enough stakes, it was probable, if not inevitable, that those rules would be broken. Facebook appears to have given little thought to how to enforce them, beyond shaking hands and hoping for the best. All indications are that it simply cared more about growth in 2014 than it did about users’ privacy. That the company has evidently matured in recent years doesn’t excuse the way it was built.","TechCrunch’s Josh Constine has followed Facebook as closely as anyone in the media over the past five years, and he’s been known to defend the company when it seems just about everyone else is attacking it. Not this time. In a piece headlined, “Facebook and the Endless String of Worst-Case Scenarios,” he catalogues nearly a dozen instances over the years in which the company has launched products without the safeguards needed to prevent abuse, then ignored or downplayed the consequences.","That habit may be catching up to it at last: Facebook is not getting the benefit of many doubts when it comes to Cambridge Analytica, and it’s hard to feel much sympathy for it. The time for Facebook to self-regulate its way out of the hot seat has probably passed. Now it’s up to the public, legislators, and regulators to rework the terms of that agreement by which people sign away their personal data—and one another’s—for the benefit of tech platforms, their advertising clients, and whoever else might be sneaky enough to get their hands on it."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The announcement is another kick to Facebook, which has been grappling with the fallout from a scandal where data from the social media platform leaked through a third-party app.","“Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook,” said Tom Paul, acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement. “Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","Rob Sherman, deputy chief privacy officer at Facebook, said in an emailed statement to Threatpost: “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”","Part of the FTC’s investigation may center around whether Facebook violated a consent decree from 2011, which requires the social network to receive explicit permission from users in regards to sharing their data with third parties. Facebook could face up to $40,000 in fines per violation if found guilty, according to CNBC.","The investigation stems around Facebook’s acknowledgement earlier this month that since 2015 a third-party application had handed over the data of up to 50 million platform users to Cambridge Analytica – a consulting group that has worked on several high-profile political campaigns, including that of President Donald Trump’s.","Adding to questions about the company’s privacy policies were reports this weekend that the company had been logging Android users’ call and text history without their permission. Facebook responded to the reports on Sunday saying that some users’ information has been logged, but stressing that the function has “always been opt-in only,” that the information collected doesn’t include the contents of calls or texts, and that the data isn’t sold to third parties.","The company has faced a slew of public backlash –including a wave of politicians who have called on Facebook to enforce privacy policies to protect user data, and business leaders, from Elon Musk to Whatsapp co-founder Brian Acton joining in on a #DeleteFacebook campaign via social media against the company.","In the midst of all this are reports that Facebook’s security chief, Alex Stamos is planning to step down from the company in August, after he was met with resistance after advocating for more disclosure around Russian manipulation of the platform and some restructuring to better address related issues.","Facebook has responded to the Cambridge Analytica blowout over the past week, with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg taking out full-page newspaper ads in the New York Times, WSJ, and Washington Post, among others, this weekend to pledge “responsibility” to end users.","“This was a breach of trust and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time. We’re now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” said the ad, a signed letter from Zuckerberg. “I promise to do better for you.”","The Facebook fallout has raised questions about how social media platforms can increase best practices around managing and securing third party data privacy for end users. James Robinson, VP of Third Party Risk Management at Optiv, said that the incident has brought to light several fundamental data privacy and security issues, “issues that, while not new, need to be better understood.”","“We are living in a world powered by platforms, APIs and data, and, as such, third- and fourth-party risk management is of paramount importance,” said Robinson. “As enterprises increasingly leverage mobile and social platforms to advance customer relations and business operations, they must adopt a threat management plan to ensure user privacy and data security.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

So my own view is it was much more than 50M.”","We’ve reached out to Facebook about Wylie’s claim — but at the time of writing the company has not provided a response.","“There were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,” Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says users’ data was obtained by CA. “It first started as a very small pilot — firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral register… We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallife deployed via Facebook’s platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014.","“That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.”","The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie.","“This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.”","Facebook has previously confirmed 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it.","Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing.","Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reported that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform.","In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak.","It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes. EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that.","“There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.”","Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, Facebook settled with the FTC over charges it had deceived users by “telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public”.","And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal.","Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.","When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data.","The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data” — and further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it says re: GSR data.","Asked by the committee about Nix’s early, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”.","“That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data.","Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered.","He also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”.","Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it tried to identify via patterns it could identify in big data.","He said:","For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC. And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like.","“That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.”","Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later.","“The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data”","Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms.","Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.”","The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions.","“That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” he added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.”","Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.”","The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns.","Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used.","“Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.”","In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: “The source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property.”","Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA.","“It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore.","“But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].”","The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”.","During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform for some reason.","“He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted?","“It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.”","We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either.","Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge. They certainly didn’t with me — until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no I’ve actually given over everything to the authorities.”","“I suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016… they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,” he added. “So I don’t think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach that’s going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.”","“All kinds of people [had] access to the data,” he added. “It was everywhere.”","Related Articles","Elaine Burke | Silicon Republic Startups Some people bide their time until the opportunity to take their rightful ‘seat at the table’ finally presents itself.

These three data giants not only tap into shopper loyalty programs, but also consumer purchase habits, demographic information and a host of other options from both online and offline consumer activity.","You can now target people who are interested in vacationing in Idaho.","For purposes directly related to this article, it’s important to note that Facebook also acquires behavior, demographic and interest data from its own internal data collection. Additionally, they collect data from external sources such as the “U.S. Census, warranty cards, registration information, the Department of Motor Vehicles, public record information, survey data and other offline sources.”","Facebook also gathers “U.S. consumer data on where consumers shop, how they shop, what products and brands they purchase, the publications they read and their demographic and psychographic attributes.”","Below I discuss how all of that data helps Facebook advertisers refine their target audience according to demographics, interests and behaviors.","#1: Use Demographic Data to Hone Audiences","As a consumer, it may be disconcerting to know that Facebook collects so much personal data. As an advertiser, it’s the jackpot.","Facebook uses the data it collects to provide you with deep demographic targeting. Before, that wealth of information was reserved for advanced advertisers who used Power Editor. Now it’s available to everyone via Facebook’s Ad Creation tool.","To use the extensive demographic targeting, create an ad and scroll down to the Audience options (under the Text and Links box) and click the More Demographics button.","For example, if you select the Relationship option, you’ll see Interested In and Relationship Status. These two categories are strikingly similar to the old Facebook demographic options. However, when you click through and examine each, you see how broad the segments have become.","Now you can target not only users who are married, single or divorced, but also open relationship, complicated, domestic partnership, separated, civil union and more.","Each general demographic offers several subsets for even deeper targeting.","Each of the 10 main demographic options offers this type of expanded segment choice. I encourage you to click through each to see what options are available to you.","#2: Segment Interests to Lower Ad Costs","Not too long ago, Interests was the only option in the Ad Creation tool that allowed advertisers to segment their audience.","According to Facebook, Interests now include “pages [users have] liked, their interests and activities.”","Based on the interests you choose to target, Facebook provides suggestions or lets you browse through a list of related interests that allow you to segment your audience to a greater degree.","In this example, I’ve selected Home and Garden as an interest, and Facebook has suggested HGTV, Home Improvement, DIY, Interior Design and more.","Every general interest comes with suggestions or additional list ideas.","When choosing interests, be as focused as possible. Interests are an important factor in lowering your cost per click (CPC) and raising your click-through rate (CTR).","This is where a keen appreciation for your target audience truly comes into play. If you do not understand your audiences’ interests, hobbies and activities, you’ll have a difficult time bringing down ad costs and increasing ROI.","#3: Incorporate Behavior for High Conversions","Behavior targeting is mostly a result of offline activities and is extremely effective at creating conversions.","While it can be a very powerful tool, behavior targeting can also cut a large chunk out of your ad budget. Of the three—demographics, interests and behavior—I’ve personally found behavior targeting to be the most expensive.","As shown in the image below, behavior choices are quite varied. Each one of the categories provides hundreds of behavior targeting opportunities.","Choose behaviors based on your audience’s offline activities.","For example, the Automotive category includes focused targeting for New Vehicle Buyers (near market), New Vehicle Shoppers (in market) and Used Vehicle Buyers (in market).","Consider the possibilities of targeting expectant parents who are in the market for a new crossover or hybrid vehicle. If you already know they’re in the market and you develop a highly targeted ad campaign centered around the type of car they’re looking for, there is no doubt your conversion rate will be extremely high.","Each behavior choice offers similarly detailed information. Purchase behavior in particular is a targeting goldmine. Select any of its subsets to bring up an entirely new list of options you can use to segment your audience.","As an example, if you’re interested in purchase behavior related to anyone interested in sports and outdoors, you can narrow the market down to specific sports and combine that with high-end or low-end retail to segment even further.","Kandice Linwright is a social media strategist specializing in veterinary-specific marketing.

Facebook was already in hot water thanks to controversy surrounding Cambridge Analytica and Facebook’s sharing of data via an app with that company. In a second major hit, several sources appear to have confirmed that Facebook has been scraping phone call and text messaging data from Android devices and storing it for some time. What is unclear is whether that data has been shared with anyone else. Facebook has denied any wrongdoing in connection with this latest revelation.","The latest firestorm was kicked off by a New Zealand man who pulled down a data archive from Facebook and discovered extensive phone call metadata including names, numbers and the length of phone calls. Several other users performed a similar review of their Facebook data archives and confirmed similar data was present.","According to statements from Facebook, sharing phone contacts to the Facebook app is part of their effort to “help you make connections” and “to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with.” Facebook claims that contact uploading and sharing is optional, but it does help with their friend recommendation algorithm by trying to identify people a user communicates with on a regular basis and then assuming one would want to connect with that person on Facebook. Facebook also started offering an option at one point for users to opt-in to using Messenger as their default SMS client. Even in this latter case, the opt-in message does not appear to have made it clear that Facebook was retaining any data related to calls or text messages.","However, even if a user declined to user Messenger – in some cases not evening installing the client app on their device – or apps that were requesting permission to gather contacts data, it appears Facebook was still accessing this information on end user Android devices. Perhaps worse than the access to this data is that Facebook was retaining this information for unknown reasons. Some users are also pointing to Google as being partly to blame due to the way their APIs worked up until this past fall when an old API was finally deprecated which was allowing some data sharing between apps, including Facebook.","Facebook continues to deny any wrongdoing with regard to this data collection revelation, although they have shared information on how to turn off the connection by ensuring “continuous contact uploading” is turned off. Facebook also offers a contact management tool that will let a user delete all contacts, although this does not appear to scrub the already obtained call and messaging data.","In light of the different privacy revelations and word of mounting government investigations, Facebook stock has lost nearly twenty percent of its value over the past couple weeks.","Raised in North Carolina, Jeff Causey is a licensed CPA in North Carolina. Jeff's past Android devices include an HTC EVO, a Samsung Note II, an LG G3, and a Motorola Moto X Pure Edition along with a Samsung Galaxy Tablet 10.1. He currently uses a Samsung Galaxy S8 and (very rarely) a Nexus 7 (2013). He is also using a Verizon-branded Motorola Moto Z Play Droid supplied by his job.

In a statement issued on March 26, FTC Consumer Protection Bureau Acting Director Tom Pahl said that the FTC \"takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.\"","The FTC investigation will likely focus on what data Facebook shares with third parties. But third parties aren't the only entity hoping to win \"friends\" and influence people on this social platform. Facebook collects a great deal of information about users for use by its internal algorithms. Those algorithms govern who and what users see, whom they get recommended to \"friend,\" and other aspects of how our Facebook experiences are subtly (or sometimes not-so-subtly) shaped by advertisers and others leveraging the platform.","As Ars reported, Facebook has pushed users to allow access to SMS messages and call logs with its Messenger and Facebook Lite applications under the auspices of providing a service. \"Keep up with all your conversations in one place\" by using the app as the default SMS application on Android phones, Facebook offers. Previous versions of the Facebook mobile app on Android (in versions of Android prior to 4.1) were able to read SMS and call logs simply by asking for access to contacts, which Facebook has described as standard practice for applications. This allowed Facebook to keep track of the time, length, and contact information for any call made or received by the Android device by uploading it to Facebook's data centers. Facebook could also access metadata about text and multimedia messages sent via SMS.","Further Reading","Facebook asserts that it does all of this tracking with users' consent. The requests given for that consent, however, may be confusing and misleading, though they have become more explicit over the last two years.","Enlarge/ This is how Facebook Messenger asks to gain access to your contacts, SMS, and phone call logs now. It's not obvious that call logs are part of either of these asks.","Tinfoil hats not required","Some Facebook users have said that Facebook did more than just collect metadata from messages. Multiple individuals recounted to Ars occasions when they had the content of text message conversations nearly immediately affect advertisements they were shown on Facebook. These users say they saw ads that were specific to locations or services that were discussed via SMS, but those subjects were never the focus of Facebook posts or other Facebook content.","Facebook probably doesn't need to go that far. Much of that coincidence is derived from the power of Facebook's \"social graph\" database and the technology Facebook developed to power its search features. Graph databases link \"entities\" (people, products, interests, locations) with relationships, making it possible for algorithms to crawl down the connections between different entities to uncover hidden potential affinities or relationships. And features like plugging into call and SMS data, SMS text flow, data from sites carrying Facebook-hosted advertisements or \"like\" and \"share\" buttons, and location data from mobile allow Facebook to make those sorts of connections dynamically, in near-real time.","Those sorts of connections aren't obvious to users who download archives of their Facebook data, but they are certainly suggested by parts of it. The \"Ads Topics\" data that was in my personal Facebook archive included very specific terms linked to my pattern of life: specific people I have interacted with, services I have looked at websites related to (\"Kitchen\" is a recent high-scoring one, thanks to searches related to remodeling plans), places I have visited or may be interested in, and organizations I either have an affiliation with or a research interest in.","These could be valuable to all sorts of organizations, including nation-states; my Ads Topics of \"Noam Chomsky,\" \"North Korea,\" \"US Department of Defense,\" and the New York City and Baltimore Police Departments could be interpreted in all sorts of ways when taken together, for example.","Google collects similar data on users. You can relive your travels courtesy of Google Timeline with sometimes disconcerting fidelity: all the places you've gone with your Android phone, the routes you took, the photos you took along the way in a handy Google Maps format. Google's algorithms and cookies follow your searches and page visits to sites with Google and Doubleclick advertisements, and the bots that used to read the contents of your emails to deliver the targeted advertisements that pay for those services (Google has discontinued that practice).","All of this data is collected, as with Facebook's collection, with your implied permission. And as with Facebook, the raw data is not directly readable by third parties (other than law enforcement agencies).","But the data Google collects contains significantly less direct and inferred information about an individual's relationships, affiliations, activities, and intents. While Google has an entity database technology of its own among other \"big data\" systems used as part of its search and advertising services, it has not yet applied that power in a way that mirrors Facebook's global social graph.","So, it's important to remember one underlying truth when using any of these \"free\" services owned by Google, Facebook, Snap, Twitter, and the like: we users are not their customers; we're their product."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The apparent misuse of Facebook data—and the social media giant’s failure to police it—leave both companies with plenty still to answer for.","Facebook has suspended both Cambridge and SCL while it investigates whether both companies retained Facebook user data that had been provided by third-party researcher Aleksandr Kogan of the company Global Science Research, a violation of Facebook’s terms. The suspensions were announced just hours before The New York Times and The Guardian published stories Saturday morning describing how Cambridge Analytica harvested data on 50 million US Facebook users, a number far larger than the 270,000 accounts Facebook initially cited. Facebook says it knew about the breach, but had received legally binding guarantees from the company that all of the data was deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice president and general counsel, wrote in a blog post Friday night. Facebook is also suspending Kogan, as well as Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, the whistleblower who led to stories in The Guardian and The New York Times.","In a statement, a spokesperson for SCL denied the claims. “Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data,” the statement read. (Cambridge is an independent company in the United States that was spun out of SCL.)","According to one source, a trove of Facebook users’ personal data was visible on Cambridge’s internal databases in 2017.","And yet, following Facebook’s announcement Friday night, sources close to Cambridge confirmed to WIRED that this data was still accessible as recently as last year. According to one source, a trove of Facebook users’ personal data was visible on Cambridge’s internal databases in 2017, despite SCL’s current denial and past promises to both Cambridge employees and Facebook that it had all been deleted in 2015. The data included Facebook IDs, and responses to personality surveys that had been administered by Kogan in 2015. Another source close to the company recalled seeing a database called “Kogan-import” in Cambridge’s system, which was only visible to a small number of staffers in data science, engineering, and IT. The source says the database was tightly controlled in terms of who could edit or delete it.","Asked to confirm whether this database existed, an SCL spokesperson said, “We did a system wide internal audit to verify that all GSR data had been removed before we signed an undertaking to Facebook.”","The data in question was gathered using an app called thisisyourdigitallife, created by Kogan, that offered Facebook users personality quizzes. Those who downloaded the app voluntarily turned over reams of personal data about what they like, where they live, and in some cases, depending on individual privacy settings, who their friends were.","Though Facebook says just 270,000 people downloaded the app, a loophole at the time apparently allowed Kogan to collect vastly more information. Until 2014, apps could also collect information on every users’ entire friend network. Facebook shut down that capability for app developers in mid-2014, but offered some apps that were already up and running a small grace period before cutting them off. That timing roughly lines up with Kogan’s research. Of the 50 million accounts Kogan had data on, the New York Times and Guardian reports say, 30 million had complete enough profiles that Cambridge could create psychographic profiles of them. Different than demographic profiles, these describe people based on their personality types.","Kogan passed the survey results on to SCL and Cambridge. Facebook learned about this violation in 2015, removed the app, and requested that Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information. In a statement, an SCL spokesperson said the company deleted the data as soon as they found out it violated Facebook’s policies.","Under this suspension, none of the involved companies will be permitted to buy ads or manage their clients’ Facebook accounts. The Trump campaign hasn’t worked with Cambridge since the 2016 election, according to a source close to the campaign.","For Cambridge Analytica, this represents the nadir of what has been a steady downward spiral since election night 2016. Earlier Friday, David Carroll, a professor at the New School, filed a legal claim against SCL Group under British data protection law, seeking disclosures for how his data was used in the 2016 election and whether that US voter data was processed illegally overseas. The legal proceedings come in the midst of an ongoing investigation by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office into Cambridge Analytica’s role in the Leave.EU campaign, which advocated for the United Kingdom to break with the European Union in the 2016 Brexit vote. Cambridge officials had spoken publicly about working for Leave.EU, but CEO Alexander Nix has since denied it in testimony before Parliament.","On Saturday, the ICO issued a statement saying it continues to investigate how Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used. “We are continuing to invoke all of our powers and are pursuing a number of live lines of inquiry. Any criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously,” the statement said.","‘Facebook never comes forward with information until their backs are against the wall.’","Jonathan Albright, Columbia University","Nix also became a key figure in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, after news broke that he had contacted representatives for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in the run-up to the election, seeking information about hacked emails Wikileaks had received. Nix has confirmed initiating this contact. This apparently prompted the Trump campaign to issue a statement seemingly designed to distance the campaign from Cambridge Analytica, a firm which had already amassed doubters and critics even before the 2016 election. Long before Cambridge even began working with the Trump campaign, Republican strategists accused the company of inflating its capabilities.","Now, it appears even Cambridge is working to place rhetorical distance between Nix and the company’s work in United States elections. In a statement provided to The New York Times, the company said Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election.","The chaos has led to a mass exodus from the company’s nascent US political team. Nearly all of the staff that worked in the Trump campaign’s San Antonio digital office are no longer at Cambridge, and sources say its political business within the United States has dwindled. Once feared by Republican digital firms as a threat to their business and by Democrats as a threat to democracy, Cambridge has steadily ceded influence since its 2016 highs.","“The defanging of Cambridge is about just colossal fuckups over and over,” one source close to Cambridge said.","Losing Facebook as an advertising platform, the source said, should further destabilize the already declining company. “There’s no way this doesn’t have a substantial impact on their business,” another source familiar with Cambridge said.","The weekend’s revelations don’t paint Facebook in a positive light, either. After two years in which Facebook has struggled to explain how Russian propaganda and fake news proliferated on the platform, it now must explain one of its fundamental flaws: Facebook offers unprecedented data to its paying clients, but has next to no controls in place to ensure that data will be handled properly.","In a statement Saturday morning, Facebook’s Grewal said, “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all—and take action against all offending parties.”","And yet, Facebook shares some of the blame. The company’s executives have repeatedly been brought before Congress to testify about how the platform was used and abused during the 2016 election. The fact that the company discovered a major data breach by a vendor to the Trump campaign seems worthy of public disclosure well before three years have passed. “Facebook never comes forward with information until their backs are against the wall,” said Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. “This is a mess.”","Facebook can, of course, punish entities that violate its policies, as it is doing with Cambridge and SCL, and it may have grounds for legal action. But the damage has already been done."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K.

Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

However, the sheer volume of the selling can amount to an overhang on the stock at a time when it could use all the support it can get.","“The insiders use Rule 10b5-1 to sell on a regular basis. There are trading plans that they adopt and then they sell shares in a methodological manner,” said Ben Silverman, director of research at InsiderScore. “I don’t see a connection between the insider selling and the news that has come out in the last few days.”","Still, investors and analysts who make buying and selling decisions based on executive stock moves give these plans some weight despite the benign status companies try to assign them.","“They can cancel the plans any time they want,” Silverman said. “Obviously [it’s] something we’ll look for in the wake of what’s going on and see if there’s any decrease in the insider selling volume in the near term.”","Companies often compensate executives with stock, which they can sell at their discretion or according to a scheduled plan as determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rule 10b5-1. After Facebook, the highest volume of insider selling during the last three months was at RealPage, Oritani Financial and Vonage, each selling more than half a million insider shares, according to the Vickers data.","Zuckerberg’s sales accounted for the most, by far. He announced plans in September to sell 35 million to 75 million shares over the next 18 months to fund philanthropic efforts. He and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have promised to give away 99 percent of their company stake to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which has focused on disease and education.","In the last two weeks, Zuckerberg sold 228,400 shares a day on March 8 and March 9, 220,000 shares a day on March 12 and March 13, and 245,400 shares on March 14, the Vickers data showed.","That’s a total of just over 1.14 million shares sold at an average price of $183.81, for a payout of nearly $210 million. As of Wednesday, Zuckerberg still held nearly 393.1 million shares, or 13.53 percent of common shares outstanding, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.","However, he has seen his wealth drop to around $66 billion from $75 billion since the stock closed on Friday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index and Forbes.","The Vickers data also showed that Facebook’s Chief Technology Officer Michael Todd Schroepfer sold 38,024 shares on March 13. At the average price of $183.20, the stock sale brought in about $6,970,000.","Schroepfer has been selling every second week of the month since November 2016, said InsiderScore’s Silverman. “He’s probably selling under a plan that was adopted quite a while ago.”","Facebook declined to comment about the scheduled insider selling and the share-price decline.","WHILE YOU ARE HERE…","The mass censorship of independent media is exploding.

In order for you to make this request, every organisation must provide Canadians the contact information for their company’s privacy officer, no matter how small or large the company is.\nFor Facebook, they have a page they call Data Policy Questions, which includes a link for requesting your personal data. They describe on that page how to download your Facebook data, which might be enough for your needs, but as I’m writing this partially in response to the issue around Facebook’s relationship with Cambridge Analytica, that information is not included in the default personal information archive. Thus, at this stage you will want to click on the link to make a data access request.\nThis is where it gets tricky, as Facebook doesn’t want you to easily have access to whom they’ve disclosed your personal information to. On the Personal Data Requests page, you have to click “This doesn’t answer my question” and you will see three options, with the last one being “Other”. You need to click the other option to see the manual request form. I notice they don’t have a text box to request specific data, but this is where you can see the actual email address to make the request, finally:Â datarequests@support.facebook.com","OK, now we have the email address, which request should you make? You need to make sure in the email you identify a) your personal contact information — both so they can contact you, but also so they know which Facebook account is yours b) that you’re creating this request as per PIPEDA, and which section.\nFor part a, I’ll leave that up to you. I included my email, phone number, a request for a written response (I don’t want a phone call unless it’s for clarification of which information I’m requesting), and a link to my Facebook profile. In my case it’s https://facebook.com/hates.privacy, but you can find your URL by clicking on your name or profile at the top of your Facebook profile and copy/pasting the URL in your browser at this point.\nFor B, what you are requesting regarding PIPEDA isÂ information about an identifiable individual.

(Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)","But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.","Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.","He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”","Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”","Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”","Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.","“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”","Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.","Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.","But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.","“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”","He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”","The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.","The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.","“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.","The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.","In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)","“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”","Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were alarmed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.","“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”","Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.","He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.","“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”","Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, including Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.","“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A20 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘You Will Not Destroy America’: Trump’s Targets Fire Back.

It's right. What really happened is much worse.","On Saturday, an investigation by The New York Times, the Guardian, and its sister publication The Observer revealed that the data analytics firm that helped the Donald Trump presidential campaign had harvested the Facebook data of more than 50 million people in an effort to profile users and eventually target them with political ads.","In 2014, a researcher collected the data through an app that asked users to take a personality test for academic research purposes. Around 270,000 people agreed to have their data collected through the test, which its creator, Aleksandr Kogan, defined as “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.” But thanks to Facebook’s terms of service and its API at the time, the app was also able to collect data of their friends. This gave the researcher, who later handed the data to Cambridge Analytica, the raw information of more than 50 million people, according to the reports, which were largely based on the account of a former Cambridge Analytica data scientist.","The Observer called it one of Facebook’s “biggest ever data breaches.” The Times only referred to the incident as a “breach” once, using the term “leak” throughout the rest of the article. We at Motherboard believe the use of the expression “data breach” in this case is incorrect and may be confusing to readers.","As the news spread and echoed online, several websites and other publications called it a data breach. Manysecurityexperts and researchers—and Facebook itself—believe this is the wrong expression to refer to what happened here.","“It is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Facebook’s chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote in a deleted tweet.","Facebook’s vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false,” because the researcher who made the app obtained the data from “users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.”","Got a tip? You can contact this reporter securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, OTR chat at lorenzo@jabber.ccc.de, or email lorenzo@motherboard.tv","Saying that “everyone involved” consented seems misleading, given that only around 270,000 out of the 50 million people who got their data harvested reportedly signed up for the app. The others probably had no idea this app even existed. And since Facebook changes its privacy settings so frequently, we also don't know if the people who agreed to use the app fully understood what kind of data they were giving up. And no one at the time knew the data would later be handed out to a shadowy data analytics firm hired by the Trump campaign.","While we understand why some are describing the data Kogan handed to Cambridge Analytica as a breach, based on what’s been reported so far, we believe that describing this incident as a breach would, at least at the moment, mislead our readers.","We’ve been regularly covering data breaches for years. No one hacked into Facebook’s servers exploiting a bug, like hackers did when they stole the personal data of more than 140 million people from Equifax. No one tricked Facebook users into giving away their passwords and then stole their data, like Russian hackers did when they broke into the email accounts of John Podesta and others through phishing emails.","In 2014, when Kogan collected the data of 50 million people, he was playing by the rules. At the time, Facebook allowed third party apps to collect not only the data of the people who consented to giving it up, but also their friends’ data. The company later shut down this functionality.","Facebook says the data was misused because Kogan told Facebook he would use it only for academic research. But that might be the only anomalous thing about this case.","Facebook obviously doesn't want the public to think it suffered a massive security breach, like Yahoo did in 2013 and 2014. We agree not because we want to minimize the significance of the Cambridge Analytica story, but because the real story is far more troubling: This data collection was par for the course. In other words, it was a feature, not a bug. And while the process that Kogan exploited is no longer allowed, Facebook still collects—and then sells—massive amounts of data on its users.","As Zeynep Tufekci, the author of Twitter And Tear Gas, put it, Facebook’s vehement defense that this was not a data breach is itself actually a damning statement of what’s wrong with Facebook, and Silicon Valley’s ad industry in general.","“If your business is building a massive surveillance machinery, the data will eventually be used & misused,” Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies the social impact of technology, wrote on Twitter. “There is no informed consent because it's not possible to reasonably inform or consent.”","Facebook’s security team, Tufekci concluded, can’t mitigate the company’s business model, which is predicated on collecting as much of our data, and our friend’s data, as possible.","We can condemn the misuse of this data, and Facebook’s data collection practices, without calling it a data breach, a term that may confuse readers and distract them from what we believe is the real problem here: Silicon Valley giants have built massive data collection machines with almost no guardrails on how they are used."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The paper calls it Facebook’s biggest data breach to date.","The details come from a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who said he worked with Aleksandr Kogan, a student at Cambridge University, to obtain the data. Kogan created an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that paid users to take a personality test. Participants had to sign in through their Facebook login and agree to let their data be used for academic purposes.","The app went beyond its seemingly stated scope, however, pulling in data from the friends lists of any test-takers. Facebook’s platform policy only allows developers the use of friend data to enhance a user’s personal experience. The app put that data, from more than 50 million profiles in all, to work instead.","All the data mined from the app became a vital piece of the software Cambridge Analytica used to profile United States voters and serve them with personalized ads ahead of the 2016 election. The U.K. firm has been credited in the past for playing a key role in Donald Trump’s ascent to the White House.","“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie said.","According to The Observer, Facebook “took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals” after learning of the “unprecedented” data harvesting in late 2015. It’s not clear why more drastic steps weren’t taken back then, though yesterday’s action is easier to decode.","Facebook’s Friday suspension of Cambridge Analytica from the platform came four days after The Observer asked the social media company for comment on the whistleblower’s story. Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, was also suspended while the investigation plays out.","Wylie provided The Observer with a dossier of evidence illustrating Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of the data, including emails, invoices, contracts, and bank transfers that point to the scope of the breach. Also in the dossier is an August 2016 letter from Facebook lawyers instructing Wylie to destroy any data collected by Global Science Research, Kogan’s front company.","The letter arrived just a few days before Stephen K. Bannon, a part owner of Cambridge Analytica and former vice president of the company’s board, signed on as Trump’s campaign manager.","Facebook takes the position that data harvested by GSR and Cambridge Analytica doesn’t qualify as a breach. In a statement given to The Observer, the social media company claims Kogan’s app “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” as the info was passed along to third parties.","The company also said Kogan’s app was removed in 2015, and anyone with access to the data had to certify that it had been destroyed. That timing doesn’t line up with Wylie’s August 2016 letter, however.","“We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.

His administration, with help from Republicans in Congress, has often targeted environmental rules it sees as overly burdensome to the fossil fuel industry, including major Obama-era policies aimed at fighting climate change.","The Environmental Protection Agency has been involved in more than a third of the policy reversals identified by The Times. Scott Pruitt, the head of the E.P.A. who spearheaded the administration’s agenda of environmental deregulation, resigned after facing a number of ethics scandals. Andrew Wheeler, the new acting chief of the agency, is a former coal lobbyist who also wants to roll back environmental regulations.","Rules targeted for reversal so far include key Obama-era efforts to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, as well as broader air and water pollution controls and protections for threatened animals and habitats. The Trump administration has, in many instances, pared back these regulations in favor of more expansive energy extraction policies — often as a direct response to petitions from oil, gas and coal companies. Mr. Trump has argued that supporting the fossil fuel industry strengthens the economy.","The list above represents two types of policy changes: rules that have been officially reversed and those still in progress. Other rules, summarized at the bottom of this page, were undone but later reinstated after legal challenges.","The process of rolling back regulations has not always been smooth, in part because the administration has in some cases skipped steps like notifying the public and asking for comment. In several cases, courts have been asked to intervene to get agencies to follow their own policies.","All told, the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks could lead to at least 80,000 extra deaths per decade and cause respiratory problems for more than one million people, according to a recent analysis conducted by researchers from Harvard University. That number, however, is likely to be “a major underestimate of the global public health impact,” said Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health.","Air pollution and emissions","Overturned","2.\nLoosened a Clinton-era rule designed to limit toxic emissions from major industrial polluters.\nE.P.A.\n|\nRead more","3.\nDirected agencies to stop using an Obama-era calculation of the “social cost of carbon” that rulemakers used to estimate the long-term economic benefits of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\nExecutive Order\n|\nRead more","4.\nRevoked a 2015 rule that prohibited the use of hydrofluorocarbons – powerful greenhouse gases – as a replacement for ozone-depleting substances.\nE.P.A.\n|\nRead more","5.\nRepealed a requirement that state and regional authorities track tailpipe emissions from vehicles traveling on federal highways.\nTransportation Department\n|\nRead more","6.\nWithdrew guidance for federal agencies to include greenhouse gas emissions in environmental reviews.

{"originalurl":"http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/03/facebook-secretly-saved-videos-users-deleted.html","title":"Facebook Secretly Saved Videos Users Deleted","text":["Ever Record a Video on Facebook? Facebook Still Has It.","Thumbnails from videos a user never posted and believed she had deleted, but that Facebook saved anyway.","Have you downloaded your Facebook data archive yet? Facebook makes it easy to obtain a ZIP file of all the data it has on you: your status updates, your friend list, your messages … and, as I and several people I spoke with were surprised to discover, every video you ever filmed on the platform — including videos you never published.","Cambridge Analytica’s effect on the election is still disputed, but if there’s one thing everyone can agree is true in the wake of the scandal over its data-harvesting, it’s that we’ve paid far too little attention to the scale and scope of the data that Facebook has collected on us over our years of platform use. It’s true that, in most cases, we’ve “consented” to this kind of data-gathering by clicking “okay” on a dense terms-of-service contract, and neglecting to opt out. But given how often the details are ignored, it’s disconcerting to discover exactly what data has been gathered.","Last week, Facebook users around the world discovered that Facebook’s Android app had, in some cases, Hoovered up extensive call data without their awareness. “When this feature is enabled, uploading your contacts also allows us to use information like when a call or text was made or received. This feature does not collect the content of your calls or text messages,” Facebook said, noting that users had to initially opt in to have their communication tracked. But it seems unlikely that many of the people who “opted in” were aware that they’d done so, or what exactly it meant.","And call logs aren’t the only data Facebook’s been holding to user surprise. Earlier this week, like many people around the world, my sister Bailey downloaded her Facebook data archives. Along with the contact lists and relationship statuses was something unexpected: several different videos of her attempting to play a scale on a wooden flute in her childhood bedroom.","Each video, she discovered, was a different “take” — recorded on Facebook, but then, she assumed, discarded before she posted the final version to a friend’s wall. (In the archive, you can infer which video was posted on a wall versus the ones that weren’t based on the comments. Videos that were never published are commentless.) In one of the clips, you can hear Kircher say, exasperatedly, that it is her 13th take. At the end of the clip, which isn’t to her liking, she groans and reaches forward, apparently to delete the video and try again.","Bailey Kircher never posted this video on Facebook, but still found a copy of it in her Facebook archive.","How did this happen? In the pre–Facebook Live era, leaving videos on your friends’ walls was something of a crude FaceTime. You’d post a video, they’d respond with a video, and so forth. Importantly, Facebook had a feature that let users film videos via webcam on Facebook itself — that is, without ever leaving the Facebook site to use a video recorder. Once you were done filming, Facebook would show you a preview of your clip. If you decided to do another take, you could click to discard that video and try it again. Except, the video wasn’t actually deleted. Instead, Facebook apparently saved your unused clip.","Another co-worker, Brittany Stephanis, found over 100 videos in her archive and says that she only ever publicly posted about a third of them. The earliest date back to Christmas Day in 2008 when Stephanis, then 13, started recording videos to wish her friends a happy holiday. Stephanis says that her archive contains videos she clearly never planned to shared with anyone. “There are videos of me just checking my teeth,” she explained. My sister also had videos — rehearsing for school musicals and cheerleading — where she was using Facebook’s desktop camera to review herself and then erase, or so she thought, the video forever.","I thought this was a funny quirk of my sister’s. And then I looked at my own data archive. There, at the bottom of the list of videos I’d put on the platform, I found clips that appear to have never been posted to Facebook but were saved anyway.","From what I can tell, most people haven’t noticed this yet. (Or, possibly, they have and are unperturbed.) One reason might be that the videos are saved in the FLV format, short for Flash Video. Most default video players can’t read them, but you can watch them in VLC. You can’t preview a .flv file in a file browser, which could make it a little trickier to figure out what videos Facebook has of yours. To find yours, download your data archive — instructions here — and open the file. Select the index, which will open your archive in your web browser. From there, click the video section to see what’s what. (You might need to download the free app VLC player, which can play Flash videos.)","Facebook saving data you didn’t share isn’t an entirely new concern. Back in 2013, then–Facebook intern and Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon Sauvik Das and Adam Kramer, a Facebook data scientist, put together a study on what they deemed “self-censorship” on the platform. Self-censorship, according to their work, was anything a user typed in the status box but ultimately didn’t post.Data that Facebook can track. Facebook’s current data policy says that the company can “collect the content and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share, and message or communicate with others.” “Create” is the operative word in there. By that logic, Facebook technically could save any video a user filmed but did not publish because you created it on the platform. Still, that requires the kind of close read of the fine print that most humans, at least not before Facebook’s ongoing Cambridge Analytica privacy fiasco, likely aren’t taking the time to do.","An industry expert recently told me about another “open secret” — that when Instagram first introduced video, the company would begin uploading a user’s video while they wrote a caption. That way, when the user pressed “post,” the video would already be good to go, and the user wouldn’t have to wait while the video uploaded in real time. Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger explained this in a presentation on the “Secrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design” in 2011. It doesn’t seem unreasonable that a similar system might have been used at Facebook to create a faster, cleaner user experience. Except, unlike Instagram which says it threw out the data if a user cancelled the post, it appears Facebook was keeping the videos.","I reached out to Facebook for comment today, and the company asked me to connect them with Kircher so she could consent to the company investigating why these outtakes were in her data archives. The representative told me the company thinks they’ve “gotten to the bottom of it,” but that Facebook was still figuring out what it could share. Later, a Facebook representative provided a statement saying that the company is still looking into the matter: “We’ve heard that when accessing their information from our Download Your Information tool, some people are seeing their old videos that do not appear on their profile or Activity Log. We are investigating.”","The videos that Stephanis and Kircher found in their archives are pretty harmless, at least in terms of content. But it’s easy to imagine a user filming something that wasn’t quite so juvenile and being horrified to discover that Facebook has a copy. Apropos of, well, everything, now seems like a good time to mention that Mark Zuckerberg keeps a piece of tape over his webcam. Seems like he might be onto something.","Update, March 28, 6:16 p.m.: This piece has been edited to include a statement from Facebook.","If you’ve also found questionable things in your Facebook data archive, I’d love to hear about it. Please email me at madison.kircher@nymag.com."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Join this upcoming VB Live event to learn about how the security offered by distributed ledger technologies is transforming businesses from IoT to healthcare and unlocking real ROI in brand new ways.","“I think we’re now just exploring the true opportunity of IoT and how many day-to-day tasks it can handle for us,” says Dawn Barry, co-founder and president of Luna DNA, a community-owned human health database. “The intersection of blockchain and IoT, as I see it, is that where IOT is currently weak is in security and reliability of connections at all times, blockchain is strong.”","Barry points out that blockchain is currently securing the most valuable digital currencies in the world. Its decentralized nature and smart contracts offer powerful new advantages in an IoT ecosystem. Data streaming, security, and more are not crippled by a single point of failure, because you’re leveraging multiple points of connectivity.","“I think such a frictionless, decentralized system has the power to remove information silos and empower consumers to have a greater say in how their data is used and who benefits from it,” she says. “In my mind, the big future goal is to connect blockchain and IoT, to scale security and connectivity, create trust and transparency, and accelerate data exchange and transactions.”","Luna has its eye on IoT as the next step for their database. The company’s aim is to significantly ramp up the amount of data available for scientific research and accelerate new discoveries. Users connect their health data, while the company anonymizes that data by aggregating and organizing it, and makes it available to researchers. Any profit that comes from the sale rolls back to the original research participants. And IoT will be a key component of accelerating the advances in health fueled by this research.","“I predict a world where IOT-facilitated health data collection will occur continuously in the background of our lives,” Barry says. “We can imagine a future where we’re living our lives, seamlessly connected and contributing our life data to research — like nutrition or environmental exposure or physical activity — a future where we’re empowered to donate our digital bodies, so to speak, throughout our lifespan, to scientific research.”","Blockchain can be used to engage the general public as research partners in building a human health database, Barry says. Through blockchain, people can share personal health data, including DNA files, for the benefit of research, with the privacy and security and personal control that blockchain would offer.","She imagines being able to connect wearables and sensor data as part of the monitoring and donation of data, in order to eventually have the human equivalent of predictive analytics and engine checkups, like we do for our cars, so we’re not always just repairing the breakdown, but catching disease before the late stage.","The Luna system is being built to ensure extensibility in a future of wearables, Barry says, and points out that blockchain allows you to create the kind of extremely scalable system that makes that possible as humans continue to become more data-driven and more quantification-oriented — and more interested in connected health devices.","To learn more about the myriad use cases blockchain is unlocking, the potential of a blockchain-powered IoT system and more, don’t miss this VB Live event!"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

But ditching Facebook, whether that means deactivating your profile or deleting it altogether, is easier said than done. Like it or not, that Facebook account also lets you log into other Facebook apps that you may like, including Messenger and Instagram. You’ll also lose access to any friends and family on Facebook who have protected accounts if you completely delete your profile.","Luckily for you, there are ways to #DeleteFacebook without actually deleting your Facebook account — though, that still means Facebook will collect some data and make money off of you.

Remove information from your profile that you don’t want anyone to have access to, including personal information that appears on your profile page, as well as previous likes, check-ins, interests, tags, and whatever else you think should not be shared with Facebook or third parties.

Note: Includes countries with more than 10 million people and at least one mass public shooting with four or more victims.","When the world looks at the United States, it sees a land of exceptions: a time-tested if noisy democracy, a crusader in foreign policy, an exporter of beloved music and film.","But there is one quirk that consistently puzzles America’s fans and critics alike. Why, they ask, does it experience so many mass shootings?","Perhaps, some speculate, it is because American society is unusually violent. Or its racial divisions have frayed the bonds of society. Or its citizens lack proper mental care under a health care system that draws frequent derision abroad.","These explanations share one thing in common: Though seemingly sensible, all have been debunked by research on shootings elsewhere in the world. Instead, an ever-growing body of research consistently reaches the same conclusion.","The only variable that can explain the high rate of mass shootings in America is its astronomical number of guns.","Photo","Outside the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Tex., after a mass shooting on Sunday.Credit\nCallie Richmond for The New York Times","A Look at the Numbers","The top-line numbers suggest a correlation that, on further investigation, grows only clearer.","Americans make up about 4.4 percent of the global population but own 42 percent of the world’s guns. From 1966 to 2012, 31 percent of the gunmen in mass shootings worldwide were American, according to a 2015 study by Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama.","Adjusted for population, only Yemen has a higher rate of mass shootings among countries with more than 10 million people — a distinction Mr. Lankford urged to avoid outliers. Yemen has the world’s second-highest rate of gun ownership after the United States.","The New York Times|Source: Adam Lankford, The University of Alabama (shooters); Small Arms Survey (guns).","Worldwide, Mr. Lankford found, a country’s rate of gun ownership correlated with the odds it would experience a mass shooting. This relationship held even when he excluded the United States, indicating that it could not be explained by some other factor particular to his home country. And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence.","Factors That Don’t Correlate","If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.","A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.","Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.","Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.","A Violent Country","America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.","Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.","Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.","They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.","An investigator among thousands of personal items left behind after a gunman opened fire in Las Vegas last month.Credit\nJohn Locher/Associated Press","Comparisons in Other Societies","Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.","As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.","In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.","By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.","Beyond the Statistics","In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.","This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.","The United States also has some of the weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.","Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.","Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.","Photo","A vigil after the Las Vegas attack.Credit\nHilary Swift for The New York Times","The Difference Is Culture","The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.","The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.","After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting.

Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said last week of rumors of the FTC action, “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”","The controversy has roiled company stock, and the announcement Monday of the federal agency probe sent the company’s stock sliding even further, down nearly four points at its lowest midday trading point.","Cambridge Analytica has previously said it was unaware the data was improperly obtained by a third party, and the firm says it cooperated with Facebook in deleting all the social media company’s data and related information in 2015. Such material was not utilized as part of its work with the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, the data firm said.","The Trump campaign has said it never used data from Cambridge Analytica.\nThe Judiciary Committee, for its part, said it plans to cover “privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use. It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Grassley also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss mounting privacy concerns and “how to develop ‘rules of the road’ that encourage companies to develop tailored approaches to privacy that satisfy consumer expectations while maintaining incentives for innovation.”","Pressure is building for Zuckerberg, in particular, to face what will surely be a series of public grillings, as the list of congressional panels demanding his appearance grows.","Already, the embattled billionaire businessman has received requests from the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has said it intends to extend an invite, as its panel continues its more than 14-month long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.","There are also international demands for Zuckerberg to appear before government panels in the UK, Australia, and beyond.","“On a bipartisan basis, we believe Mr. Zuckerberg’s testimony is necessary to gain a better understanding of how the company plans to restore lost trust, safeguard users’ data, and end a troubling series of belated responses to serious problems,” Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, said last week in a joint statement.","Some in Congress have even begun to threaten regulation of an industry that has long fought against any curb of its activities.","“These tech platforms who are extraordinarily powerful who’ve been great iconic American success stories - they need to be more forthcoming or Washington is going to start imposing rules and regulations that may not fit,” warned Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and, himself, a former tech industry entrepreneur and investor.","Warner, who had just months ago insisted on a “light touch” to try to press Silicon Valley into action, has seemed to grow more frustrated with the tech CEO’s since last year, when Facebook, Google, and Twitter sent their top lawyers – instead of coming themselves – to the Intelligence panel to testify regarding their role in Russia’s 2016 interference.","“Facebook has -since the beginning of this investigation - have been reluctant, to say the least, to be fully forthcoming,” Warner said, adding, “I think it’s time for the CEO, Mr. Zuckerberg, and other top officials to come and testify and not tell part of the story but tell the whole story of their involvement, not only with the Trump campaign but their ability to have their platform misused by the Russians.”","Last Thursday, Facebook sent a handful of senior staff to brief aides to a number of key Senate and House committees on the most recent controversy.","The same panels on both sides of Congress who are demanding that Zuckerberg appear also want to hear from Cambridge Analytica executives, including its now-suspended CEO Alexander Nix and former data firm employee Christopher Wylie. The latter told ABC News that he had already accepted House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence’s invitation.","“One of the reasons why I’m speaking out is because I think that it’s really concerning that no one has really investigated Cambridge Analytica and its role in the 2016 election,” Wylie told ABC News in a recent interview.","Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence panel, also invited Russian-American researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who developed the initial app approved by Facebook to collect data on 227,000 of its users.","Kogan previously told ABC News that Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are making him a “scapegoat.”","ABC News also reported Monday that Government watchdog group Common Cause filed a pair of legal complaints with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the Department of Justice accusing Cambridge Analytica LTD, its parent company SCL Group Limited, CEO Alexander Nix, SCL co-founder Nigel Oakes, data scientist Alexander Tayler, and former employee-turned-whistleblower Christopher Wylie of violating federal election laws that prohibit foreigners from participating directly or indirectly in the decision-making process of U.S. political campaigns."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

Because blockchain technology offers the ability to make digital transactions without having to store or share your data with anyone.","It’s a few days now since the first reports emerged alleging that Cambridge Analytica had harvested Facebook user data. Around the world, the 2.2 billion active Facebook users might well still wonder how safe their personal data is.","Unfortunately, the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica breach demonstrates yet again that traditional, centralized methods of storing personal data are unsafe, and open to unscrupulous attack.","At Nuggets, we store people’s personal data securely on the blockchain. Only the user themselves has access — not even Nuggets can get at the data. That means you can make simple e-commerce payments and other transactions without ever having to share your personal information.","For decades, technologists and entrepreneurs have seen the value of decentralized systems. From early peer-to-peer projects to Bitcoin, we’ve seen the steady growth of protocols and applications built on a decentralized model.","Sadly, Facebook is behind the curve. Not just in its centralized model, but also in the way its supplier services farm data and sell it on for marketing purposes.","Today, blockchain technology represents the latest advance in distributing computational efforts across a network — and we’re just starting to apply it effectively.","That’s what blockchain technology does. At Nuggets, we use “zero-knowledge” technology and encryption to store personal information in the blockchain. The user is the only person who can access the encrypted data, and transactions can be verified without having to share any of the underlying data. Nuggets uses biometrics to identify the user, offering a much more secure method of authentication and making passwords obsolete.","With personal information encrypted in a blockchain, merchants no longer have to ask consumers to hand that data over. That means consumers can stop worrying about their information, and companies are spared the huge headache of trying to protect vast databases of valuable data. It’s a revolutionary solution for everyone involved in digital transactions.","The Facebook breach is a huge and shocking story, but it’s just the latest in a long series of similar stories. Everyone of them shows just how broken the existing model of personal data storage is.","Blockchain technology offers the chance of a genuine paradigm shift in the way we tackle this issue.","Personal data is valuable — extremely valuable.

In fact, Donald Trump probably would have lost to Hillary Clinton had Republican- and Democratic-leaning registered voters cast ballots at equal rates.","Election-year polls understandably focus on likely voters. Then, after the election, the attention turns to actual voters, mainly using exit polls. But getting good data on Americans who didn’t vote is more difficult. That’s why the SurveyMonkey poll, which interviewed about 100,000 registered voters just after Election Day, including more than 3,600 registered voters who didn’t vote, is so useful.1 It’s still just one poll, and so its findings aren’t gospel, but with such a big sample we can drill down to subgroups and measure the demographic makeup of nonvoters to an extent we couldn’t with a smaller dataset.","Let’s look first at the most newsworthy finding: Registered voters who identified as Democrats and independents were more likely than Republicans to stay home.","2016 REGISTERED VOTERS","SELF IDENTIFICATION","SHARE REGISTERED TO VOTE","VOTED IN 2016 ELECTION","DIDN’T VOTE","DIFFERENCE","Democratic","44%","44%","35%","+9","Republican","43","46","32","+14","Neither","13","10","33","-23","Registered voters who didn’t vote were less Republican-leaning","Percentages are rounded. From a survey of 99,377 registered voters and 3,604 registered voters who didn’t vote, conducted from Nov. 9-10, 2016","Source: Surveymonkey","Given how closely party identification tracks with vote choice, the disparity in turnout probably cost Clinton the election. SurveyMonkey did not ask non-voters whom they would have voted for, but we do know that more than 90 percent of self-identified Democrats who cast a ballot voted for Clinton and more than 90 percent of Republicans voted for Trump. Moreover, voters who didn’t identify with or lean towards either party were slightly more likely to prefer Clinton to Trump. That means that had the non-voters cast a ballot in accordance with their party identification, Clinton’s advantage over Trump nationally would have expanded by about 2 to 3 percentage points. That almost certainly would have been enough to flip enough states for her to win the Electoral College.","The large gap in party identification between registered voters who cast a ballot and those who didn’t also helps to explain why pre-election polling underestimated Trump. Pre-election polls suggested that the gap between these two groups would be smaller than in 2012; the SurveyMonkey data suggests it was larger.","The biggest reason given by non-voters for staying home was that they didn’t like the candidates.2 Clinton and Trump both had favorable ratings in the low 30s among registered voters who didn’t cast a ballot — both had ratings in the low 40s among those who did vote. That’s a pretty sizable difference. So why was Clinton hurt more by non-voters? Trump was able to win, in large part, because voters who disliked both candidates favored him in big numbers, according to the exit polls. Clinton, apparently, couldn’t get those who disliked both candidates — and who may have been more favorably disposed to her candidacy — to turn out and vote.","The second pattern that jumps out in the SurveyMonkey data: Non-white and Hispanic Americans were more likely to stay home than white voters.","Of all voters who cast a ballot in the general election, 25 percent were black, Hispanic, Asian, or a member of another minority group. But those voters were 42 percent of those who didn’t vote. Drilling down a little further, black voters made up 11 percent of voters who cast a ballot and 19 percent who didn’t. This disparity really hurt Clinton because black voters (by 82 percentage points) and Hispanic voters (by 40 percentage points) overwhelmingly favored her, while white voters went for Trump by a 16-point margin in the SurveyMonkey poll.","The turnout rate for black voters was substantially higher in 2012, the last time Barack Obama was on the ballot. According to the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey,3 black Americans made up 13 percent of voters and only 9 percent of registered non-voters in 2012. In other words, black voters actually made up a larger percentage of voters who cast a ballot than those who didn’t in 2012, which is the opposite of what occurred last year. Whites, on the other hand, made up about the same percentage of registered voters who cast a ballot (74 percent) and those who didn’t (73 percent). The higher number of black non-voters in 2016 probably had a big impact.","Next up: Younger voters were more likely to stay home than older voters.","That matches a similar pattern from 2012, according to the Current Population Survey. That probably didn’t help Clinton, but it’s not as harmful as you might think because the difference in voting patterns between the oldest age cohort (a group Trump won by 12 percentage points in the SurveyMonkey data) and youngest (a group Clinton won by 30 percentage points) voters isn’t as large as it is between racial groups. Overall, the age breakdown of 2016 voters looks about the same as four years ago.","More harmful for Clinton was which young voters stayed home: minorities. Among white voters, voters 18-29 years old made up 30 percent of voters who did not participate in the November election. Among young Hispanic voters, that climbs to 43 percent. Among young black voters, it was an even higher 46 percent. That generally matches the findings of the voter data released in some Southern states showing that young black voters were especially likely to stay home in this election. Younger black voters were far more likely to support Bernie Sanders in the primary, suggesting that there simply was not the enthusiasm for Clinton’s candidacy as there was for Obama’s in 2012. Clinton’s favorable rating, for instance, was about 10 percentage points lower among the youngest black voters compared to the oldest black voters in the SurveyMonkey poll.","Perhaps most important is the group that voted in much larger numbers than in 2012: white voters without a college degree. (Trump won this bloc 63 percent to 32 percent.) Generally speaking, college graduates are more likely to vote than non-college graduates, even when controlling for race. According to the Current Population Survey, whites without a college degree made up 44 percent of voters who cast a ballot in 2012, and 58 percent of registered voters who didn’t vote.","These may have been some of the “missing” white voters that RealClearPolitics Sean Trende has written about, but in 2016, they weren’t missing. In the SurveyMonkey data, white non-college graduates made up 48 percent of 2016 registered voters who didn’t vote, substantially lower than 2012. They made up 47 percent of voters. It’s pretty remarkable that a group of voters that is shrinking as a percentage of the population made up a larger share of the electorate in 2016 than in 2012. But Trump made a clear appeal to this group, and some voters who stayed at home in previous years may have felt they had a greater voice in 2016.","Simply put, Trump got more of his voters to turn out than Clinton did. That’s quite a turnaround from the pre-election conventional wisdom that the Clinton campaign had the better turnout machine. Of course, Clinton’s turnout operation may well have nudged many reluctant voters to the polls, but either way, it wasn’t enough. The polling numbers from SurveyMonkey indicate that Clinton was hurt dearly by the voters who decided not to vote.","Footnotes","The interviews took place on Nov. 9 and Nov. 10. SurveyMonkey also interviewed Americans who were not registered to vote, but I’m focusing on registered voters here. We’ll have a follow-up on non-registered non-voters.","There are, of course, a lot of reasons people don’t vote. In addition to not liking their choices, some people don’t have the time to vote (they can’t get off work, for example). Others are dissuaded or prevented from voting by barriers like voter identification laws."],"isopubdate":"2017-01-05"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Bush and Barack Obama have periodically renewed the DED status, but Trump has now decided to allow it to expire, deeming Liberia safe for returnees.","Trump has taken a tough stance on immigration in general and, in reported private conversations, an even tougher stance on Africans from what he has reportedly deemed “shithole countries.”","The latest grace period expires on March 31, but Trump said in a letter to the Department of Homeland Security that he would accord the Liberians a 12-month “wind-down” period to prepare their departure.","“Through consultation with appropriate executive departments and agencies and my advisors, I have been informed that conditions in Liberia have improved,” Trump wrote.","“Liberia is no longer experiencing armed conflict and has made significant progress in restoring stability and democratic governance,” he argued.","Trump admitted that the 2014 outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa had brought “tragic loss of life and economic damage” to Liberia, one of the world’s poorest countries after years of civil war.","But he declared himself satisfied with Liberia’s progress in tackling the disease.","It is not clear how many of the original 10,000 DED recipients may have died, moved on voluntarily or been granted another form of legal US residency — but the rest face an uncertain future.","Opponents of Trump’s move warned it would uproot many who had made new and productive lives for themselves in the United States.","Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, noted on Twitter that, thanks to the previous presidents’ DED extensions, the Liberians had been living in the United States legally since 1992.","“Many work in Minnesota hospitals and nursing homes,” she wrote. “I won’t give up this fight. We have a year.”"],"isopubdate":""}

Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said last week of rumors of the FTC action, “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”","The controversy has roiled company stock, and the announcement Monday of the federal agency probe sent the company’s stock sliding even further, down nearly four points at its lowest midday trading point.","Cambridge Analytica has previously said it was unaware the data was improperly obtained by a third party, and the firm says it cooperated with Facebook in deleting all the social media company’s data and related information in 2015. Such material was not utilized as part of its work with the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, the data firm said.","The Trump campaign has said it never used data from Cambridge Analytica. The Judiciary Committee, for its part, said it plans to cover “privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use. It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Grassley also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss mounting privacy concerns and “how to develop ‘rules of the road’ that encourage companies to develop tailored approaches to privacy that satisfy consumer expectations while maintaining incentives for innovation.”","Pressure is building for Zuckerberg, in particular, to face what will surely be a series of public grillings, as the list of congressional panels demanding his appearance grows.","Already, the embattled billionaire businessman has received requests from the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has said it intends to extend an invite, as its panel continues its more than 14-month long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.","There are also international demands for Zuckerberg to appear before government panels in the UK, Australia, and beyond.","“On a bipartisan basis, we believe Mr. Zuckerberg’s testimony is necessary to gain a better understanding of how the company plans to restore lost trust, safeguard users’ data, and end a troubling series of belated responses to serious problems,” Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, said last week in a joint statement.","Some in Congress have even begun to threaten regulation of an industry that has long fought against any curb of its activities.","“These tech platforms who are extraordinarily powerful who’ve been great iconic American success stories - they need to be more forthcoming or Washington is going to start imposing rules and regulations that may not fit,” warned Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and, himself, a former tech industry entrepreneur and investor.","Warner, who had just months ago insisted on a “light touch” to try to press Silicon Valley into action, has seemed to grow more frustrated with the tech CEO’s since last year, when Facebook, Google, and Twitter sent their top lawyers – instead of coming themselves – to the Intelligence panel to testify regarding their role in Russia’s 2016 interference.","“Facebook has -since the beginning of this investigation - have been reluctant, to say the least, to be fully forthcoming,” Warner said, adding, “I think it’s time for the CEO, Mr. Zuckerberg, and other top officials to come and testify and not tell part of the story but tell the whole story of their involvement, not only with the Trump campaign but their ability to have their platform misused by the Russians.”","Last Thursday, Facebook sent a handful of senior staff to brief aides to a number of key Senate and House committees on the most recent controversy.","The same panels on both sides of Congress who are demanding that Zuckerberg appear also want to hear from Cambridge Analytica executives, including its now-suspended CEO Alexander Nix and former data firm employee Christopher Wylie. The latter told ABC News that he had already accepted House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence’s invitation.","“One of the reasons why I’m speaking out is because I think that it’s really concerning that no one has really investigated Cambridge Analytica and its role in the 2016 election,” Wylie told ABC News in a recent interview.","Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence panel, also invited Russian-American researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who developed the initial app approved by Facebook to collect data on 227,000 of its users.","Kogan previously told ABC News that Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are making him a “scapegoat.”","ABC News also reported Monday that Government watchdog group Common Cause filed a pair of legal complaints with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the Department of Justice accusing Cambridge Analytica LTD, its parent company SCL Group Limited, CEO Alexander Nix, SCL co-founder Nigel Oakes, data scientist Alexander Tayler, and former employee-turned-whistleblower Christopher Wylie of violating federal election laws that prohibit foreigners from participating directly or indirectly in the decision-making process of U.S. political campaigns.","Online Public Information File","Viewers with disabilities can get assistance accessing this station's FCC Public Inspection File by contacting the station with the information listed below.

(credit: Jason Alden/Bloomberg via Getty Images)","In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations regarding the exposure of profile data for millions of users, Facebook is now facing an investigation into its data-collection practices by the Federal Trade Commission. In a statement issued on March 26, FTC Consumer Protection Bureau Acting Director Tom Pahl said that the FTC “takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","The FTC investigation will likely focus on what data Facebook shares with third parties. But third parties aren’t the only entity hoping to win “friends” and influence people on this social platform. Facebook collects a great deal of information about users for use by its internal algorithms. Those algorithms govern who and what users see, whom they get recommended to “friend,” and other aspects of how our Facebook experiences are subtly (or sometimes not-so-subtly) shaped by advertisers and others leveraging the platform.","As Ars reported, Facebook has pushed users to allow access to SMS messages and call logs with its Messenger and Facebook Lite applications under the auspices of providing a service. “Keep up with all your conversations in one place” by using the app as the default SMS application on Android phones, Facebook offers. Previous versions of the Facebook mobile app on Android (in versions of Android prior to 4.1) were able to read SMS and call logs simply by asking for access to contacts, which Facebook has described as standard practice for applications. This allowed Facebook to keep track of the time, length, and contact information for any call made or received by the Android device by uploading it to Facebook’s data centers. Facebook could also access metadata about text and multimedia messages sent via SMS."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has strongly opposed the legislation, listed several consequences of the bill, which it called “far-reaching” and “privacy-upending”:","Enable foreign police to collect and wiretap people’s communications from U.S. companies, without obtaining a U.S. warrant.","Allow foreign nations to demand personal data stored in the United States, without prior review by a judge.","Allow the U.S. president to enter “executive agreements” that empower police in foreign nations that have weaker privacy laws than the United States to seize data in the United States while ignoring U.S. privacy laws.","Allow foreign police to collect someone’s data without notifying them about it.","Empower U.S. police to grab any data, regardless if it’s a U.S. person’s or not, no matter where it is stored.","The bill is an update to the current MLAT (Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty), the current framework for sharing internet user data between countries, which both legislators and tech companies have criticized as inefficient.","Some tech companies, like Microsoft, have endorsed the new CLOUD policy. Brad Smith, the company’s president and chief legal officer, called it “a strong statute and a good compromise,” that “gives tech companies like Microsoft the ability to stand up for the privacy rights of our customers around the world.”","They echoed the sentiment of lawmakers like Orrin Hatch (R-UT). In February, he said of the bill:","“The CLOUD Act bridges the divide that sometimes exists between law enforcement and the tech sector by giving law enforcement the tools it needs to access data throughout the world while at the same time creating a commonsense framework to encourage international cooperation to resolve conflicts of law.”","One of the biggest complaints from privacy advocates, however, is that the new legislation places too much unmitigated power in the hands of governments with abysmal human rights records while also giving too much discretion to the U.S. government’s executive branch. Noting that the executive branch will decide which countries are human rights compliant and that those countries will then be able to engage in data collection and wiretaps without any further restrictions or oversight, the ACLU warned:","“Flip through Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch’s recent annual reports, and you can find a dizzying array of countries that have ratified major human rights treaties and reflect those obligations in their domestic laws but, in fact, have arrested, tortured and killed people in retaliation for their activism or due to their identity.”","The organization pointed out that no human rights organizations have endorsed the CLOUD Act, adding that “in the case of countries certified by the executive branch, the CLOUD Act would not require the U.S. government to scrutinize data requests by the foreign governments — indeed, the bill would not even require notifying the U.S. government or a user regarding a request.”","Further, the ACLU says, if a foreign government’s human rights record deteriorates, there is no mechanism to revoke its access to data. Considering the U.S.’ existing record on supporting regimes that severely restrict basic rights like freedom of expression, the expanded access the CLOUD Act provides is undoubtedly worrisome.","Also predictable is the government’s stale justification for expanding its power. As the CLOUD Act claims, it is purportedly to “protect public safety and combat serious crime, including terrorism” — even if it further empowers governments that support and commit said terrorism.","In an age where the government already engages in mass surveillance and is eager to disable the people’s efforts to protect their privacy through encryption technology, it is unsurprising, albeit dangerous, that Congress continues to encroach on what little is left of safeguards against unwarranted intrusions.","…We have a small favor to ask. Fewer and fewer people are seeing Anti-Media articles as social media sites crack down on us, and advertising revenues across the board are quickly declining.

His attorney, Tamsin Allen, said in a statement early Sunday that when Facebook became aware of the articles about to published about data harvesting at the social media giant, the company \"privately welcomed\" his help -- and then publicly suspended his account.","Facebook announced Friday night that it had suspended Wylie along with a researcher at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan and the consulting company Strategic Communication Laboratories -- the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. In the release about the suspension, Facebook said Kogan had passed along data harvested from a digital app to Cambridge Analytica and Wylie and lied to Facebook about deleting the data.","Facebook's release about the suspensions came just hours before exposés about the company's practices were published in The New York Times and the Guardian. Wylie spoke to both outlets, saying he and Kogan \"exploited\" Facebook.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles,\" Wylie told the Guardian. \"And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"","According to the Guardian, data was harvested from 50 million profiles and Facebook failed to inform uses and did little to recover the data. Although only 270,000 downloaded Kogan's app, there was a loophole at Facebook at the time that allowed app developers to not only see the data of people who downloaded the app but also everyone in that user's friend network, Wired senior reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN Saturday.","Wylie's attorney, Tamsin Allen, said in a statement when Facebook learned about the articles, the company \"privately welcomed\" his help but then criticized him publicly and suspended his account.","\"This behavior is more consistent with damage limitation than with a genuine attempt to resolve a serious problem,\" Allen said. \"None of this would have been revealed without Mr Wylie speaking out and taking his share of responsibility. Facebook should be doing the same rather than simply blaming others.\"","A Facebook spokesperson has since responded saying: \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account.

Over the last few years (Tracy says) her husband has transformed from a “Conservative in the Reagan model” to a far-right Donald Trump supporter.","“Politics was not a big deal in our marriage, it wasn’t that big of a deal until the last two years,” Tracy says. She and her husband met 48 years ago, both aged 11, and have been married for over three decades. Last week, Tracy went viral (42,000 likes, 11,000 retweets) for a tweet that read:","“This is hard to write... My husband of 33 years, a Veteran, was changed from a Conservative into an extreme alt-right crazy. Who is to blame? FUCKING FACEBOOK! Constant Clickbait. I feel like I’m married to a stranger.”","It’s a compelling and straight-forward narrative, one that promises to show the real lives behind the data. As an older white man who is Conservative, Christian and a veteran, Tracy’s husband Brandon was arguably prime for targeting – but there is no way of knowing if he was actually one of those targeted with Cambridge Analytica’s pro-Trump ads. It is possible he was instead targeted by fake news websites run by teenagers trying to make quick cash or Russians trying to meddle in elections. It is possible he wasn’t targeted at all.","Regardless, Tracy believes “shocking” fake news stories (she gives the made-up example of “Eight Muslim Men Raped A Three-Year-Old Girl and Threw Her Off A Bridge”) changed her husband.","“He started posting these stories that were just crazy, they were crazy,” she tells me, giving another example of a news story claiming Barack Obama is not an American citizen. “If you look at the source or you look at any other information, they were just false.” She believes stories about crimes by immigrants and Muslims appealed to the “hero” in men like Brandon.","“I don’t think he’s stupid in any way, he’s very smart, and he’s very kind and compassionate,” she says of her husband (whom she still loves, she reiterates multiple times), “but these stories, they develop something in these men. It made them believe things that were just patently false, and it changed their personalities dramatically.”","On Facebook, Brandon “Likes” the fake news websitesConservative 101 and American News, as well as the website Tell Me Now, which once ran an article headlined “Pope Benedict XVI Forbids Catholics From Voting for Hillary!”","“I can show him absolute positive proof that something is wrong and he will still believe it,” Tracy says.","“I think he has been selectively targeted and led to believe this stuff and I think it was a brilliant plan by whoever did it, because it worked.”","Brandon, however, disagrees.","***","“To buy into the narrative that I was brainwashed by Facebook,” Brandon laughs, “I don’t think so, but you know I’m a proud person.”","Brandon, 57, thinks Facebook “made [him] more aware of certain things” that in turn changed his politics over the last few years, though he explains he’s “been a Conservative all along”.","“Most of it has to do with the Democratic Party and the illegal things they do,” he says, branding Hillary and Bill Clinton “the most corrupt people”. He explains his belief that the FBI are complicit in covering up crimes by the Democratic Party, many of whom he says will go to jail.","When Brandon was younger, he voted for Bill Clinton. He says he is not a “rabid” Trump supporter, and when we talk says he would be “extremely disappointed” if the president passed Congress’ $1.3 trillion spending bill, which he since has.","“I see articles on Facebook but I do other research other than just [looking on] Facebook and taking everything as true,” he explains.","This advert was targeted towards people in swing states, which means Brandon probably did not see it. Despite the volume of Facebook targeting during the 2016 United States election, it is possible Brandon was never targeted at all. Yet Tracy's belief that he was reveals a lot about the current state of the world.","Before Cambridge Analytica dominated the news, many feared that social media helped spread post-truth fake news. Before that, people feared that online echo chambers made our politics more extreme. Even without any underhand action by shady social media manipulators, the Des Combes’ story demonstrates how social media has divided us. Brandon denies being far-right, as Tracy claimed in her initial tweet, but refers to his wife as “far-left”. In the Brexit and Trump era of politics, we come to see our opposition as extremists.","Yet although Brandon doesn’t believe he was targeted on Facebook in a way that changed his politics, he does believe that others could be.","“To give you an example, I was Google searching chicken coops, because we have some chickens, and within 48 hours I’ve got Facebook advertising for chicken coops,” he says. He believes this type of targeted advertising could work similarly for political stories, even if it didn’t in his case.","Recently-leaked Cambridge Analytica documents reveal that the company used paid-for ads on Google to push pro-Trump and anti-Clinton search results in a technique called “persuasion search advertising”. A search for “Trump Iraq War”, for example, would bring up a top result that read: “Hillary Voted for the Iraq War – Donald Trump opposed it”.","***","When Tracy went viral, some argued her story was too convenient. Are Cambridge Analytica, Facebook targeting, fake news, and echo chambers just easy excuses for family members we find disagreeable? In the 2016 documentary The Brainwashing of My Dad, filmmaker Jen Senko claims the media transformed her father from a Democrat into a Republican. Is it too convenient? Doesn’t the ability to be “brainwashed” rely on a willingness to believe?","“I don’t understand where this came from because I’ve been with this man for 33 years and he wasn’t like this before,” Tracy says in response to these critics. “I really want you to understand that I love my husband very much. He is an incredible guy. I truly believe that this happened to him because of targeted clickbait.”","Brandon and Tracy","The real story here, then, is perhaps of marriages divided in the Trump era. Tracy says the response to her viral tweet has been “outrageous”, with many women messaging her to say they have left or are leaving their husbands due to a newfound political divide. “It's the exact same at my house. My husband fell for all the misinformation out there. We dont talk about anything anymore. I truly feel your pain,” reads one public reply to her tweet.","Tracy says she and Brandon have had “a million horrific fights” about politics over the last few years, and now they try to avoid the topic completely.","“It’s just tragic,” she says. “We just can't talk about politics.” Instead, the couple now talk to like-minded others online.","Brandon has Facebook and doesn’t use Twitter. Tracy uses Twitter, and has “quit” Facebook.","Amelia Tait is features editor at Shortlist.com, she was previously the New Statesman's tech and digital culture writer, and tweets at @ameliargh."],"isopubdate":""}

WhatsApp founder Brian Acton, whom Facebook made into a billionaire by acquiring his company tweeted, simply and ominously: “It is time. #deletefacebook”. Elon Musk followed suit by deleting the Tesla and SpaceX Facebook pages. The company has lost over $50 Billion in valuation since last week, albeit against the backdrop of a possibly overtired bull market in stocks in general finally starting to roll over.","There’s so much ground to cover around the implications of the Facebook data sharing scandal and the historical abuses of that platform that I found it necessary to write a separate post about it. Go here to read it.","Apologists lament “it was bound to happen” and the Kool-Aid drinkers enthuse a few lives lost now are worth it given how many lives will be saved by autonomous cars in the future. A spokesperson for Uber tweeted about it as if it happened to a professional stunt driver who “knew the risks” and not some completely unrelated woman who was simply trying to walk her bike across a road, but it’s happened. An Uber self-driving car that was being live tested in real world Arizona has killed a pedestrian.","“The implication is that self driving cars might kill slightly fewer people so that’s good. I think that self driving vehicles shouldn’t kill anyone -especially as part of a beta test. That would be progress.”","Following on a theme of rapacious data harvesting in the spirit of the seminal John Perkins book “Confessions of an Economic Hit Man” (if you haven’t ever read it, get it and read it), “The Dark Side Of Data” was written by somebody who was “uncomfortably close” to the underworld data brokers and scrapers. He describes the three big sins of data mining: #1) data leakage #2) aggregation & de-anonymization which finally leads to #3) psychographic profiling.","I’ll admit I haven’t been following the US “CLOUD Act” (“Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act”) too closely, until now. The earlier legislation was stalled in the Senate, it provides rules for US authorities to obtain US citizens’ data stored anywhere else in the world, provided a US judge issues a subpoena. What happens next depends on the entity housing the data, and the jurisdiction involved. The US tried this against Microsoft for data stored in Ireland and given that Microsoft has deeper pockets than most, a legal battle ensued.","The framework also provides for the US to enter into bilateral agreements with foreign governments to end-run these legal battles and facilitate data handover. I mention all this because that spending bill that just passed last week, thus avoiding another government shutdown, snuck the provisions of the CLOUD Act in on page 2,201 (the entire bill is 2,232 pages long, came out on Wednesday night, and was passed the next day).","As we’ve been following here (mainly through University of Ottawa Law prof Michael Geist’s commentary on it), Bell Canada continues to advance its Orwellian flavoured “Fair for Canada” initiative, dubbed “FairPlay”; where “fair play” includes elements of warrantless web blocking, violation of true net neutrality and threats to human rights norms.","It is quizzical then, that contrary to what most publicly funded broadcasters are doing (usually joining coalitions to fight against censorship and web blocking), the CBC has thrown in with Bell to get behind “FairPlay”.","Atlanta, Georgia (Love that town…“Too busy to hate”) has found its municipal computer systems severely impacted by a ransomware attack. The perpetrators have sent a ransomware note demanding roughly $50,000 payable in bitcoin for the decryption keys.","Reader Interactions","Comments","Yes, you should delete your facebook page. (Betteridge’s law of headlines does not apply in this case.)","Why is the CBC supporting Bell’s “FairPlay”? Well, just have a look at the comment moderation service they use (icuc.social), its owners and senior staff and their politics. Then look at how ICUC was acquired by Dentsu Aegis Network (a Japanese global PR firm). Also look at Dentsu’s pattern of acquisitions over the years. Conflict of interest anyone? Our national broadcaster’s website comments (and thus public perception of articles) are controlled by a foreign public relations firm.

(and check what it blocks here too…).","EasyDNS should maintain its position as a role model and continue stand up for Canadian internet sovereignty.","I believe that deleting, or “censoring” your page makes sense.

Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged.","Acxiom said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March. The company currently expects revenue in the range of $910 million to $915 million in the 2018 fiscal year.","Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said.","Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users’ anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation.","Facebook’s shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook’s lifeblood, and lead to tougher regulation.","Figurines are seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018.

But Cambridge Analytica shouldn’t act as a diversion from the real bad guy in this story: Facebook. It is mystifying that as his company regulates the flow of information to billions of human beings, encouraging certain purchasing habits and opinions, and monitoring people’s interactions, Mark Zuckerberg is invited to give lectures at Harvard without being treated with due scepticism.","We have now reached the point where an unaccountable private corporation is holding detailed data on over a quarter of the world’s population. Zuckerberg and his company have been avoiding responsibility for some time. Governments everywhere need to get serious in how they deal with Facebook.","After trolls were sent to jail for sending threatening messages to the activist Caroline Criado-Perez and MP Stella Creasy, a debate ensued over whether the likes of Facebook and Twitter should be classified as platforms or publishers. Facebook is treated as if it is simply a conduit for information, meaning it is not liable for the content its users share – in the same way that BT can’t be sued when people make threatening phone calls.","In 2014 Iain MacKenzie, a spokesperson for Facebook, said, “Every piece of content on Facebook has an associated ‘report’ option that escalates it to your user operations team for review. Additionally, individuals can block anyone who is harassing them, ensuring they will be unable to interact further. Facebook tackles malicious behaviour through a combination of social mechanisms and technological solutions appropriate for a mass-scale online opportunity.”","But the company is evasive about the number of moderators it employs, how they work, and how decisions are made. It has started taking a firmer line on far-right content – recently removing Britain First pages from the site – but it is still resisting many legislative attempts to regulate its content. What content users then see is decided by an algorithm that can change without any consultation, including with the government or the businesses that rely on Facebook for revenue – meaning that some can be quickly wiped off the map. In February 2018 the website Digiday reported on LittleThings, a four-year-old site that shut down overnight after Facebook decided to prioritise user posts over publisher content. A hundred jobs were lost.","Facebook wasn’t the only contributor to LittleThings’ demise, but those working at the website said there was nowhere else to go after the algorithm change. And this isn’t the only example: in 2013 an algorithm change halved the traffic of viral content website Upworthy – something from which the website has never recovered.","The impact of Facebook’s dominance means that publications are constantly scrambling to keep up with the platform’s changing strategy. The editor-in-chief of Wired, Nick Thompson, recently told the Digiday podcast that there was a fear “Facebook has a dial somewhere that can be turned to cut off media that gets too uppity”.","Much has been made of the fact that Facebook creates “filter bubbles”. It has been criticised for prioritising content that users will like – meaning there is less diversity in the news stories people read – and for failing to crack down on propaganda. In fact, Italy’s new far-right star Matteo Salvini explicitly thanked Facebook for contributing to the country’s recent election results.","All this from a company that in 2016 paid just £5.1m in corporation tax on its UK operations, despite profit and revenues nearly quadrupling on the back of increased advertising sales. In December 2017, Facebook announced it would start booking advertising revenue in countries where it was earned, instead of rerouting it via Ireland, although – as this newspaper reported – the move is “unlikely to result in it paying much more tax”. This is despite Zuckerberg calling for governments to start paying a universal basic income for every citizen as a response to automation, driven in part by Silicon Valley.","Even if we want to avoid the site and keep our data protected, it’s not as easy as one might think. According to Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook, the company uses techniques found in propaganda and casino gambling to foster psychological addiction in its users – such as constant notifications and variable rewards. By keeping us hooked, Facebook is able to hold a huge amount of data on us. What is surprising, and worrying, is the derived data Facebook has – the profiles it can build of its users based on seemingly innocuous information. The author of the book Networks of Control, Wolfie Christl, noted that a patent published by Facebook works out people’s commute times by using location data from mobile apps. It then uses this and other data to segregate users into social classes.","Facebook’s massive data cache goes hand in hand with its acquisition of competitors. Nick Srnicek, author of Platform Capitalism, says, “Facebook is acting like a classic monopoly: it’s buying up competitors like Instagram, it’s blatantly copying rivals like Snapchat, and it even has its own app, Onavo, that acts to warn them of potential threats. All of this is combined with an unchecked sweeping up of our data that’s being used to build an impervious moat around its business.”","If ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence. So perhaps it’s time to start treating Facebook as the giant multinational corporation it is – especially because people with Facebook profiles aren’t the company’s customers: they are the product it sells to advertisers."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Photo: AP","New Delhi: Cautioning internet users against online data thieves in the wake of the recent Facebook data breach revelations, the Indian cyber security agency has advised them to desist from sharing their vote preferences and Aadhaar details on social media platforms.","The computer emergency response team of India (CERT-In), the country’s nodal agency to combat hacking and phishing and mandated to fortify the country’s internet domain security, has issued an advisory asking Facebook and other social media users “not to share their personally identifiable information (PII) or personal information (PI) on these sites or apps (mobile applications).” “Users should not share official data or personal secrets on social media messaging platforms,” said CERT-In.","“The social media users should never share details like their vote preferences, PIN, passwords, credit card details, banking details, passport details, Aadhaar card details and all other details which are meant to be kept secret for personal safety and security,” said the CERT-In advisory accessed by PTI.","The CERT-In specified that the advisory was being issued for the internet and social media users in the country in the backdrop of the recent Facebook users’ data compromises. “Facebook admitted there has been a data breach as the personal data tracked was used by various external parties for unauthorised activities. “In the wake of this development, the users are advised to take diligent measures to safeguard their personal data,” it said.","The information and technology ministry has last week asked Cambridge Analytica, the firm allegedly at the centre of Facebook data breach scandal, to furnish a list of clients and the source of data it had collected from India. The notice came after reports that political parties had used the data analytics firm during elections. The cyber security sleuths’ organisation said the users of the cyberspace should stick to the “best practices” like non-posting of private information and non-disclosure of an individual’s location. “Facebook being part of a public network could allow easy access to information which should not be disclosed,” it said.","The advisory also suggested some more dos and don’ts and advised the users that in case of a data breach, they should immediately approach the help desk of the concerned social media platform and also lodge a complaint with the cyber wing of the police. It suggested social media users against letting unknown or unverified applications access their Facebook account. It also asked them to be diligent in giving permission to the third party apps that can access their public profile which includes name, profile pictures, username, user ID (account number), friends list, gender, age range and location.","“Do not open messages/images received from untrusted sources or received unexpectedly from trusted sources and use strong account-specific passwords, use a mix of different types of characters to make the password harder to crack,” it suggested. It advised that internet users should “close” dormant accounts as they could be compromised without the users knowledge.","“Assess the applications being used in your mobile devices or browsers as most of the applications either use Facebook or Google to sign in. “Also, keep all the mobile apps updated and update the security settings on social networks regularly,” it said.","The IT ministry notice to the overseas data analytics firm had come days after Law and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad warned the social media giant Facebook of stringent action for any attempt to influence polls through data theft. Prasad had even threatened to summon its CEO Mark Zuckerberg, if needed."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

That means that around 300,000 people could sign up for a personality test quiz, and in the process hand over information of 150 times that number.","Now, however, Facebook apps are only allowed to gather information from users who have directly signed up for them, greatly limiting their reach. That change was made in 2014, and rolled out to every Facebook app over the course of 2015.","But it’s still the case that apps which you have directly enabled can harvest a significant amount of data from your account – often information which you might be surprised to know you’re handing over.","The app settings page on Facebook is the place to manage the apps you’ve given access to. Clicking on the link will bring up a list of apps under “logged in with Facebook”. Hopefully you’ll recognise most of them – if there’s any you don’t, consider clicking the “X”, deauthorising them from your account.","No one can pretend Facebook is just harmless fun any more | Ellie Mae O’Hagan","Read more","You might also want to click on the edit button under the “apps others use” heading lower down the page. This takes you to your privacy settings for the modern version of the same feature Cambridge Analytica profited from. The information others can hand over on your behalf is limited, but still includes data such as your date of birth, religious and political views, and activities, interests and things you like. Consider unchecking all the boxes. According to Facebook, leaving them all checked will make your friends’ “experience better and more social”, which doesn’t seem like a good trade-off for you.","If that’s not enough for you to feel safe, maybe now’s the time to delete your Facebook account altogether.","That’s somewhat harder to do. If you go through the account settings, Facebook will attempt to push you to “deactivate” your account, which “will disable your profile and remove your name and photo from most things that you’ve shared on Facebook”. Notably, it won’t remove any of your data from Facebook’s servers, and your account lies dormant hoping you will change your mind.","If you actually want to delete your information from Facebook, the real setting is hidden in a help document with the title “how do I permanently delete my account?” Clicking on “let us know” on that page will take users to the real account deletion screen. Clicking “delete my account” will take you to another screen. Filling in your password and proving you aren’t a robot on that screen will finally… deactivate your account. Wait two weeks after that, and then, at long last, Facebook will begin the 90 day process of deleting all your data from the site."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — probably in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a statement.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”","Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended from its service the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 ­required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ­decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","Facebook said in a statement Saturday: “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown University law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC’s privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree.","She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook’s reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook’s actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,” Rich said. “They could also constitute violations of both U.S. and E.U. laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) also criticized Facebook on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Rubio said.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The thing is, with most of the online services we use today, our data aren’t safe. From the moment you decide to share something online, a message, a photo, …., with someone or a group of people, it goes through servers.

For all the day to day services you use on your mobile or computer, you can increase the safety of your data and recover the control of them.","Messaging","The messaging app Telegram was a game changer when they launched end to end encryption. This means that all the messages you share with your friends are encrypted with a specific key when they leave your phone. Messages are not understandable when they reach servers to be redistributed to the people you addressed the messages.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates.","A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information - including the names of users, their \"likes,\" friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook is suspending the Trump -affiliated data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, after learning that it failed to delete data that it had taken inappropriately from users of the social network, Facebook said late Friday.","Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication...","Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work - including a former Cambridge Analytica employee - said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions.","The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates.","Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what \"like\" buttons they had hit.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning.","Despite Facebook's concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump's digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user-experience researcher, according to Facebook's public website.","Some critics said Facebook's actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump's campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Cambridge Analytica - which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president's former senior adviser Stephen Bannon - has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its \"psychometric profiles\" could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","The company's actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections.","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy, D, said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data \"may have been illegally acquired and used.\"","The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. \"It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\" Denham said in a statement.","Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 EU referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee which is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit group.","Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook's processes for dealing with developers who broke the company's rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules - usually because of a story in the news - the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said.","Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers.","Facebook \"relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,\" Parakilas said. \"During my 16 months at the company, I don't recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.\"","Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.","\"Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook's actions on Saturday, including if they ran afoul of their 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of their agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","In a statement, Facebook said \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry in to U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge's \"psychographic targeting\" techniques - including its use of Facebook data - with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of the Cambridge work.","The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers' likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time.","Cambridge's work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm's data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped.","Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign's data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump's strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.","SCL, Cambridge's parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in \"soft power,\" or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air.","Among its clients: NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russia's influence in the region.","SCL's main offering, first developed by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audience's values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of \"persuadables,\" and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting.","In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCL's defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the company's techniques is that it \"can be undertaken covertly.\"","\"Audience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and government's role and/or third parties can be invisible,\" he wrote."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Cambridge Analytica was looking for people who were American Facebook users. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz app on Facebook called thisisyourdigitallife.","About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app “scraped” information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends’ profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica.","A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn’t installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.","This weekend, after this was all exposed by The New York Times and The Observer of London, Facebook hastily made a public announcement that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica (well over a year after the election) and vehemently denied that this was a “data breach.” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false.” He contended that Facebook users “knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” He also said that “everyone involved gave their consent.”","Mr. Grewal is right: This wasn’t a breach in the technical sense. It is something even more troubling: an all-too-natural consequence of Facebook’s business model, which involves having people go to the site for social interaction, only to be quietly subjected to an enormous level of surveillance. The results of that surveillance are used to fuel a sophisticated and opaque system for narrowly targeting advertisements and other wares to Facebook’s users.","Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook’s true customers, whom it works hard to please.","Facebook doesn’t just record every click and “like” on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases “external” data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge “offline” data — things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store — with its vast online databases.","Facebook even creates “shadow profiles” of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data. This is an involuntary dossier from which you cannot opt out in the United States.","Despite Facebook’s claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her “consent” — at least not in any meaningful sense of the word. It is true that if you found and read all the fine print on the site, you might have noticed that in 2014, your Facebook friends had the right to turn over all your data through such apps. (Facebook has since turned off this feature.) If you had managed to make your way through a bewildering array of options, you might have even discovered how to turn the feature off.","This wasn’t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.","Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person’s personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook “likes” — and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day?","Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual — especially since it is practically irrevocable.","What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time.","The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company’s operations in the 2016 presidential election.","If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn’t have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn’t free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone’s data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance.","Should we all just leave Facebook? That may sound attractive but it is not a viable solution. In many countries, Facebook and its products simply are the internet. Some employers and landlords demand to see Facebook profiles, and there are increasingly vast swaths of public and civic life — from volunteer groups to political campaigns to marches and protests — that are accessible or organized only via Facebook.","The problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests?","A business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability.","Zeynep Tufekci (@zeynep) is an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, the author of “Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest” and a contributing opinion writer."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Fake Facebook accounts were used to spread fake news in the US presidential election, according to US special counsel Robert Mueller’s recent Russian indictments.","Increased efforts","Since appearing before congressional committees over the past year, and receiving plenty of negative publicity around these issues, Facebook and other technology media platforms such as Twitter and Google have all stated that they will increase efforts to identify such accounts and misuse of their platforms.","That reassurance seems to have been persuasive to the European Commission, which this week issued a report from a high level expert group (iti.ms/2DqgFEE) in which it stated it was happy to have the social media giants self-regulate (iti.ms/2GtbcQz).","They do propose a broader platform for tackling what they call “disinformation” – promoting “media and information literacy”, demanding greater transparency of the algorithms media platforms use, “safeguarding” the diversity of European media, and developing tools for journalists and media users to “tackle disinformation”.","But the expert group (with the sole exception of EU consumer advocate organisation BEUC, which wanted a mandatory regulatory approach) feels the big media companies will be fine in trying to counter this constantly morphing problem. Despite the initial denials that algorithms could be gamed. Or that huge numbers of fake accounts have been created on platforms that supposedly strictly require proof of identity. Or that news could be manipulated. Or millions of users misled.","And yet, take just the example of the ongoing, lucrative, cruel proliferation of those military romance scammers on Facebook. A little investigation online shows this was a recognised problem half a decade ago, and that reporting such fake accounts to Facebook seems regularly to result in no action at all.","I’ve seen little compelling evidence that the big platforms can self-regulate or even that they have significant self-awareness about what is going on with their services (Facebook not noticing election ads paid for in roubles, anyone? Twitter leaving untouched self-proclaimed neo-Nazi accounts? Mark Zuckerberg’s denials and retractions?).","We reserve the right to remove any content at any time from this Community, including without limitation if it violates the Community Standards.

The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law.","Facebook said on Friday it had learned in 2015 that a Cambridge University psychology professor lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from a psychology testing application he had built.","Facebook said it suspended the firms and researchers involved and said the data had been misused but not stolen, because users gave permission.","“(Tech companies) are going to get a lot more scrutiny over what data they are collecting and how they are using it,” said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.","‘VERY CONCERNING’","European officials, who have been more willing to regulate Silicon Valley companies than their U.S. counterparts, were strident in criticism of Facebook.","The revelations about Cambridge Analytica were “horrifying, if confirmed,” said EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova. “We don’t want this in the EU and will take all possible legal measures” including stricter rules under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation that takes effect in May, she said.","A spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said the allegations were “clearly very concerning.”","The head of the European Parliament said EU lawmakers will investigate possible data misuse, calling the allegations an unacceptable violation of citizens’ privacy rights.","(This version of the story refiles to fix spell check errors of proper names and ticker symbol)","A 3D-printed Facebook logo are seen in front of displayed binary digits in this illustration taken, March 18, 2018.

Surely most of us can agree that a healthy dose of both is necessary for powerful advertising.","As direct-response advertisers, testing is a huge part of our daily ad operations; we’re continually running creatives against each other, optimizing campaign bids and budgets, and analyzing down-funnel results between audiences.","A lot of the time, well-structured campaigns can answer all the questions we have. Sometimes, though, we have to put our lab coats on, develop a solid hypothesis, isolate our variables and get our A/B testing on.","In this post, we’re sharing some of our experiences with Facebook’s newish testing feature, creative split testing, along with some advice on when and when NOT to leverage this feature.","First, a bit about the Facebook split testing feature.","Facebook Split Testing 101","Creative split testing (Facebook’s term for ad A/B testing) has evolved from an API-only feature (which we leveraged through our Facebook tech partner Smartly.io), into the self-serve tool it is today.","Facebook A/B testing works by evenly splitting your ad set (up to five times), eliminating audience overlap and ensuring that users only see one variation for the duration of the test. It also guarantees that the exact same amount of budget is allocated to each variation, something that is impossible to achieve without this feature.","Similarly, A/B testing typically works best with larger audiences. The bigger, the better, but aim for audiences of 1 million or more in each of your subsets.","Set your KPI of interest up front, whether that’s click-through rate or cost-per-install.","For an in-depth look at how to set up Facebook ads for split testing, Adespresso has you covered.","When You SHOULD Use Creative Split Testing","The value of creative split testing should be apparent; it helps advertisers determine the scientifically best performing ads, audiences, or bidding strategies. It does, however, require deliberate planning and dedicated budget, thus often lowering overall efficiency.","We’re constantly weighing the benefits of A/B testing with those costs, and have outlined some common scenarios in which you SHOULD utilize A/B tests, and others in which you SHOULDN’T.","Here are a few scenarios in which you should.","#1: Testing imagery to guide future creative direction","The golden rule of running split tests is quite simple–use them to test measurable hypotheses. As an advertising agency that strives to maintain campaign structure hygiene, we take this rule a step further. We run A/B tests against hypotheses that are meaningful to our overall strategy.","We ran a split test that tested an existing high-performing ad against one with the same messaging, concept and copy but a different design element.","Details: Our isolated variable in this test was the design concept; all ad copy, in-image copy, CTAs, and overall concepts were the same. By monitoring cost differences among our top performing audience segments, we wanted to determine which path to take creative concepts going forward.","Results: After running the test for a full week to reach statistical significance, we were able to determine a winner based on lower CPAs. We then utilized that learning to guide the rest of our creative asset production, helping us lower overall costs on average 60%.","#2: Testing messaging to inform company-wide strategy","Similar to our previous example, split-testing can help inform messaging across channels, or even company-wide.","We ran a split test for an early-stage transportation company to determine which first-touch messaging resonated best with their core demographic.","Details: While we could have run typical ad sets, we knew that in helping our client determine future positioning, having a high level of confidence was important. Running a controlled A/B test also gave us insight into lifetime value, which we’ll discuss later in this post.","Results: In this case, our messaging variations didn’t have a major effect on the CTR. Although statistically relevant, our winning messaging had a less than 3% better CTR. It’s important to remember, however, that even those findings are valuable, prompting us to ask us other questions–do we need to focus on other areas like the imagery? Calls-to-action? Value-prop communication? Should we target different audiences with different messaging?","#3: Testing creative concept variations for specific personas","Split testing can also be useful when figuring out what creative resonates with new or hard-to-crack audiences. Employing the “ax first, sandpaper later” mentality, you can utilize a split test to determine which tactics resonate better, and make incremental optimizations afterward.","Take for example...","For one client, we wanted to run a split test to see if persona-specific creative would perform better than generic creative among a new demographic group.","Details: This particular test utilized existing successful ads against new ads to test our hypothesis that persona-specific creative would do better.","Results: These findings were significant in that this was an entirely untouched user segment for us, and gave conclusive guidelines on how to approach this audience in the future. The costs for the losing concept were 270% higher.","#4: Determining long-tail value of messaging or user groups","Although more time- and resource-intensive, you can also use split testing to create pseudo cohorts to monitor over time after your initial test has completed. Here are some ideas...","Test what messaging produces the most bottom-of-the-funnel conversions (purchases, etc.).","We implemented this tactic for a subscription consumer goods startup to determine what upfront ad messaging produced the best return on ad spend after 28 days.","Details: For this specific test, we wanted to monitor ROAS of groups with and without an offer.","Results: After running our test long enough to get statistically relevant cost results, we continued to monitor our two groups. We determined that after 28 days, although conversion rates were virtually identical, one group did indeed have 27% higher ROAS.","When NOT to Use Split-Testing on Facebook","Now it’s time for a reality check. We don’t always have time to set up highly scientific, highly controlled A/B tests. In many circumstances, our structured campaigns and ad sets work just fine, and there are other tailor-made solutions for other circumstances.","Here are three situations you should rethink running an A/B test...","#1. Testing several different creative variables","This is basic A/B testing hygiene; only test one variable at a time.","Even if you wanted to test 20 variations, of that one variable, you’re going have a helluva time reaching statistical relevance. You’re better off just running typical ad sets, or if you really want to mix things up, give dynamic creative optimization (DCO) a go.","Although more of a black box, DCO can be more efficient at getting several learnings all at once. While it likely won’t inform your broader strategy, it’s a great use of resources if you want to test several ad copy variations, images, CTAs, etc.","As we’ve expressed already, A/B testing is best utilized when you MUST have learnings–when you have a specific, measurable hypothesis to prove or disprove. We don’t advise spinning your wheels A/B testing superfluous ad variations like words, image headlines, background colors, etc. Instead, test ads that are quite different conceptually.","The test on the left is better suited for an A/B test, as one image represents more stereotypical San Francisco imagery and the other represents more “local” imagery. The example on the right (testing color versus black and white photography) might be valuable, but less so to your business overall.","At the end of the day, Facebook split testing is the only way to truly run a scientifically precise A/B test. That said, they do require planning and resources, and as a rule of thumb, you should trust that Facebook’s algorithm will deliver your best converting ads.","So, unless you NEED undisputable answers, standard ad sets should get the job done. Regardless, we urge you to weigh the pros and cons of setting up, running, and analyzing a Facebook creative split test up front and hope this post helped you reach a conclusion.","About the author","Payton O'Neal is the resident inbound marketer at Bamboo, a mobile-first paid social advertising agency in San Francisco.

Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.","On March 17, reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London suggested Trump-campaign linked UK-based political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, had been able to buy data on 50 million Facebook users in 2015 to use for microtarging political advertising.","The data had been gathered via a third party survey app running on Facebook’s platform and using its API to pull data on the friends of the 270,000 respondents who answered the survey.","At the weekend Facebook took out full page newspaper ads in the US and UK apologizing for failing to protect users’ information.","Billions have been wiped off the company’s share price since the scandal broke.","The company’s share price also fell more than 5% today, on the news of the FTC announcement.","The consumer watchdog previously investigated Facebook over deceptive privacy claims, back in 2011.","And in 2012, as part of an FTC settlement, Facebook promised it would give users “clear and prominent notice” and get their consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.","It also agree to two decades of biennial audits.","Facebook avoided a financial penalty at the time, though if the FTC goes on to decide the company violated that earlier initial agreement it could certainly be on the hook for fines — fines which the Washington Post has suggested could scale to trillions of dollars if the FTC’s $40,000 per privacy violation is multiplied by the 50M Facebook users whose data was passed to Cambridge Analytica.","Whatever any eventual financial penalty might be, the reputational damage Facebook is suffering as a result of this snowballing data handling scandal is bad enough, adding to calls for policymakers to regulate social media platforms.","We’ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the FTC’s announcement — at the time of writing the company had not responded."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two thirds of the U.S. population.","It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and it is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.","Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica and two individuals going back to 2015.","That year, Facebook said, it learned that University of Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data that he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system.","Kogan was not immediately available for comment.","The app was downloaded by about 270,000 people.

The Canadian whistleblower at the centre of an international scandal that saw the Trump campaign capitalize politically from the use of private Facebook information got his start in politics with the Liberal Party of Canada.James H. Collins / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","OTTAWA — The Canadian whistleblower at the centre of an international scandal that allegedly helped the Trump campaign capitalize politically from private Facebook information got his start in politics with the Liberal Party of Canada.","But several senior Liberal officials from that time, about a decade ago, insist they have almost no recollection of then-teenager Christopher Wylie — if any at all.","The New York Times and The Observer of London have reported U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign hired a data-analytics company that harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users.","Cambridge Analytica, the company named by Wylie as being behind the massive leak, exploited private social media activity to help allow the Trump campaign to better target voters by profiling their behaviour and personalities ahead of the U.S. election, according to the reports. The firm connected with Trump’s political adviser Steve Bannon, whom Wylie also met, the reports said.","Wylie, a 28-year-old from British Columbia, is the data scientist who spoke out about controversy. He’s also the man who helped found Cambridge Analytica.","“I do feel responsible for it and it’s something that I regret,” Wylie said in a video interview posted on The Observer’s web page.","“It was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country, without their consent or awareness.”","The reports provided many details about whistleblower who in 2007 or 2008 landed his first political gig with the federal Liberals.","At age 17, he worked in the office of Canada’s opposition leader, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion, said one of the reports. When he was 18 years old, the newspaper said he learned all about data while working for officials on former U.S. president Barack Obama’s campaign team, and later introduced one director to the Liberals.","A senior source with the Liberal Party said Sunday that Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to publicly discuss staffing details.","However, former Liberal officials from that time said they either hadn’t heard of Wylie — or they barely remembered him.","“I vaguely recall him,” wrote one former senior official in an email Sunday. “I think that he was a summer intern.”","Another former senior Liberal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he asked former colleagues Sunday and some people remembered Wylie. They say he was “pretty junior” and worked in the data strategy and communications space.","One former party official, however, said while they didn’t know Wylie well, they remembered him as a “big advocate of microtargetting.”","One of the newspaper reports said Wylie came up with the idea behind Cambridge Analytica at age 24.","The article also said Wylie was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia as a teen and left school at 16 years old without any qualifications. After working for the Liberals and Obama’s campaign, the report said he taught himself to code at age 19 and later studied law at the London School of Economics.","The reports also said Cambridge Analytica played a major role in the referendum that led to Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.","Another article published May 2017 by The Guardian quoted a source that connected Wylie to a web analytics company in Victoria, B.C., called AggregateIQ. The firm has come under scrutiny in Britain for its possible role in helping the Leave campaign win the Brexit referendum.","Asked about Wylie, Canada’s Liberal Party said in a statement Sunday that protecting the information of Canadians it engages with is a “foremost priority.”","The party said it has a clear, stringent policy that protects individuals’ private information. It also said its agreements with campaign partners also include strict requirements.","The party insists it doesn’t sell information under any circumstances.","A spokeswoman for Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould said Sunday that social-media platforms have a responsibility to help ensure citizens and the democratic processes are protected from “threats like foreign interference, data breaches, hate speech, and misinformation.”","“While some social-media platforms have begun to take initial steps to address these issues, it’s clear that much more needs to be done,” Jordan Owens wrote in an email.","Owens said the government would work with social-media firms to ensure they respect and help preserve the integrity of Canada’s democracy.","Facebook said in a weekend blog post that claims the harvesting of user information was a data breach are “completely false.”","The statement said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his Facebook app.","“People knowingly gave their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” said the post by Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president and deputy general counsel."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebook’s official post.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” the added language argued.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","While the language is up for debate, lawmakers don’t appear to be looking kindly on Facebook’s arguably legitimate effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)","While most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.","On Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”","Just what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Use these at your own discretion and remember: you are responsible for any damages caused.","The views expressed in this article are my own and do not necessarily reflect the view of other people.","To all the script kiddies out there: I won’t release any plug-and-play script, sorry.","INTRODUCTION","Bad days for Facebook, uh?","This month, both Guardian and New York Times put Facebook in probably the biggest scandal in terms of trust and privacy. Anyway, long story short, Facebook exposed data on 50 million Facebook unaware users to a researcher who worked at Cambridge Analytica, which worked for the Trump campaign. But what it sounds scarier is how Cambridge Analytica got these massive data: it seems that, and I quote the New York Times, “Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes”.","After this scandal, a lot of people start to get a little bit more paranoid and start questioning how effectively Facebook handle their data and for what purposes. Online newspapers and magazines didn’t wait too much and start publishing articles as follow:","Web press starting to inform the readers about how to download your Facebook data.","So, I decided to do my homework: I wanna see what kind of information Facebook know about me.","1) Request and download my Facebook data","This process is very straightforward: once I was logged in, I went to “Settings” and clicked the “Download a copy of your Facebook data” button. Doing that, you will send to Facebook a request for your data and after some minutes (< 15 min. in my case) you’ll receive a notification and your files are ready to download.","Let’s examine them.","Requesting a download of my personal Facebook data.","The file I received was a “.zip” file (350 MB, more or less), I extracted it and opened the “index.htm” file.","This is how it looked like:","My personal Facebook data.","As you can see, it’s full of well-categorized information that you can easily search through the side menu: media contents, messages, applications used, and more.","That’s a lot of data, ain’t it?","Some bad things: I found on Twitter some users that claim to also have received back scary data has shown below (this story also appears on The Hacker News when I was writing this post):","Yes, that’s crazy but fortunately it wasn’t my case, I didn’t found any data regarding my phone calls or my SMS sent or received.","“It seems that in older versions of Android when permissions were a lot less strict, the Facebook app took away contact permission at the time of installation that allowed the company access to call and message data automatically.” (The Hacker News)","The title of this category is self-explained and in fact, I was able to retrieve the complete list of my Facebook friends with a huge list of my phone’s contacts, containing also old numbers that I don’t have anymore. It could be useful as a personal back-up, but I didn’t get why a lot of my contact has also their personal email address associated with it.","Facebook Contact Info page.","I’m also sure that all of these emails come directly from Facebook and not from my phone’s contact list: I checked every single email and I found on my phone less than 5% of these contacts. So, they came from Facebook.","In fact, Facebook gives you the opportunity to share your email addresses with:","everyone","just your friends","nobody","For most people sharing their personal emails is not an issue, I mean, that’s only an email address, right?","Here’s when my “blackhat personality” came out.","2) Collecting info and start having fun","I wrote down a script to crawl the HTML page and extract all the emails inside it: I was able to find 585 unique emails.","Some of the emails extracted","A note for the readers: more than one email found could point to a single individual (also the “secondary email” can be exposed from Facebook).","After that, I decided to check if some of these emails were been compromised in a previous data breach with the help of haveibeenpwned API. I wrote a simple Python script that can automatically do this check for me.","Querying haveibeenpwned API.","Some results that I found:","Unique emails: 585","Found on public breaches: 310","Not found in public breaches: 275","So, more than 50% of my emails contacts were been already compromised in a previous data breach (or in more than one). Ok, it will be fun.","This is the list of major breaches involved in descending order:","Adobe: 83","Myspace: 82","Dropbox: 34","LinkedIn: 19","Dailymotion: 17","etc…","At this point, let’s go more deeply and start searching for the passwords. I mean, these breaches are public, right? So the passwords need to be somewhere out there.","3) Passwords, passwords, passwords…","Three months ago on r/pwned subreddit appears what was seemed to be the largest aggregate database found in the dark web to date: these files are well organized and contain 1.4 billion clear text credentials and it was 41GB. The data is structured in an alphabetic directory tree fragmented in 1,981 pieces to allow fast searches.","Dump folders structure.","If you need more details about this database check this Medium post. And if you questioning yourself about how to download it, I won’t provide any sources or “howto” guide, sorry.","I transferred it to an external drive and write another Python script to search through it, in order to find some passwords previously compromised. Once again, this script was very simple:","Automating the passwords extraction in Python.","It takes me 15 minutes, more or less, to process all the email addresses found on my Facebook data but it worth the effort: 451 unique pairs of email/password have been found. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","More than 400 unique pairs of username/password found.","Since some email addresses were found on multiple data breaches, the number of passwords found was greater than the number of emails searched (310 email addresses returned me 451 unique passwords).","I notify a couple of friends about what I found and they admit to me: those passwords found are still used on other platforms. The following picture shows a conversation with a friend of mine about his passwords that I found (we’re both Italians):","A friend of mine confirms that he’s still using a password that I found.","4) Conclusions and open points","Avoid sharing personal emails, if not necessary and remember: Facebook is not a safe place for sharing them.","Password reusing is a real-life risk. Just stop to use the same simple password everywhere.","Password managers are not largely-adopted yet, we need to deal with this but you can make the difference and give it a try. There’s a lot of alternative out there (there are both free and paid alternatives).","A collection of write-ups from the best hackers in the world on topics ranging from bug bounties and CTFs to vulnhub machines, hardware challenges and real life encounters.

Sen. Ed Markey said that the firms should \"be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports\" and Sen. Amy Klobuchar said that \"Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.\"","Congress' Republican majority has been quieter. But a spokesperson for the House Energy and Commerce Committee said that the panel is \"is examining this incident closely.\" A spokesperson for the Senate Commerce Committee declined to comment on the matter.","The Washington Post talked to former Federal Trade Commission officials who said Facebook's actions may have violated an agreement the company had with the agency to make certain privacy guarantees to users. Such a violation could trigger a fine. Facebook told the paper it hadn't violated the agreement.","At the state level, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced an investigation into the data gathering.","Across the Atlantic:","British MP Damian Collins, who chairs the U.K. Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said that it seemed Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix \"has deliberately mislead the Committee and Parliament by giving false statements.\" He also said Zuckerberg or another Facebook executive should testify before the committee about the issue.","The British Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said that her office was \"investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used.\"","European Commissioner Věra Jourová, whose portfolio includes data protection issues, welcomed the British probe. \"Horrifying, if confirmed,\" she tweeted. \"Personal data of 50 mln #Facebook users could be so easily mishandled & used for political purpose. We don't want this in the EU.\" She promised to seek more information from the social giant during a trip to the United States this week.","The other side: “We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,\" said Facebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal in a Sunday statement. \"That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.\"","What's next: On Monday, Britain's Channel 4 is planning to air footage obtained when its reporters went undercover to speak with Cambridge Analytica's Nix and others at the company.

But\neven if users didn't give that permission to Messenger, they may have given\nit inadvertently for years through Facebook's mobile apps—because of the\nway Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past.","Facebook denied the claim,\nwriting in a blog post: “You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging\npeople’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not\nthe case.”","Facebook explained that users must opt in to share their mobile meta data.","It wrote:","Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using\nMessenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay\nconnected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better\nexperience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this\nfeature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can\nturn it off in settings, or here for\nFacebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared\nvia that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android,\nuploading this information has always been opt-in only.","However, Ars Technica questioned whether a service was really “opt\nin” if the opt-in was a default setting:","While data collection was technically \"opt-in,\" in both these cases the\nopt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook's application, not a\nseparate notification of data collection. Facebook never explicitly\nrevealed that the data was being collected, and it was only discovered as\npart of a review of the data associated with the accounts. The users we\ntalked to only performed such reviews after the recent revelations about\nCambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data.","This latest spat over privacy protection comes as Facebook has launched a\nmajor effort to rebuild trust amid the unfolding Cambridge Analytica\nscandal, in which a third-party organization obtained millions of users’\ndata without their permission.","Facebook’s\npublic statement, posted on its press site, comes a couple of days after it\ntook out full page newspaper ads\nto apologize for the misuse of data by third-party apps as it copes with\nfallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal (follow the story as it\ndevelops\nhere). In the ad, founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote “We\nhave a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t\ndeserve it.”","Some are demanding another apology—and a better explanation—from the social\nmedia company.","This time, the company has issued a statement saying it did nothing wrong.\nFor one thing, it emphasizes that while it may be storing data about every\nphone call and text, including who contacted whom, what time, and how long\nthe conversation was, it did not actually record the content of those\nconversations and texts. (Is that supposed to make us feel like our privacy\nhas been respected? Apparently Facebook thinks it should.)","Contact importers might be common, but tracking and storing data about\nevery call or text users make and receive is pretty uncommon, or at least I\nhope it is. Facebook appears to be deliberately ignoring the fact that\nthere's a huge difference between these two things.","Local news helps people connect to their communities about the issues that\nare closest to home. Earlier this year, we announced a change in the US to\nprioritize local news\nso people can see topics that have a direct impact on their community and\ndiscover what’s happening in their local area.","Today, we’re expanding that update to people in all countries, in all\nlanguages. Now, people around the world will see more news on Facebook from\nlocal sources covering their current city and other cities they may care\nabout.","However, the scandal seems unlikely to fade as users express their shock\nabout the sorts of data they found in their Facebook downloads.","I’ve just looked at the data files I requested from Facebook and they had every single phone number in my contacts. They had every single social event I went to, a list of all my friends (and their birthdays) and a list of every text I’ve sent.","They have plundered my phone.

That turns out to hold just as true for the\ncompany itself — a fact executives at the behemoth social\nnetwork have been discovering to their chagrin this week, amid\ninternational furor over the political strategy firm Cambridge\nAnalytica’s illicit access to a vast trove of Facebook user\ndata.","Facebook’s mistake, in this case, was a classic case of\ntaking a good idea too far. The idea was that the company’s\nmassive map of users’ social connections could be put to\ninnovative uses if that data were opened up to outside developers\n— allowing all sorts of third-party apps to painlessly add a\nsocial component.","Unfortunately, the company also made a critical misjudgment: It\nassumed that if users were willing to share personal information\nwith their friends, they were also willing to let their friends\nre-share that information.","Whether personal data is\nleaked through hacking or developers simply breaking\nconfidentiality promises, users need to be able to hold companies\naccountable for acting as responsible stewards of\ninformation.","CA wasn’t the only political shop to come up with that\ntrick, of course. In previous elections, Barack Obama’s\ndigital team had been hailed for its new media savvy for employing similar\ntactics. As Obama for America data-mining guru Carol Davidsen\nexplained: “We ingested the entire US social graph. We would\nask permission to basically scrape your profile and also scrape\nyour friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We\nscraped it all.”","But Cambridge Analytica went about its “scraping” in\na far dodgier way: The Obama team had at least vacuumed up data via\nan app that was explicitly billed as helping a political campaign.\nCambridge got its from a scholar, Aleksandr Kogan, who had pledged\nto use it only for academic research.","Worse, recent reports indicate that when Facebook discovered its\nuser information had been passed along, Cambridge retained it even\nafter assuring the company it had been deleted — an assurance\nFacebook appears to have blithely accepted.","By 2014, the social-media platform had altered its policy and\nshut off apps’ access to most types of information about users who\nhadn’t themselves installed that app. As it turned out, however,\nFacebook was closing the barn door after the horses had bolted\n— which is why it’s facing backlash now over a policy it\nchanged years ago.","The furor, however, has inspired a number of other overdue\nchanges: Facebook will be making an effort to notify users whose\ndata was obtained, conducting audits of developers who hold large\namounts of user data and revoking third-party apps’ access to the\ndata of users who haven’t logged in to those apps for several\nmonths.","The backlash has also, predictably, spurred an array of fresh\ncalls to regulate platforms like Facebook. Some of these —\nlike a federal breach notification requirement — have\nmerit.","Whether personal data is leaked through hacking or developers\nsimply breaking confidentiality promises, users need to be able to\nhold companies accountable for acting as responsible stewards of\ninformation.","They can’t do that if the firms are able to simply sweep\nincidents like this under the rug, as Facebook seemed content to do\nuntil press reports forced the issue. It would be a mistake,\nthough, to think regulatory micromanagement is likely to safeguard\nuser privacy.","Too often, privacy rules take the form of more stringent notice\nand consent requirements — a longer series of boxes to check\neach time data is shared. Like antibiotics, these invariably become\nless effective the more they’re used: Force users to click through\ntoo many privacy notices and, like most websites’ terms of service,\nthey become one more nuisance users sleepwalk through.","Either way, Facebook’s own efforts to improve users’ control\nover their privacy are healthy developments. But the incident -\nand the heat Facebook is taking as a result -\nshould serve as a sobering reminder to Silicon Valley that the\ndamage from bad privacy design choices can be hard to undo.

This data reportedly included information siphoned from hundreds of thousands of Amazon Mechanical Turkers who were paid to use a \"personality prediction app\" that collected data from them and also anyone they were friends with -- about 50 million accounts. That data reportedly turned into information used by the likes of Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon and the Donald Trump campaign for social media messaging and \"micro-targeting\" individuals based on shared characteristics.","Now, reports by The New York Times and The Guardian reveal what was behind the timing of that Friday night news dump. According to reporters from both outlets, which were collaborating, the social network had downplayed their reporting and even threatened to sue The Guardian, over what they learned from documents and a whistleblower (who Facebook included in its ban list): Christopher Wylie.","Wylie's account largely fills in the gaps from Facebook's statement. While Facebook didn't explain how many users had their data snagged by the \"thisisyourdigitallife\" app, the reports say it pulled private info from more than 50 million people even though they didn't know about it or consent -- an act that at the time was allowed under Facebook's rules. About 30 million of those (a number previously reported by The Intercept) contained enough information for Cambridge Analytica to match profiles with other data and complete its \"psychographic\" work -- learning about individuals and trying to target them with personally tailored messages.","That's the bit that causes Wylie to describe his former employer as engaging in something more like psychological warfare than simple \"data analysis.\" Cambridge Analytica maintains that \"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR.\" It also claims none of the data was used during the 2016 campaign, however, the NYT notes that its CEO previously said the Trump efforts drew on psychographics it had created for the Ted Cruz campaign.","As for Facebook, that company is staunchly pushing the line that this does not represent a \"breach\" or a \"leak\". Deputy General Counsel tweeted that \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\" In a series of now-deleted tweets, CSO Alex Stamos said the app's creator \"lied\" to users and Facebook about what he was using the data for, but said his use was consistent with its API at the time, and the way some APIs for contact sharing works on platforms like Android and iOS. Facebook updated last night's release with a new statement:","The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","That will not be enough to avoid further scrutiny however -- according to The Guardian, the British Information Commissioner's Office and the Electoral Commission are investigating. In the US, Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey announced her office is opening an investigation, and they probably won't be the only ones.","That's above and beyond the professor suing Cambridge Analytica in the UK to find out the full extent of the data it has acquired.

{"originalurl":"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/cambridge-analytica-facebook-quiz.html?referer=https://www.google.com/","title":"Opinion | Cambridge Analytica and the Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz - The New York Times","text":["Cambridge Analytica and the Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz","Do you panic easily? Do you often feel blue? Do you have a sharp tongue? Do you get chores done right away? Do you believe in the importance of art?","If ever you’ve answered questions like these on one of the free personality quizzes floating around Facebook, you’ll have learned what’s known as your Ocean score: How you rate according to the big five psychological traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. You may also be responsible the next time America is shocked by an election upset.","For several years, a data firm eventually hired by the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica, has been using Facebook as a tool to build psychological profiles that represent some 230 million adult Americans. A spinoff of a British consulting company and sometime-defense contractor known for its counterterrorism “psy ops” work in Afghanistan, the firm does so by seeding the social network with personality quizzes. Respondents — by now hundreds of thousands of us, mostly female and mostly young but enough male and older for the firm to make inferences about others with similar behaviors and demographics — get a free look at their Ocean scores. Cambridge Analytica also gets a look at their scores and, thanks to Facebook, gains access to their profiles and real names.","Cambridge Analytica worked on the “Leave” side of the Brexit campaign. In the United States it takes only Republicans as clients: Senator Ted Cruz in the primaries, Mr. Trump in the general election. Cambridge is reportedly backed by Robert Mercer, a hedge fund billionaire and a major Republican donor; a key board member is Stephen K. Bannon, the head of Breitbart News who became Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman and is set to be his chief strategist in the White House.","In the age of Facebook, it has become far easier for campaigners or marketers to combine our online personas with our offline selves, a process that was once controversial but is now so commonplace that there’s a term for it, “onboarding.” Cambridge Analytica says it has as many as 3,000 to 5,000 data points on each of us, be it voting histories or full-spectrum demographics — age, income, debt, hobbies, criminal histories, purchase histories, religious leanings, health concerns, gun ownership, car ownership, homeownership — from consumer-data giants.","No data point is very informative on its own, but profiling voters, says Cambridge Analytica, is like baking a cake. “It’s the sum of the ingredients,” its chief executive officer, Alexander Nix, told NBC News. Because the United States lacks European-style restrictions on second- or thirdhand use of our data, and because our freedom-of-information laws give data brokers broad access to the intimate records kept by local and state governments, our lives are open books even without social media or personality quizzes.","Ever since the advertising executive Lester Wunderman coined the term “direct marketing” in 1961, the ability to target specific consumers with ads — rather than blanketing the airwaves with mass appeals and hoping the right people will hear them — has been the marketer’s holy grail. What’s new is the efficiency with which individually tailored digital ads can be tested and matched to our personalities. Facebook is the microtargeter’s ultimate weapon.","The explosive growth of Facebook’s ad business has been overshadowed by its increasing role in how we get our news, real or fake. In July, the social network posted record earnings: quarterly sales were up 59 percent from the previous year, and profits almost tripled to $2.06 billion. While active users of Facebook — now 1.71 billion monthly active users — were up 15 percent, the real story was how much each individual user was worth. The company makes $3.82 a year from each global user, up from $2.76 a year ago, and an average of $14.34 per user in the United States, up from $9.30 a year ago. Much of this growth comes from the fact that advertisers not only have an enormous audience in Facebook but an audience they can slice into the tranches they hope to reach.","One recent advertising product on Facebook is the so-called “dark post”: A newsfeed message seen by no one aside from the users being targeted. With the help of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Trump’s digital team used dark posts to serve different ads to different potential voters, aiming to push the exact right buttons for the exact right people at the exact right times.","Imagine the full capability of this kind of “psychographic” advertising. In future Republican campaigns, a pro-gun voter whose Ocean score ranks him high on neuroticism could see storm clouds and a threat: The Democrat wants to take his guns away. A separate pro-gun voter deemed agreeable and introverted might see an ad emphasizing tradition and community values, a father and son hunting together.","In this election, dark posts were used to try to suppress the African-American vote. According to Bloomberg, the Trump campaign sent ads reminding certain selected black voters of Hillary Clinton’s infamous “super predator” line. It targeted Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood with messages about the Clinton Foundation’s troubles in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Federal Election Commission rules are unclear when it comes to Facebook posts, but even if they do apply and the facts are skewed and the dog whistles loud, the already weakening power of social opprobrium is gone when no one else sees the ad you see — and no one else sees “I’m Donald Trump, and I approved this message.”","While Hillary Clinton spent more than $140 million on television spots, old-media experts scoffed at Trump’s lack of old-media ad buys. Instead, his campaign pumped its money into digital, especially Facebook. One day in August, it flooded the social network with 100,000 ad variations, so-called A/B testing on a biblical scale, surely more ads than could easily be vetted by human eyes for compliance with Facebook’s “community standards.”","Perhaps out of necessity, the Trump team was embracing a new-media lesson: It didn’t have to build everything from scratch. Mark Zuckerberg and others had already built the infrastructure the campaign needed to reach voters directly. When “Trump TV” went live on Facebook before and after the second debate it raked in $9 million in donations in 120 minutes.","In the immediate wake of Mr. Trump’s surprise election, so many polls and experts were so wrong that it became fashionable to declare that big data was dead. But it isn’t, not when its most obvious avatar, Facebook, was so crucial to victory.","On Monday, after a similar announcement from Google, Facebook said it would no longer allow fake-news websites to show ads, on their own sites, from Facebook’s ad network — a half-step that neither blocks what appears on your newsfeed nor affects how advertisers can microtarget users on the social network.","There are surely more changes to come. Mr. Zuckerberg is young, still skeptical that his radiant transparency machine could be anything but a force for good, rightly wary of policing what the world’s diverse citizens say and share on his network, so far mostly dismissive of Facebook’s role in the election. If Mr. Zuckerberg takes seriously his oft-stated commitments to diversity and openness, he must grapple honestly with the fact that Facebook is no longer just a social network. It’s an advertising medium that’s now dangerously easy to weaponize.","A Trump administration is unlikely to enforce transparency about who is targeted by dark posts and other hidden political ads — or to ensure that politicians take meaningful ownership of what the ads say. But Facebook can.","McKenzie Funk, an Open Society fellow, is a founding member of the journalism cooperative Deca and the author of “Windfall: The Booming Business of Global Warming.”","A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SR5 of the New York edition with the headline: The Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz.

It was the late 1990s, and the political advertising operative had an idea about using a relatively newfangled tool – banner ads on web sites – to promote political candidates. “It was pretty clear to me at the time that the ability to target and tailor messaging was perfect for political campaigns,” Gould recalled recently. “I did a whole presentation on the internet and the power to connect, track, do fundraising, target.”","But when Gould finished his pitches, he would be met with blank stares. “I was a very lonely pied piper,” he says.","Finally, in 1998, Gould found a political candidate who was so far behind in the polls, and so strapped for cash, that he was willing to take a risk and spend $100,000 on banner ads on the New York Times homepage. Peter Vallone, then a New York City council member challenging George Pataki for the governorship, gave Gould the green light for an ad buy that has since entered the history books as the first significant use of online advertising in a political campaign.","The ads themselves are lost to internet history – Gould believes he may have copies somewhere on floppy discs. But it’s not hard to draw a line from that moment to Robert Mueller’s 16 February indictment of the Internet Research Agency, which alleges that Russian agents carried out a conspiracy to interfere with a US presidential election, in large part by purchasing targeted Facebook ads designed to “encourage US minority groups not to vote”.Or to the news recently revealed in the Observer that 50m Facebook profiles were obtained and misused by data mining company Cambridge Analytica to target voters during the 2016 presidential election.","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","The Vallone ads contained rudimentary versions of many of the attributes that make digital advertising such a powerful – and terrifying – force today: the ability to target specific audiences with tailored messages, then track their reaction.","“Come November 2000, I expect the question will no longer be whether web-based political advertising works,” wrote Cyrus Krohn, then the manager of political advertising for the Microsoft Network, in a prescient 1999 column for Slate, “but whether it works too well.”","Nearly 20 years later, the world has caught up to Krohn’s concerns, with some critics making the not entirely hyperbolic argument that micro-targeted “dark advertising” on Facebook is a fundamental threat to democracy itself. Is it too late for democracy to fix itself?","Parscale had been a little-known digital marketing executive working out of Texas when he was tapped to build Trump’s campaign website in 2015. Until then, digital advertising was barely a rounding error in campaign budgets. In 2008, the year Barack Obama became the first social media candidate, candidates spent just $22.25m on online political ads, according to an analysis by Borrell Associates. That number grew significantly in 2012, but the real explosion came in 2016, when campaigns pumped $1.4bn into digital ads.","US presidential campaigns are often remembered – and understood – by their advertisements. Lyndon B Johnson’s “Daisy” ad powerfully (and controversially) set the stakes of an election in a nuclear world. George HW Bush’s “Willie Horton” attack ad still epitomizes the racist dog-whistle politics of the tough-on-crime era. The message, as much as the messenger, is a key part of the debate over who is best equipped to lead the country.","But no such public debate took place around Trump’s apparently game-changing digital political advertisements before election day.","This is partly due to a loophole in the prevailing campaign finance law, which was written in 2002 and did not include internet ads in the class of regulated “electioneering communications”. But perhaps even more important is the very nature of online advertising, which is self-serve (just sign up with a credit card and go) and highly iterative.","Parscale claims he typically ran 50,000 to 60,000 variations of Facebook ads each day during the Trump campaign, all targeting different segments of the electorate. Understanding the meaning of a single one of those ads would require knowing what the ad actually said, who the campaign targeted to see that ad, and how that audience responded. Multiply that by 100 and you have a headache; by 50,000 and you’ll start to doubt your grasp on reality. Then remember that this is 50,000 a day over the course of a campaign that lasted more than a year.","“The reason I said it might work too well,” Krohn said in a recent interview with the Guardian, “is that mass marketing went away and micro-targeting – nano-targeting – came to fruition.”","Any candidate using Facebook can put a campaign message promising one thing in front of one group of voters while simultaneously running an ad with a completely opposite message in front of a different group of voters. The ads themselves are not posted anywhere for the general public to see (this is what’s known as “dark advertising”), and chances are, no one will ever be the wiser.","Trump digital director says Facebook helped win the White House","Read more","That undermines the very idea of a “marketplace of ideas”, says Ann Ravel, a former member of the Federal Election Commission who has long advocated stricter regulations on digital campaigning. “The way to have a robust democracy is for people to hear all these ideas and make decisions and discuss,” Ravel said. “With microtargeting, that is not happening.”","Parscale and his staff told reporters with Bloomberg that they used Facebook ads to target Hillary Clinton supporters with messages designed to make them sit the election out, including her own forays into dog-whistle politics from the 1990s, which the Trump campaign hoped would discourage black voters from turning out to the polls.","That degree of political manipulation might be unsavory, but it’s also relatively old-fashioned. One digital campaign staffer (not affiliated with the Trump campaign) compared it to Richard Nixon’s Southern Strategy, only “technologically savvy”.","But new reporting by the Observer has revealed that the data analytics team that worked for Trump, Cambridge Analytica, went far beyond Nixonian dirty tricks. The firm obtained Facebook data harvested under the auspices of an academic study, the Observer has revealed, and then used that data to target millions of US voters based on their psychological weaknesses.","“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,” whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Observer about the data theft, “and built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.”","European elections","Political advertising in the US is the wild west compared with other western democracies, which tend to have shorter election campaigns with strict regulations on the amount and type of spending permitted. Such rules may enhance the impact of digital advertising, which is much cheaper than television and largely unregulated.","The UK has seen a rapid shift to digital campaigning following the Conservative party’s embrace of Facebook in the 2015 general election. The Tories outspent Labour by a factor of 10 on Facebook advertisements, a decision that many political observers saw as decisive. In a country that bans political ads on television, Facebook enabled the Conservatives to reach 80.65% of users in targeted constituencies with its promoted posts and video ads, according to marketing materials created by Facebook. (At some point in the past year, the company began hiding previously produced “Success Stories” about its ability to sway election results.)","The Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum went on to spend almost its entire budget on Facebook advertising, an investment that resulted in about 1bn targeted digital ads being served to voters over the course of a 10-week campaign.","Though it is impossible to parse the exact impact of Facebook advertisements amid all the other factors that shape an electoral result (including organic Facebook content), the platform is increasingly cited as a factor in the growing electoral might of far-right groups in Europe.","Supporters of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party demonstrate outside the Chancellery in Berlin last week.

Facebook advertisements and targeting information gathered by Italian transparency group Openpolis found that the neo-fascist Brothers of Italy party ran a Facebook ad targeting Italian adults who are interested in the paramilitary police force, the carabinieri.","After the polls closed in Italy, the League’s Matteo Salvini shared some words of gratitude with the press: “Thank God for the internet. Thank God for social media. Thank God for Facebook.”","Targeting the midterms","While investigations into the 2016 US election and Brexit referendum continue, it’s worth remembering that more elections are fast approaching. Scores of countries will hold national elections in 2018, including Sweden, Ireland, Egypt, Mexico and Brazil.","In the US, candidates for the 435 congressional and 35 Senate seats that are up for grabs in November are already running campaigns on Facebook, and we may never know what they’re saying in those advertisements.","Take, for example, Paul Nehlen, a candidate who is running a Republican primary challenge against the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, in Wisconsin. Nehlen is primarily known as a vehement antisemite who was once embraced by Steve Bannon and the Breitbart wing of the right, but was excommunicated after appearing on a white supremacist podcast.","They’ve built this incredibly powerful platform that allows very narrow targeting ... so that scares me","Alan Mislove, professor","According to his FEC filings, Nehlen spent at least $2,791.72 on Facebook ads in the final six months of 2017.","What did that money buy?","In the first instance, everything that any Facebook advertiser can get: access to one of the most powerful databases of personal information that has ever existed, with insights into individuals’ intimate relationships, political beliefs, consumer habits and internet browsing.","Beyond that, we don’t know. Nehlen could be using Facebook to target likely voters in his district with a message about infrastructure. Or he could have taken a list of his own core supporters (he has more than 40,000 likes on Facebook), used Facebook’s “lookalike audience” tool to find other people inclined to support his particular politics, then fed them ads designed to persuade more people to join him in hating Jews.","Last fall, after Facebook had been forced to admit that, despite its initial denials, its platform had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the election, the company announced a set of reforms designed to assuage its critics – and stave off actual, enforceable regulation.","Starting this summer, the platform has promised that every political ad will be linked back to the page that paid for it. The pages themselves will display every ad that they’re running, as well as demographic information about the audience that they are reaching, a measure that Mark Zuckerberg claimed would “bring Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency” than the law requires for television or other media.","A version of these reforms is already live in Canada, where users can see all the ads being run by a political candidate in a designated tab on their page.","But there is good reason to be skeptical.","Since 2014, Facebook has had a transparency tool for all ads served on the platform. Click on the upper right-hand corner of a Facebook ad and you’ll see an option reading “Why am I seeing this ad?” Click through and you’ll get an explanation of the characteristics that make you desirable to the advertiser.","So far so good, but a new study by computer scientists found that Facebook’s ad explanations were “often incomplete and sometimes misleading” in a way that “may allow malicious advertisers to easily obfuscate ad explanations that are discriminatory or that target privacy-sensitive attributes”.","Alan Mislove, a professor of computer science at Northeastern University and one of the study’s co-authors, said that he gave Facebook credit for having the feature at all, noting that it is one of the only examples of a company offering any kind of explanation of how an algorithm actually works. But the findings do not paint a particularly pretty picture of Facebook’s ability to self-regulate.","“They’ve built this incredibly powerful platform that allows very narrow targeting, a very powerful tool that anyone on the internet can use, so that scares me,” Mislove said. “And up until very recently, there was very little accountability. You as a malicious actor on Facebook don’t even really need to obfuscate your behavior, because the only person watching is Facebook.”","Honest Ads Act","The best hope for bringing some order to the realm of digital political ads is through updating US law for the Facebook era.","A bipartisan proposal to do just that exists. In October, Senators Amy Klobuchar, Mark Warner and John McCain introduced the Honest Ads Act, which would close the loophole that allows internet ads to avoid regulation, and also require internet platforms (ie Facebook and Google) to maintain a public file of all the political ads they run and who paid for them.","But as much as we need transparency around political ads to maintain democracy, we also need a functioning democracy to get that transparency. And it’s not clear that it’s not already too late.","“In an ideal world, with a fully functioning Congress, there would be hearings around the Honest Ads Act, and you would have Facebook and Google and Twitter and experts testify to shine a light on the nature of political advertising,” said Brendan Fischer, director of FEC reform at the Campaign Legal Center. “We’re not close to that at all.”","In the absence of a fully functioning Congress, what is to be done? Should we expect Facebook to simply stop selling political ads?","Antonio Garcia Martinez, a former product manager for Facebook who helped develop its advertising toolssays that he has come to realize that political ads are simply a different beast than commercial ones, which can and should be treated differently by his former employer.","“Selling shoes needs to be different than selling politicians, even though the mechanics of it are identical,” he said. “Morally it’s different.”","Or should we pressure Facebook to stop allowing candidates with hateful or extremist views to use its tools?","“If we farm these important democratic responsibilities out to a private company, today they might be regulating antisemitism, but tomorrow they’re regulating what people can say about the Honest Ads Act,” Fischer said.","Indeed, Facebook could already be suppressing political views unfavorable to its business practices, and we would have no way of knowing. It’s possible Facebook wouldn’t even know. In response to queries about inconsistent moderation of clothing advertisements, a Facebook spokeswoman recently told the New York Times that “the company could not ask an automated system about [its] decisions”.","Frankenstein’s monster is not under any human’s control.","No one can pretend Facebook is just harmless fun any more | Ellie Mae O’Hagan","Read more","If this all seems positively dystopian, one person who is surprisingly sanguine is Alan Gould.","Gould left politics soon after the Vallone campaign, founded an advertising analytics firm, sold it, and is now a tech investor. He does have concerns about media literacy and Facebook’s tendency to trap people in filter bubbles, but says: “If people choose to stay in that bubble and not explore anything outside of it, that’s a statement about who they are and not about the technology.","“If you’re going to have a representative democracy, then you have to have a way to communicate with the voters and you’re going to use whatever is available, whether that’s newspapers or mail or email or Snapchat,” he said. “I don’t regret it at all.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The reports also said the data had not been deleted despite Facebook’s demands that the firm do so as far back as 2015.","On Saturday, Facebook denied that the Cambridge Analytica situation constituted a “data breach.” It also said that Cambridge Analytica did not use any of the Facebook data in question as part of its work on behalf of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","Even so, the case highlights the fact that the processes Facebook had in place allowed the data to be shared beyond what it had authorized. The company now faces a greater regulatory risk as a result of the disclosure, while third-party ad measurement partners may face more restrictions, according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.","Related","“We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,” Wieser wrote in a research note Sunday. However, he added, “the company’s business won’t likely be meaningfully impacted for now because we don’t think advertisers will suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform.”","According to Facebook, University of Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan lied to Facebook and violated its terms of service by passing on the data from an app that was using the Facebook login feature to Cambridge Analytica.","“Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent,” Paul Grewal, Facebook VP and deputy general counsel, wrote in a statement on the company’s blog site on Saturday. “People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","According to Facebook, it currently puts all apps requesting detailed user information through an app review process that requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it.","Facebook announced late Friday that it was suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories and its Cambridge Analytica division from using the social platform. Cambridge Analytica, which according to its website “uses data to change audience behavior,” has offices in London, New York, and Washington, D.C. Per the Times, Cambridge Analytica provided various services for Trump’s 2016 election campaign, including “designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals” as well as modeling voter turnout in U.S. states to inform TV ad buying.","[UPDATE: Facebook said in a blog post later Monday that it hired digital-forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica; the company said Cambridge Analytica has agreed to cooperate.]","Kogan created an app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” that offered personality predictions and advertised itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Around 270,000 people downloaded the app, granted access to data such as the city they set on their profile or Facebook content they had liked, as well as some limited information about friends who had privacy settings that allowed that sharing. Hence, through the 270,000 users who opted in to Kogan’s app, he was able to access data on 50 million-plus Facebook users.","“Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal wrote.","Facebook will take “legal action if necessary” against Cambridge Analytica or others involved, Grewal added.","Sign Up for Daily Insider Newsletter","[UPDATE, 4:03 p.m. ET: Facebook shed about $36.4 billion of market value at the close of trading Monday, after shares tumbled 6.8% for the day.

Because of that, Facebook would find it more difficult to track users’ activity on other websites via third-party cookies.","The Facebook Container Add-On was launched in the light of news that Facebook at one point allowed applications to harvest large amounts of data on users and their friends and follows Mozilla’s announcement that it has paused Facebook advertising until the social network improves the privacy of its users.","The privacy scandal started with reports that Cambridge Analytica, the data analysis firm hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, harvested 50 million Facebook users’ profiles without their permission.","This is what determined Mozilla last week to pause Facebook advertising, despite Mark Zuckerberg’s assurance that steps will be taken to ensure a situation like the Cambridge Analytica one won’t happen again.","“Facebook knows a great deal about their two billion users — perhaps more intimate information than any other company does. They know everything we click and like on their site, and know who our closest friends and relationships are,” Mozilla said last week.","Now, the browser maker says that users can enjoy both their time on Facebook and navigating on other websites they like. For that to happen, users should have tools that limit the data that others can collect on them, Mozilla included. Because of that, the browser won’t collect data from the use of the Facebook Container extension, except for information on how many times the extension is installed or removed.","The new extension, Mozilla claims, should provide users with the means to protect themselves from any side effects of usage.","“The type of data in the recent Cambridge Analytica incident would not have been prevented by Facebook Container. But troves of data are being collected on your behavior on the internet, and so giving users a choice to limit what they share in a way that is under their control is important,” the browser maker notes.","When installed, the extension deletes the user’s Facebook cookies and logs them out of the social platform. The next time they visit Facebook, the website will open in a new blue-colored browser tab (a container tab).","Users will be able to log into Facebook and use it like they would normally do. When clicking on a non-Facebook link or navigating to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, those pages load outside of the container.","When clicking on Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs, the extension loads them within the Facebook container. However, when the buttons are clicked, Facebook receives information on the website that the user shared from.","“If you use your Facebook credentials to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials, it may not work properly and you may not be able to login. Also, because you’re logged into Facebook in the container tab, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook container tab will not work,” Mozilla explains.","Because of that, Facebook can’t associate information about the activity of the user on websites outside of the platform to their Facebook identity. Thus, the social network won’t be able to use the activity collected off Facebook to send ads and other targeted messages.","“There’s a lot of value in your social data. It’s important to regularly review your privacy settings on all sites and applications that use it. The EFF has useful advice on how to keep your data where you want it to be, under more of your control,” Mozilla notes.","Facebook isn’t the only firm to collect data from user’s activity outside of the core service, but this is a problem that can be solved quickly.

I guess that's all they have left,\" he said.","Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the \"Wild West.\"","\"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,\" he said.","With Republicans controlling the Senate's majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail.","The New York Times and London's Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted despite Facebook's demands beginning in 2015.","Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015. The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said.","Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump's 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information.","Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action.","Cambridge Analytica in turn said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it.","Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. \"We must do better and will,\" he wrote on Twitter, adding that \"our business depends on it at every level.\"","Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied.","Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said Facebook was relying on the good will of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse.","Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday. \"That's a long time,\" she said.","Britain's data protection authority and the Massachusetts attorney general on Saturday said they were launching investigations into the use of Facebook data.","\"It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\" UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's office said she wants to understand how the data was used, what policies if any were violated and what the legal implications are.","(Reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Peter Henderson and Chris Reese)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Now, 28-year-old Christopher Wylie goes on the record to discuss his role in hijacking the profiles of millions of Facebook users in order to target the US electorate","The first time I met Christopher Wylie, he didn’t yet have pink hair. That comes later. As does his mission to rewind time. To put the genie back in the bottle.","By the time I met him in person, I’d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time. On the phone, he was clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling. A master storyteller. A politicker. A data science nerd.","Two months later, when he arrived in London from Canada, he was all those things in the flesh. And yet the flesh was impossibly young. He was 27 then (he’s 28 now), a fact that has always seemed glaringly at odds with what he has done. He may have played a pivotal role in the momentous political upheavals of 2016. At the very least, he played a consequential role. At 24, he came up with an idea that led to the foundation of a company called Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that went on to claim a major role in the Leave campaign for Britain’s EU membership referendum, and later became a key figure in digital operations during Donald Trump’s election campaign.","Or, as Wylie describes it, he was the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating “Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindfuck tool”.","In 2014, Steve Bannon – then executive chairman of the “alt-right” news network Breitbart – was Wylie’s boss. And Robert Mercer, the secretive US hedge-fund billionaire and Republican donor, was Cambridge Analytica’s investor. And the idea they bought into was to bring big data and social media to an established military methodology – “information operations” – then turn it on the US electorate.","It was Wylie who came up with that idea and oversaw its realisation. And it was Wylie who, last spring, became my source. In May 2017, I wrote an article headlined “The great British Brexit robbery”, which set out a skein of threads that linked Brexit to Trump to Russia. Wylie was one of a handful of individuals who provided the evidence behind it. I found him, via another Cambridge Analytica ex-employee, lying low in Canada: guilty, brooding, indignant, confused. “I haven’t talked about this to anyone,” he said at the time. And then he couldn’t stop talking.","By that time, Steve Bannon had become Trump’s chief strategist. Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, had won contracts with the US State Department and was pitching to the Pentagon, and Wylie was genuinely freaked out. “It’s insane,” he told me one night. “The company has created psychological profiles of 230 million Americans. And now they want to work with the Pentagon? It’s like Nixon on steroids.”","He ended up showing me a tranche of documents that laid out the secret workings behind Cambridge Analytica. And in the months following publication of my article in May,it was revealed that the company had “reached out” to WikiLeaks to help distribute Hillary Clinton’s stolen emails in 2016. And then we watched as it became a subject of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian collusion in the US election.","The Observer also received the first of three letters from Cambridge Analytica threatening to sue Guardian News and Media for defamation. We are still only just starting to understand the maelstrom of forces that came together to create the conditions for what Mueller confirmed last month was “information warfare”. But Wylie offers a unique, worm’s-eye view of the events of 2016. Of how Facebook was hijacked, repurposed to become a theatre of war: how it became a launchpad for what seems to be an extraordinary attack on the US’s democratic process.","Wylie oversaw what may have been the first critical breach. Aged 24, while studying for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting, he came up with a plan to harvest the Facebook profiles of millions of people in the US, and to use their private and personal information to create sophisticated psychological and political profiles. And then target them with political ads designed to work on their particular psychological makeup.","He hesitates. “I’ll point out that I assumed it was entirely legal and above board.”","Last month, Facebook’s UK director of policy, Simon Milner, told British MPs on a select committee inquiry into fake news, chaired by Conservative MP Damian Collins, that Cambridge Analytica did not have Facebook data. The official Hansard extract reads:","Christian Matheson (MP for Chester): “Have you ever passed any user information over to Cambridge Analytica or any of its associated companies?”","Simon Milner: “No.”","Matheson: “But they do hold a large chunk of Facebook’s user data, don’t they?”","Milner: “No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Two weeks later, on 27 February, as part of the same parliamentary inquiry, Rebecca Pow, MP for Taunton Deane, asked Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix: “Does any of the data come from Facebook?” Nix replied: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","And through it all, Wylie and I, plus a handful of editors and a small, international group of academics and researchers, have known that – at least in 2014 – that certainly wasn’t the case, because Wylie has the paper trail. In our first phone call, he told me he had the receipts, invoices, emails, legal letters – records that showed how, between June and August 2014, the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users had been harvested. Most damning of all, he had a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately.","Going public involves an enormous amount of risk. Wylie is breaking a non-disclosure agreement and risks being sued. He is breaking the confidence of Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer.","It’s taken a rollercoaster of a year to help get Wylie to a place where it’s possible for him to finally come forward. A year in which Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of investigations on both sides of the Atlantic – Robert Mueller’s in the US, and separate inquiries by the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK, both triggered in February 2017, after the Observer’s first article in this investigation.","It has been a year, too, in which Wylie has been trying his best to rewind – to undo events that he set in motion. Earlier this month, he submitted a dossier of evidence to the Information Commissioner’s Office and the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit. He is now in a position to go on the record: the data nerd who came in from the cold.","There are many points where this story could begin. One is in 2012, when Wylie was 21 and working for the Liberal Democrats in the UK, then in government as junior coalition partners. His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","Wylie grew up in British Columbia and as a teenager he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. He left school at 16 without a single qualification. Yet at 17, he was working in the office of the leader of the Canadian opposition; at 18, he went to learn all things data from Obama’s national director of targeting, which he then introduced to Canada for the Liberal party. At 19, he taught himself to code, and in 2010, age 20, he came to London to study law at the London School of Economics.","“Politics is like the mob, though,” he says. “You never really leave. I got a call from the Lib Dems. They wanted to upgrade their databases and voter targeting. So, I combined working for them with studying for my degree.”","Politics is also where he feels most comfortable. He hated school, but as an intern in the Canadian parliament he discovered a world where he could talk to adults and they would listen. He was the kid who did the internet stuff and within a year he was working for the leader of the opposition.","It showed these odd patterns. People who liked 'I hate Israel' on Facebook also tended to like KitKats","“He’s one of the brightest people you will ever meet,” a senior politician who’s known Wylie since he was 20 told me. “Sometimes that’s a blessing and sometimes a curse.”","Starting in 2007,Stillwell, while a student, had devised various apps for Facebook, one of which, a personality quiz called myPersonality, had gone viral. Users were scored on “big five” personality traits – Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism – and in exchange, 40% of them consented to give him access to their Facebook profiles. Suddenly, there was a way of measuring personality traits across the population and correlating scores against Facebook “likes” across millions of people.","Examples, above and below, of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test. Respondents were asked: How important should this message be to all Americans?","The research was original, groundbreaking and had obvious possibilities. “They had a lot of approaches from the security services,” a member of the centre told me. “There was one called You Are What You Like and it was demonstrated to the intelligence services. And it showed these odd patterns; that, for example, people who liked ‘I hate Israel’ on Facebook also tended to like Nike shoes and KitKats.","“There are agencies that fund research on behalf of the intelligence services. And they were all over this research. That one was nicknamed Operation KitKat.”","The defence and military establishment were the first to see the potential of the research. Boeing, a major US defence contractor, funded Kosinski’s PhD and Darpa, the US government’s secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is cited in at least two academic papers supporting Kosinski’s work.","But when, in 2013, the first major paper was published, others saw this potential too, including Wylie. He had finished his degree and had started his PhD in fashion forecasting, and was thinking about the Lib Dems. It is fair to say that he didn’t have a clue what he was walking into.","“I wanted to know why the Lib Dems sucked at winning elections when they used to run the country up to the end of the 19th century,” Wylie explains. “And I began looking at consumer and demographic data to see what united Lib Dem voters, because apart from bits of Wales and the Shetlands it’s weird, disparate regions. And what I found is there were no strong correlations. There was no signal in the data.","“And then I came across a paper about how personality traits could be a precursor to political behaviour, and it suddenly made sense. Liberalism is correlated with high openness and low conscientiousness, and when you think of Lib Dems they’re absent-minded professors and hippies. They’re the early adopters… they’re highly open to new ideas. And it just clicked all of a sudden.”","Here was a way for the party to identify potential new voters. The only problem was that the Lib Dems weren’t interested.","“I did this presentation at which I told them they would lose half their 57 seats, and they were like: ‘Why are you so pessimistic?’ They actually lost all but eight of their seats, FYI.”","Another Lib Dem connection introduced Wylie to a company called SCL Group, one of whose subsidiaries, SCL Elections, would go on to create Cambridge Analytica (an incorporated venture between SCL Elections and Robert Mercer, funded by the latter). For all intents and purposes, SCL/Cambridge Analytica are one and the same.","Alexander Nix, then CEO of SCL Elections, made Wylie an offer he couldn’t resist. “He said: ‘We’ll give you total freedom. Experiment. Come and test out all your crazy ideas.’”","Another example of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test.","In the history of bad ideas, this turned out to be one of the worst. The job was research director across the SCL group, a private contractor that has both defence and elections operations. Its defence arm was a contractor to the UK’s Ministry of Defence and the US’s Department of Defense, among others. Its expertise was in “psychological operations” – or psyops –changing people’s minds not through persuasion but through “informational dominance”, a set of techniques that includes rumour, disinformation and fake news.","SCL Elections had used a similar suite of tools in more than 200 elections around the world, mostly in undeveloped democracies that Wylie would come to realise were unequipped to defend themselves.","Wylie holds a British Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visa – a UK work visa given to just 200 people a year. He was working inside government (with the Lib Dems) as a political strategist with advanced data science skills. But no one, least of all him, could have predicted what came next. When he turned up at SCL’s offices in Mayfair, he had no clue that he was walking into the middle of a nexus of defence and intelligence projects, private contractors and cutting-edge cyberweaponry.","“The thing I think about all the time is, what if I’d taken a job at Deloitte instead? They offered me one. I just think if I’d taken literally any other job, Cambridge Analytica wouldn’t exist. You have no idea how much I brood on this.”","A few months later, in autumn 2013, Wylie met Steve Bannon. At the time, he was editor-in-chief of Breitbart, which he had brought to Britain to support his friend Nigel Farage in his mission to take Britain out of the European Union.","What was he like?","“Smart,” says Wylie. “Interesting. Really interested in ideas. He’s the only straight man I’ve ever talked to about intersectional feminist theory. He saw its relevance straightaway to the oppressions that conservative, young white men feel.”","Wylie meeting Bannon was the moment petrol was poured on a flickering flame. Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time. He had a theory to prove. And at the time, this was a purely intellectual problem. Politics was like fashion, he told Bannon.","If you do not respect the agency of people, anything you do after that point is not conducive to democracy","Christopher Wylie","“[Bannon] got it immediately. He believes in the whole Andrew Breitbart doctrine that politics is downstream from culture, so to change politics you need to change culture. And fashion trends are a useful proxy for that. Trump is like a pair of Uggs, or Crocs, basically. So how do you get from people thinking ‘Ugh. Totally ugly’ to the moment when everyone is wearing them? That was the inflection point he was looking for.”","But Wylie wasn’t just talking about fashion. He had recently been exposed to a new discipline: “information operations”, which ranks alongside land, sea, air and space in the US military’s doctrine of the “five-dimensional battle space”. His brief ranged across the SCL Group – the British government has paid SCL to conduct counter-extremism operations in the Middle East, and the US Department of Defense has contracted it to work in Afghanistan.","I tell him that another former employee described the firm as “MI6 for hire”, and I’d never quite understood it.","“It’s like dirty MI6 because you’re not constrained. There’s no having to go to a judge to apply for permission. It’s normal for a ‘market research company’ to amass data on domestic populations. And if you’re working in some country and there’s an auxiliary benefit to a current client with aligned interests, well that’s just a bonus.”","When I ask how Bannon even found SCL, Wylie tells me what sounds like a tall tale, though it’s one he can back up with an email about how Mark Block, a veteran Republican strategist, happened to sit next to a cyberwarfare expert for the US air force on a plane. “And the cyberwarfare guy is like, ‘Oh, you should meet SCL. They do cyberwarfare for elections.’”","It was Bannon who took this idea to the Mercers: Robert Mercer – the co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who used his billions to pursue a rightwing agenda, donating to Republican causes and supporting Republican candidates – and his daughter Rebekah.","Nix and Wylie flew to New York to meet the Mercers in Rebekah’s Manhattan apartment.","“She loved me. She was like, ‘Oh we need more of your type on our side!’”","Your type?","“The gays. She loved the gays. So did Steve [Bannon]. He saw us as early adopters. He figured, if you can get the gays on board, everyone else will follow. It’s why he was so into the whole Milo [Yiannopoulos] thing.”","Robert Mercer was a pioneer in AI and machine translation. He helped invent algorithmic trading – which replaced hedge fund managers with computer programs – and he listened to Wylie’s pitch. It was for a new kind of political message-targeting based on an influential and groundbreaking 2014 paper researched at Cambridge’s Psychometrics Centre, called: “Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans”.","“In politics, the money man is usually the dumbest person in the room. Whereas it’s the opposite way around with Mercer,” says Wylie. “He said very little, but he really listened. He wanted to understand the science. And he wanted proof that it worked.”","And to do that, Wylie needed data.","How Cambridge Analytica acquired the data has been the subject of internal reviews at Cambridge University, of many news articles and much speculation and rumour.","When Nix was interviewed by MPs last month, Damian Collins asked him:","“Does any of your data come from Global Science Research company?”","Nix: “GSR?”","Collins: “Yes.”","Nix: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Collins: “They have not supplied you with data or information?”","Nix: “No.”","Collins: “Your datasets are not based on information you have received from them?”","Nix: “No.”","Collins: “At all?”","Nix: “At all.”","The problem with Nix’s response to Collins is that Wylie has a copy of an executed contract, dated 4 June 2014, which confirms that SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with a company called Global Science Research (GSR), owned by Cambridge-based academic Aleksandr Kogan, specifically premised on the harvesting and processing of Facebook data, so that it could be matched to personality traits and voter rolls.","He has receipts showing that Cambridge Analytica spent $7m to amass this data, about $1m of it with GSR. He has the bank records and wire transfers. Emails reveal Wylie first negotiated with Michal Kosinski, one of the co-authors of the original myPersonality research paper, to use the myPersonality database. But when negotiations broke down, another psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, offered a solution that many of his colleagues considered unethical. He offered to replicate Kosinski and Stillwell’s research and cut them out of the deal. For Wylie it seemed a perfect solution. “Kosinski was asking for $500,000 for the IP but Kogan said he could replicate it and just harvest his own set of data.” (Kosinski says the fee was to fund further research.)","An unethical solution? Dr Aleksandr Kogan Photograph: alex kogan","Kogan then set up GSR to do the work, and proposed to Wylie they use the data to set up an interdisciplinary institute working across the social sciences. “What happened to that idea,” I ask Wylie. “It never happened. I don’t know why. That’s one of the things that upsets me the most.”","It was Bannon’s interest in culture as war that ignited Wylie’s intellectual concept. But it was Robert Mercer’s millions that created a firestorm. Kogan was able to throw money at the hard problem of acquiring personal data: he advertised for people who were willing to be paid to take a personality quiz on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics. At the end of which Kogan’s app, called thisismydigitallife, gave him permission to access their Facebook profiles. And not just theirs, but their friends’ too. On average, each “seeder” – the people who had taken the personality test, around 320,000 in total – unwittingly gave access to at least 160 other people’s profiles, none of whom would have known or had reason to suspect.","What the email correspondence between Cambridge Analytica employees and Kogan shows is that Kogan had collected millions of profiles in a matter of weeks. But neither Wylie nor anyone else at Cambridge Analytica had checked that it was legal. It certainly wasn’t authorised. Kogan did have permission to pull Facebook data, but for academic purposes only. What’s more, under British data protection laws, it’s illegal for personal data to be sold to a third party without consent.","“Facebook could see it was happening,” says Wylie. “Their security protocols were triggered because Kogan’s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use. So they were like, ‘Fine’.”","Kogan maintains that everything he did was legal and he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Cambridge Analytica had its data. This was the foundation of everything it did next – how it extracted psychological insights from the “seeders” and then built an algorithm to profile millions more.","For more than a year, the reporting around what Cambridge Analytica did or didn’t do for Trump has revolved around the question of “psychographics”, but Wylie points out: “Everything was built on the back of that data. The models, the algorithm. Everything. Why wouldn’t you use it in your biggest campaign ever?”","In December 2015, the Guardian’s Harry Davies published the first report about Cambridge Analytica acquiring Facebook data and using it to support Ted Cruz in his campaign to be the US Republican candidate. But it wasn’t until many months later that Facebook took action. And then, all they did was write a letter. In August 2016, shortly before the US election, and two years after the breach took place, Facebook’s lawyers wrote to Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and told him the data had been illicitly obtained and that “GSR was not authorised to share or sell it”. They said it must be deleted immediately.","“I already had. But literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,” says Wylie. “Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.”","There were multiple copies of it. It had been emailed in unencrypted files.","Cambridge Analytica rejected all allegations the Observer put to them.","Dr Kogan – who later changed his name to Dr Spectre, but has subsequently changed it back to Dr Kogan – is still a faculty member at Cambridge University, a senior research associate. But what his fellow academics didn’t know until Kogan revealed it in emails to the Observer (although Cambridge University says that Kogan told the head of the psychology department), is that he is also an associate professor at St Petersburg University. Further research revealed that he’s received grants from the Russian government to research “Stress, health and psychological wellbeing in social networks”. The opportunity came about on a trip to the city to visit friends and family, he said.","There are other dramatic documents in Wylie’s stash, including a pitch made by Cambridge Analytica to Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil producer. In an email dated 17 July 2014, about the US presidential primaries, Nix wrote to Wylie: “We have been asked to write a memo to Lukoil (the Russian oil and gas company) to explain to them how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business. Nix said that “they understand behavioural microtargeting in the context of elections” but that they were “failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers”. The work, he said, would be “shared with the CEO of the business”, a former Soviet oil minister and associate of Putin, Vagit Alekperov.","“It didn’t make any sense to me,” says Wylie. “I didn’t understand either the email or the pitch presentation we did. Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?”","Mueller’s investigation traces the first stages of the Russian operation to disrupt the 2016 US election back to 2014, when the Russian state made what appears to be its first concerted efforts to harness the power of America’s social media platforms, including Facebook. And it was in late summer of the same year that Cambridge Analytica presented the Russian oil company with an outline of its datasets, capabilities and methodology. The presentation had little to do with “consumers”. Instead, documents show it focused on election disruption techniques. The first slide illustrates how a “rumour campaign” spread fear in the 2007 Nigerian election – in which the company worked – by spreading the idea that the “election would be rigged”. The final slide, branded with Lukoil’s logo and that of SCL Group and SCL Elections, headlines its “deliverables”: “psychographic messaging”.","Robert Mercer with his daughter Rebekah. Photograph: Sean Zanni/Getty Images","Lukoil is a private company, but its CEO, Alekperov, answers to Putin, and it’s been used as a vehicle of Russian influence in Europe and elsewhere – including in the Czech Republic, where in 2016 it was revealed that an adviser to the strongly pro-Russian Czech president was being paid by the company.","When I asked Bill Browder – an Anglo-American businessman who is leading a global campaign for a Magnitsky Act to enforce sanctions against Russian individuals – what he made of it, he said: “Everyone in Russia is subordinate to Putin. One should be highly suspicious of any Russian company pitching anything outside its normal business activities.”","Last month, Nix told MPs on the parliamentary committee investigating fake news: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do not have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”","There’s no evidence that Cambridge Analytica ever did any work for Lukoil. What these documents show, though, is that in 2014 one of Russia’s biggest companies was fully briefed on: Facebook, microtargeting, data, election disruption.","Cambridge Analytica is “Chris’s Frankenstein”, says a friend of his. “He created it. It’s his data Frankenmonster. And now he’s trying to put it right.”","Only once has Wylie made the case of pointing out that he was 24 at the time. But he was. He thrilled to the intellectual possibilities of it. He didn’t think of the consequences. And I wonder how much he’s processed his own role or responsibility in it. Instead, he’s determined to go on the record and undo this thing he has created.","Because the past few months have been like watching a tornado gathering force. And when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something – his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead – it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold. Dealing with someone trained in information warfare has its own particular challenges, and his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great BritishBake Off. And not everyone’s a fan. Any number of ex-colleagues – even the ones who love him – call him “Machiavellian”. Another described the screaming matches he and Nix would have.","“What do your parents make of your decision to come forward?” I ask him.","“They get it. My dad sent me a cartoon today, which had two characters hanging off a cliff, and the first one’s saying ‘Hang in there.’ And the other is like: ‘Fuck you.’”","Which are you?","“Probably both.”","What isn’t in doubt is what a long, fraught journey it has been to get to this stage. And how fearless he is.","After many months, I learn the terrible, dark backstory that throws some light on his determination, and which he discusses candidly. At six, while at school, Wylie was abused by a mentally unstable person. The school tried to cover it up, blaming his parents, and a long court battle followed. Wylie’s childhood and school career never recovered. His parents – his father is a doctor and his mother is a psychiatrist – were wonderful, he says. “But they knew the trajectory of people who are put in that situation, so I think it was particularly difficult for them, because they had a deeper understanding of what that does to a person long term.”","Facebook has denied and denied this. It has failed in its duties to respect the law","Paul-Olivier Dehaye","He says he grew up listening to psychologists discuss him in the third person, and, aged 14, he successfully sued the British Columbia Ministry of Education and forced it to change its inclusion policies around bullying. What I observe now is how much he loves the law, lawyers, precision, order. I come to think of his pink hair as a false-flag operation. What he cannot tolerate is bullying.","Is what Cambridge Analytica does akin to bullying?","“I think it’s worse than bullying,” Wylie says. “Because people don’t necessarily know it’s being done to them. At least bullying respects the agency of people because they know. So it’s worse, because if you do not respect the agency of people, anything that you’re doing after that point is not conducive to a democracy. And fundamentally, information warfare is not conducive to democracy.”","Russia, Facebook, Trump, Mercer, Bannon, Brexit. Every one of these threads runs through Cambridge Analytica. Even in the past few weeks, it seems as if the understanding of Facebook’s role has broadened and deepened. The Mueller indictments were part of that, but Paul-Olivier Dehaye – a data expert and academic based in Switzerland, who published some of the first research into Cambridge Analytica’s processes– says it’s become increasingly apparent that Facebook is “abusive by design”. If there is evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, it will be in the platform’s data flows, he says. And Wylie’s revelations only move it on again.","“Facebook has denied and denied and denied this,” Dehaye says when told of the Observer’s new evidence. “It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law. It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","The great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijacked","Read more","Facebook denies that the data transfer was a breach. In addition, a spokesperson said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules. Both Aleksandr Kogan as well as the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Millions of people’s personal information was stolen and used to target them in ways they wouldn’t have seen, and couldn’t have known about, by a mercenary outfit, Cambridge Analytica, who, Wylie says, “would work for anyone”. Who would pitch to Russian oil companies. Would they subvert elections abroad on behalf of foreign governments?","It occurs to me to ask Wylie this one night.","“Yes.”","Nato or non-Nato?","“Either. I mean they’re mercenaries. They’ll work for pretty much anyone who pays.”","It’s an incredible revelation. It also encapsulates all of the problems of outsourcing – at a global scale, with added cyberweapons. And in the middle of it all are the public – our intimate family connections, our “likes”, our crumbs of personal data, all sucked into a swirling black hole that’s expanding and growing and is now owned by a politically motivated billionaire.","The Facebook data is out in the wild. And for all Wylie’s efforts, there’s no turning the clock back.","Tamsin Shaw, a philosophy professor at New York University, and the author of a recent New York Review of Books article on cyberwar and the Silicon Valley economy, told me that she’d pointed to the possibility of private contractors obtaining cyberweapons that had at least been in part funded by US defence.","She calls Wylie’s disclosures “wild” and points out that “the whole Facebook project” has only been allowed to become as vast and powerful as it has because of the US national security establishment.","“It’s a form of very deep but soft power that’s been seen as an asset for the US. Russia has been so explicit about this, paying for the ads in roubles and so on. It’s making this point, isn’t it? That Silicon Valley is a US national security asset that they’ve turned on itself.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

For further reading, our Managing Director @SuzSha spoke to AdNews about the debacle. If you have questions or would like to chat further, reach out to us here or on Twitter @wearesocialau","What happened?","On the 18th of March, both The New York Times and The Guardian UK published reports alleging Cambridge Analytica harvested the Facebook profiles of 50 million users unlawfully in order to hypertarget voters in US and UK elections and political activities. More recently, the firm has worked to convince voters to vote for Trump in the 2016 US presidential election, as well as to vote leave in the UK European Referendum campaign.","As a result of this, Facebook has met with massive criticism from consumers and politicians. People are calling for Facebook to answer questions about the so-called “leak,” and there has been a movement for people and brands to delete their Facebook pages. Furthermore, Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have been called upon to appear before both Congress and the UK Parliament to answer questions about this data and how it was used to influence the elections.","As a consequence of this and the negative coverage, the share price of Facebook has declined significantly (approx. 18% as of 28th March).","What was unethical / unlawful?","Cambridge Analytica allegedly built up the consumer insights pool legitimately through a personality predictions survey and app on Facebook called 'thisisyourdigitallife.' As part of the program, the research team paid 27,000 individuals a small fee to take a personality quiz and download the app, which scraped private information and data from their profiles. However, after giving the app permission, it also accessed the information and data of all their friends on Facebook.","This version of the API was launched in April 2010. It was announced that it would shut down at f8 in April 2014 and officially close on April 30, 2015. Reasons stated at the time by Facebook for this change was to “put people first” and “give users more control of their data.\"","What Facebook is doing about it","Facebook has banned Cambridge Analytica and its parent company SCL from the platform","Facebook has hired an independent forensic investigation firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica, which it said the firm had agreed to comply with","Curtailing data given to apps: By default, developers using Facebook Login will now receive only a user’s name, profile photo, and email address when someone signs in through Facebook. Further information, such as their Facebook posts, will require the developer to receive permission from Facebook","Additionally, Facebook will now cut off apps’ access to an account’s data when that person hasn’t used the app for three months","Within the next month, Facebook will place a tool at the top of the News Feed that gives people a way to disable apps","The company also plans to “investigate all apps that had access to large amounts” in the past to ensure nothing was abused and tell users if it’s discovered that their data was mishandled","To do that, Facebook says it will look for “suspicious activity” among the companies it investigates and “conduct a full audit” of them - if they decline the audit, they’ll be banned from Facebook","Developers that misused “personally identifiable information” will also be banned. The investigation applies to developers who were on the platform during or before 2014, when Facebook made a change that limited how much data they had access to","Facebook has agreed to appear before Congress and answer questions about the data and how it affected the elections","Facebook is revamping the platform’s security settings to make it easier for people to find and edit the personal information that is stored about them. It’s important to note that these settings already exist on the platform, Facebook is just making it easier to find them. This was, in all likelihood, prepared in response to GDPR and not just the Cambridge Analytica issue","In response to the crisis, Facebook published print ads in US and UK newspapers admitting that they have a responsibility to protect the data of the users","What this means for our clients and other advertisers","Whilst the public outcry is largely centered around the unauthorised use of data and manipulation for political purposes, everyone involved in marketing on Facebook should be aware of the increased scrutiny their targeting activity will be exposed to. At We Are Social, our Facebook user targeting is only ever based on data that consumers have given permission to be used, so none of our clients' ad bookings on Facebook need to be withdrawn for data reasons. However, there are a few considerations for our clients and other advertisers springing from the debate:","Ensure when consumer data is required, the value exchange offered to consumers is strong enough (Discounts offered, time saved, other benefits), as consumers will be warier of sharing data","Consider holding off on running any hyper-targeted ads that use personal data for the next few weeks and review messaging to ensure it cannot be misconstrued as manipulative","Review and simplify data policies and warnings, potentially publishing a data transparency statement piece on their website; ensure third party data providers comply with data legislation; in the rare cases where data is obtained from brokers, it may make sense to instead work with influencers or publishers who are trusted to have their audience's data.","Other questions","Hasn’t Facebook been collecting our data since the beginning?","Yes, Facebook and most apps collect private information from your profile and are clear about this when you accept their terms. This is part of the value exchange with the user for access to the platform and apps. Users are able to disable sharing of specific data points or sharing data with specific apps. What makes this incident different is the data was passed on to a third party after it was collected and not deleted when Facebook requested. Facebook say this breached their policies.","Do we think advertisers should stop using Facebook as a marketing and ad channel?","Some brands may feel Facebook could have done more in preventing an unethical data breach (through tighter auditing of third parties) and choose not to work with them in future. Mozilla Foundation, Pep Boys, Sonos, and German bank Commerzbank have pulled advertising from Facebook. Sonos for one week only.","We will continue to monitor the situation but our view is that the majority of brands will continue to use Facebook’s targeting options to reach consumers. Brand content that is from an advertiser and relevant to the the user should not be a case for concern. We have not seen a drop off in user numbers (although it is too soon to comment definitely on this).","Some in the industry have questioned why brands would pull out of advertising on Facebook when they have been demanding more and more personal data for targeting from Facebook to enable them to run hyper-targeted campaigns","What appears to have caused concern with users is that this particular incident involves political advertising, where content was not clearly marked as coming from a political party, with little clarity on who funded the advertising as well as the veracity of some of claims in the content.","How have consumers reacted?","There have been around 450K mentions of #deletefacebook since the story broke (to 15-28th March). Elon Musk is one notable deleter, having deleted his personal Facebook account and that of Tesla. However, Elon himself commented that he didn’t actually know the pages even existed and the number of regular users who have deleted their accounts has been unnoticeable. For the average consumer, deleting Facebook is easier said than done.","The issue is that Facebook has become such an integrated part of our social infrastructure, with Messenger and Events being a large part of connecting people. As such, people are likely to continue to use Facebook, and due to its reach and scale, it will likely maintain its status within the media mix.","What is likely to happen, though, is that users will become more aware of the data technology companies and social platforms hold about them and be more critical of what they sign up for and how their data is used.","Our conclusion","Facebook is doing what it can to accommodate the demands of the consumers in regards to their data, but we expect to see greater regulation in this area. Facebook has probably already been preparing for a higher level of privacy control and transparency in response to the upcoming GDPR regulation.","However, as we have seen in other industries, brands are facing more and more pressure to take responsibility for what happens at every stage of the supply chain, and technology companies and social platforms are likely to come under the same pressure in the future. Even though Facebook received legally binding assurance from Cambridge Analytica that the data had been deleted, this will be far from enough in the future. They will be held accountable for suppliers or third-party partners misusing the data they collect, and they will be responsible for protecting their consumers and their data in an ethical way.","The tighter control of third party apps and usage of their data should prevent future issues of this scale, but as social media data regulation is a new area, further unforeseen issues are to be expected. Just following the Cambridge Analytica case, it was revealed that Facebook has been logging calls and texts on some Android phones as far back as 2015. We should be ready to amend our approach to work and targeting if other situations arise where Facebook or any other platform is in the crosshairs.","We believe in the power of social insight to drive business value.

Obama Campaign Manager Admits Facebook Sided with Obama in 2012 and Allowed MASSIVE Data Mining","text":["If you still felt sketchy about social media companies leaning left so hard they fall into activist territory, then buckle up. This bombshell should blow apart any doubt.","According to a recent discovery first reported on by IJR, Carol Davidson, former director of integration and media analytics for Obama for America, said Facebook found out that the campaign was utilizing Facebook in such a way that it was data mining user data by “sucking out the whole social graph.”","Essentially, this came in the form of a Facebook application that once signed up to would allow the Obama campaign to look at the user’s friend list. The campaign could then use that info to append their email list. They called this “targeted sharing.”","Facebook apparently became aware of the Obama campaign’s activity. Davidsen says they were “surprised” at the campaign’s actions, however, she says that Facebook representatives came to the campaign office and told them that they could continue to do it because Facebook was on Obama’s side.","Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing.","She’s also sure that Facebook did the same for the other side, though IJR has yet to receive any confirmation from the Romney campaign.","Whether or not Facebook did allow data mining for Republicans, their willingness to sit back and allow the Obama campaign to gather information about their users in order to target them for potential votes is bad. What’s worse is the fact that they did so just because they fell in line with the campaign itself.","The question now is just how much is a social media network willing to allow a campaign, activist group, or politician to get away with due to the fact that they line up politically or ideologically.","But more frightening than that. If Davidsen’s guess as to whether or not they were allowing the same to happen on the Republican end proves to be wrong, then it’s scary to think that elections are being meddled in by the very corporations who have proclaimed they will fight it tooth and nail.","What we have here is an admission from a Democratic campaign manager that the most powerful social media platform in the first world is currently lending its untold amounts of data to a specific political party’s purposes.","This is a startling revelation, and one that only exacerbates fears and adds to the mounting proof that these companies that serve as the gatekeepers for news and thought really are in the tank for a specific party.

What they unwittingly did was give their data to Cambridge Analytica.","But that’s the point — people give away alot of very personal information to Facebook. Then they just as quickly give it away to third parties without really knowing what in heaven’s name they’re doing with the information.","Here are the three basic ways we’re handing over very personal information — our birthday, our “likes,” our preferences, who we’re friends with online — and how quickly it can be taken from us.","1. The simple act ofsigning upfor Facebook","It’s that simple. Some people think Facebook doesn’t have all that much information on them because they rarely use it. You may be a lurker. How much data can Facebook really have on you?","A lot! If you’re curious about what kind of data Facebook has about you, you can follow these steps to download your personal Facebook history. In these archives you’ll find fun things you probably never thought were stored on a server somewhere about you.","The archive contains a list of IP addresses that you’ve used to logged into your Facebook account, ads that you clicked on, and cell phone numbers associated with your account.","Facebook also tracks this type of data you entered onto the platform:","A facial recognition ID that is associated with your photo and is used to identify images of you","Your maiden name","Credit card information","Your hometown","Your political views","Your addresses","Any networks you’re associated with — like colleges or companies you belonged to","2. The even simpler act of using Facebook","Facebook keeps detailed data of all your preferences and every one of your “likes” — and it leverages that information for super-precise ad targeting. By reacting to Facebook posts, it’s kind of like you’re participating in an ongoing consumer survey exclusively for Facebook.","Your activity log can give you a pretty good idea of your Facebook behavior over time. It’s a record of all your activities from today all the way back to the day you signed up for your account. Here, you’ll find every like, :haha:, :wow:, :angry:, :love:, and :sad: reaction you’ve ever made to a Facebook post; every video, song, and photo you’ve looked at, listened to, posted, and been tagged in. It also keeps every change to your profile you’ve ever made.","3. Signing in to third-party apps through Facebook","You know that convenient option of logging into a third-party app with your Facebook credentials? Once you click “continue,” you’re allowing this app — it could be Spotify, Farmville, or, say, a survey being conducted by a Russian-American academic connected to Cambridge Analytica — to access a ton of the precious personal data that Facebook has on you.","For example, if you use Tinder via Facebook, you have to hand over at least some basic information about your public profile, which includes your name, your gender, and anything else you posted publicly about yourself.","By default, the app also asks for access to a complete list of your friends, what genders you are interested in, your birthday, your work and educational history, any photo you’ve ever uploaded or are tagged in, any pages and groups you like, and your email address.","Unless you edit the default settings upon your first Tinder login — and you probably don’t — you automatically give the dating app all this data.","These are only a few of the data points that apps may ask for. Here’s a complete list.","Back in 2014 — when the academic linked to Cambridge Analytica, Aleksandr Kogan, used his app to collect data — Facebook users were also able to give third-party apps permission to gather not just personal information but also the information of their friends. At the time, this data included things like the check-ins, locations, and interests of a user’s friend.","“The news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica should serve as a reminder of the inevitable privacy risks in a world where a near-endless stream of personal information is collected indefinitely stored, analyzed, and re-used by marketers, identity thieves, and professional government snoops,” Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told BuzzFeed News through a spokesperson."],"isopubdate":""}

The Intercept first reported their ties and Chancellor’s employment at Facebook last year. According to Facebook’s website, he still works there.","A screenshot from Global Science Research’s certificate of incorporation.","Companies House","Global Science Research was paid more than $800,000 to build an app in June 2014 for Cambridge Analytica that was used to harvest Facebook user data through a personality quiz that scraped data from its respondents as well as data from their friends, according to a report in the New York Times. Facebook’s app developer policy at the time allowed developers to siphon data on users’ friend networks, too, but the company says that policy has since been updated to let users choose what data they’ll let Facebook share about them.","In a statement Friday night, Facebook said about 270,000 users downloaded the app, though the New York Times reported that Kogan and Chancellor’s company provided about 50 million user profiles to Cambridge Analytica, which may have been possible through connections to the hundreds or thousands of friends one may have on Facebook. I asked Facebook for comment on Chancellor on Saturday and will update when I hear back.","Cambridge Analytica was hired to work for the Trump campaign in June 2016, about six months after the Guardian revealed the company was using tens of millions Facebook users’ data in its work on then-contender Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign without their knowledge. At that point in 2015, Facebook acknowledged that its user data was being misused by Cambridge Analytica, but the company didn’t alert users or issue a public statement. The company did, however, contact Cambridge Analytica, as well as Kogan and Christopher Wylie, who used to work at Cambridge Analytica, to demand they destroy the data and certify that they did so. Facebook said that although the company received confirmations that the data had been deleted, several days ago it learned that was not the case. The New York Times reported that its reporters had seen a portion of the data set Global Science Research provided to Cambridge Analytica.","Krogan and Chancellor courted Facebook users to take their quiz by posting it to the Mechanical Turk marketplace, a platform run by Amazon that pays digital laborers anywhere from a few cents to a few dollars for performing menial tasks online, like flagging porn or looking for broken links. Their quiz, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered $1 or $2, but required participants install the Facebook app, be American, and allow access to their friend data.","Chancellor’s employee profile on Facebook’s website says he’s a “quantitative social psychologist” who studied at the University of Cambridge and the University of California, Riverside.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

The result could be a hearing that exposes both of those tech giants – whose data is not known to have been taken by Cambridge Analytica – to uncomfortable questions about the extent to which they profit from their users’ most personal data, too.","A spokesman for Zuckerberg, who last week expressed his openness to appear at a hearing, said Facebook is still reviewing the request. A spokeswoman for Twitter declined comment. Spokespeople for Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The Senate’s upcoming hearing is hardly the only major political and legal challenge facing Facebook. Earlier Monday, a powerful U.S. watchdog agency, the Federal Trade Commission, said it would investigate Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica incident. The news initially sent Facebook’s stock price tumbling, though it reversed those losses by the end of the day as the market surged.","For the U.S. government, a key question is whether Facebook's business practices violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over another privacy mishap. As a result, the new probe carries the potential for steep fines and other penalties on the social giant, which is facing similar investigations in Europe.","“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” Tom Pahl, the acting director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement Monday. “Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","For its part, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Friday that it had obtained data from the social network “in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws.\"","On Capitol Hill, lawmakers on two panels -- the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee – already have invited Zuckerberg to testify at two upcoming hearings. But lawmakers have not indicated if they would seek to subpoena the Facebook executive if he declined to attend or sought to send another company official in his place.","The Senate Judiciary Committee panel, however, could prove to be the toughest political territory for Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers. Lawmakers there have been seething over Facebook, Google and Twitter since last fall, when the panel grilled those tech giants’ lawyers about another issue – Russian propaganda that spread on their platforms around the 2016 election.","Questions about Trump, the Russian government’s disinformation efforts and the presidential race are likely to return at the scheduled April 10 session – on top of new, uncomfortable queries about the ways that the biggest brands in the tech industry collect and protect information about their users. Some of the Judiciary Committee’s members, including Republican Sen. John Kennedy (La.) and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), are regular critics of the tech industry’s privacy practices.","On Monday, Blumenthal said that federal officials investigating Facebook should be “penetrating and prompt in holding [it] accountable for apparent illegal action.” He even suggested in a statement that “possible remedies should include damage payments to users, and other court-ordered action.”","For now, the Senate Judiciary Committee session is set to “broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” the committee announced Monday. “It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.”","Tony RommTony Romm is a technology policy reporter at The Washington Post.

{"originalurl":"http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/03/what-is-cambridge-analytica-and-who-is-christopher-wylie.html","title":"What Is Cambridge Analytica and Who Is Christopher Wylie?","text":["What You Need to Understand About Facebook and Cambridge Analytica","Late Friday night, Facebook published an unusual announcement to its newsroom blog. “We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook,” deputy general counsel Paul Grewal wrote. SCL had illegitimately obtained data about Facebook users, and had apparently not destroyed that data when Facebook ordered it to in 2015. Consequently, the company was no longer allowed access to Facebook’s platform. “We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook,” Grewal concluded.","The next morning, it became clear just why SCL and Cambridge Analytica had been suspended so abruptly, and at such an odd hour: because the New York Times and the Observer were prepping major investigative stories about the company’s use of Facebook data, based on documents and other information from a 26-year-old whistle-blower named Christopher Wylie.","Both stories are excellent, and help us better understand exactly what Cambridge Analytica did during the 2016 election (and the primaries before it). But there are a few points worth pulling out and emphasizing.","Facebook was being used as it’s designed, and that’s the problem.","In 2014, while working at Cambridge Analytica, Wylie hired a University of Cambridge professor named Aleksandr Kogan to build a database of psychometric profiles. Cambridge Analytica — funded by the right-wing billionaire Mercer family and advised by then–Breitbart editor-in-chief Steve Bannon — hoped to use the data to target political advertising and influence voter behavior. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk freelance boards, Kogan hired around 270,000 people to fill out a survey in an app that they would install in their Facebook accounts.","Facebook apps, like FarmVille, extend the platform’s usability, but in installing them, users often give third-party developers like Kogan access to a significant amount of their own data. Worse, in 2014, when Kogan’s app was gathering data, Facebook’s terms of service allowed developers to request access to an app installer’s friends as well.","In other words, each of the 270,000 people who were paid to install the app also gave up a significant amount of data about their Facebook friends as well — meaning that from the original 270,000 subjects, Kogan managed to obtain as many as 50 million profiles, including information like locations, job and educational histories, and pages liked. Facebook has since changed privacy settings that mean you can’t be data-betrayed by your inconsiderate or careless friends. But at the time, there was nothing about what Kogan was doing with his app that broke any of Facebook’s rules. It wasn’t until he passed that data on to Cambridge Analytica that he put himself in violation of Facebook’s terms of use.","Facebook has therefore insisted that it was not party to a “breach” of user data. You could argue that this is a semantic argument, largely designed to protect the company from SEC regulations that would have required them to alert users that their data had been mishandled and distributed without explicit permission. Certainly, user trust has been breached, even if no particular server or database was illegally or maliciously accessed.","But I actually agree with Facebook on this point: It wasn’t breached; Kogan obtained profile data perfectly legitimately. I just don’t think that’s a good defense. As hardly needs stating at this point, Facebook’s business model is built on gathering data about its users. (“We … built models to exploit what we knew about [people] and target their inner demons,” Wylie tells the Observer. “That was the basis the entire company was built on.” He’s talking about Cambridge Analytica, but the statement is equally true of Facebook.) You can argue that it was a bad idea to allow a surveillance-advertising company to grow to the size and influence of Facebook. But everyone can agree that the data Facebook has gathered on its users should be better protected, and that users should have better knowledge of and control over that data. Kogan was able to access profiles of 50 million users by paying a mere 270,000 users to install an app — and able to pass that data on to a third party without Facebook’s knowledge — because Facebook made it remarkably easy to obtain information about its users, not because he did something particularly nefarious.","If this has happened once, it’s probably happened more than once.","Kogan ran afoul of the rules by passing the data he’d obtained to a third party — Cambridge Analytica. He’d presented the app to Facebook and to its users as a project gathering for academic research, but then had turned around and given it to a company that had not been named or identified, and which sought to use the data for political, not academic, purposes.","But it’s worth noting that the only reason any of us know that this happened is because of Cambridge Analytica’s prominence in the news. Facebook itself only seems to have become aware that Kogan’s data was being misused in late 2015, after a Guardian report outlined the company’s data-harvesting techniques. Having learned that millions of its users’ data was now in the hands of a company to whom no such permissions had been granted, Facebook demanded that Cambridge Analytica delete that data — and then never followed up.","The fact that all this data was obtained legitimately in the first place, and that the discovery that it had been mishandled was met with only token objection by Facebook, is not, to put it mildly, confidence-inspiring. If the Guardian had never reported on the Cruz campaign’s contract with Cambridge Analytica, would Facebook (or any of us) even know that profile data on so many users was out there? And given that, shouldn’t we be assuming that this same thing — shady mass data-harvesting of Facebook profiles, to be kept on third-party servers — has happened more than once?","Facebook has known about this for a long time, and has done nothing.","The Observer and Times stories are valuable for the level of detail they bring to Cambridge Analytica’s practices, and for the attention they draw to Facebook’s lax privacy protections. But much of the key information in both stories could also be found in an Intercept story from last year — and in the aforementioned Guardian story from December 2015.","It’s easy to be cynical about the sudden attention the story is now getting from the public, given that we’ve had two years to process Cambridge Analytica’s methods. And surely some of the attention is unwarranted — the result of sensationalized chatter about Cambridge Analytica’s overstated role in Trump’s victory. (More on that in a minute.) But Facebook has been silent over the course of those two years, too. To its credit, it’s changed app permissions so that developers can no longer access such a wide network of profiles. Yet even after it was aware that Cambridge Analytica was in possession of mishandled profile data, it did nothing beyond send a letter. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted,” Wylie told the Observer. It’s hard to square that with Facebook lawyer Grewal’s claim that “[p]rotecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do.”","The trouble is with Facebook, not (necessarily) Cambridge Analytica.","Trump’s victory in 2016 was so unexpected, and so close, that a whole cottage industry of explanations for his victory — from the prosaic to the conspiracy-driven — has emerged in its wake. Early coverage of Cambridge Analytica tended toward the sensational: Soon after the election, the Guardian called Cambridge Analytica’s influence “sinister,” and it was suggested in the woollier corners of Twitter that its “psychometric profiles” were not just a deciding factor in the election but a particularly dangerous one.","The truth is that there’s very little evidence that Cambridge Analytica’s particular methods have any different effect on voting behavior than any other digital political campaign efforts. Dave Karpf, a professor at Georgetown and expert in political advocacy on the internet, has called Cambridge Analytica the “Theranos of political data” — a company with “a tremendous marketing department, coupled with a team of research scientists who provide on virtually none of those marketing promises.”","Given the narrowness of Trump’s margins, could Cambridge Analytica have provided the extra nudge that pushed him across the finish line? Sure! And, yes, it’s awfully interesting that Cambridge Analytica employed a Russian-American professor who received funding from the Russian government. But until more reporting is done, that’s all it is — interesting. As Cambridge Analytica itself has resentfully pointed out, the Obama campaign was undertook similar Facebook data-gathering efforts. Those campaigns were aboveboard, and the uses of the data made clear to those who signed up — no small distinction — but they still used Facebook in much the same way. Focusing on Cambridge Analytica as a uniquely sinister actor in the election (or in the world of data acquisition or voter-targeting) ignores exactly how easy, and how mundane, their data-harvesting really was — and how vulnerable your Facebook data really is."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie.

Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.","But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.","Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February.","“It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Mr. Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side.","Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault.","“This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew.","The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used.","Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.”","Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.","“The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Mr. Stamos tweeted.","The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data.","“Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.”","Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited.","“Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Mr. Albright said.","Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said.","This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers.","There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations.","On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter.","Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie.","By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports.","In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as “a curious and naïve 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica.","“I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.”","His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data.","Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting.","In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it.","Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data.","“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said.","In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article.","Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California — called for investigations of the Facebook data leak.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,” said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee.","Correction:","An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Senator Amy Klobuchar on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is a Democratic member of the committee, not the ranking Democratic member. (The ranking Democrat is Senator Dianne Feinstein.)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.","It's worth noting that according to the Times report, Stamos was encouraged by Facebook's communications team to tweet in defence of the company as news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke — but only after every word had been approved.","Stamos, whose original staff of 120 people has been whittled down to 3 people, is now having his tweets dictated to him by comms staff.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds","Read more","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.","Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

{"originalurl":"https://medium.com/@cfhorgan/why-your-data-matters-6b78f396521c","title":"Why your data matters – colin horgan – Medium","text":["Why your data matters","You’re not being told what to think – something much weirder is happening","image via Facebook","For all the questions answered by the recent revelations regarding Cambridge Analytica’s alleged data harvesting — how the company got it, what they claimed to learn from it, how they claimed to use it, and how Facebook, which allowed Cambridge Analytica to do what it did, reacted — there is still one many people will have not heard. Namely: So what? Why does it matter so much that our data is being accessed, anyway?","A perpetual sticking point in the ongoing conversation about privacy is that, by and large, the only time people are aware that their personal information — or even their web browsing activity — has been monitored or harvested, is when they see a banner ad for a consumer product they either recently purchased or thought about purchasing. And for the most part, that kind of tracking appears to be utterly benign. Someone wants to sell me something I want? That seems… fine?","However, the same information that has been collected in order to target us with an advertisement has also been collected by other companies for uses we’re almost always unaware of. Advertising is just one facet of the data industrial complex that has erupted as the internet has become “social” — the modern era where people have voluntarily shared critical pieces of identifying information (birth dates, maiden names, high schools, pet names) in exchange for access to a stream of photos and updates from their friends and acquaintances.","Still, it’s difficult to make the mental leap between data nudging you into buying something, and it being used to tell you to vote one way or another. But here’s the thing about social media and searches that are based on the reams of personal data we constantly provide: it’s not that Facebook or Google tell us what to think; it’s that they suggest what we should think about.","This is an important distinction to make, because it means that if you’re following a news story, a fashion trend, a sports scandal, or a social movement, you might worry less that you’re being convinced one way another about any of them, and more that you’re thinking about them in the first place.","A comically terrifying example of this framework construction emerged in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.","Two Facebook groups were created by Russian operatives to appeal to Americans — one, a purported Texas Secessionist group called Heart of Texas broadly aimed at conservatives; the other, United Muslims of America, designed to appeal to liberals. At one point, both groups decided to hold rallies, and as it happened, those rallies were organized (by their Russian creators) to occur at roughly the same place and the same time in Houston.","Sure enough, members of the two Facebook groups showed up, and followers of the Heart of Texas group and the United Muslims of America faced off across Travis Street in Houston in late May, 2016. The Houston Chronicle reported at the time that Heart of Texas had even encouraged its members to bring firearms to the demonstration, and that one man did. Andrew Gomez brought along his AR-15. It had all the trappings of a protest and counterprotest. And it was — sort of.","The key is that neither of the two Facebook groups were explicitly focused on politics or political candidates. Instead, they were issues-based. As the Washington Post’s Casey Michel reported, over time, Heart of Texas, for example, gradually took on a far-right tone, “stressing Texas’s status as a ‘Christian state,’ or touting the Second Amendment as a ‘symbol of freedom… so we would forever be free from any tyranny.’ Some of the page’s contributors talked about the need to ‘keep Texas Texan.’” By the time Facebook took the page down, it had a quarter of a million followers.","And how would people come across a group like Heart of Texas? Most likely, the data did it. At some point, content from the group would have appeared on their screen. Whether it was shared by a friend or recommended in some other fashion, the platform prioritized it for some reason. Maybe Heart of Texas members had in the past expressed concern about Texas seceding, or immigration, or gun ownership in a post. Or maybe they liked when their friend did. Maybe their search history eventually brought the group higher up in the results.","Or maybe it was something else, perhaps an aspect of their profile derived entirely by an algorithmic computation — an opaque conclusion drawn from a thousand data points. As researcher and frequent New York Times contributor Zeynep Tufekci explained recently, the information that’s used to determine what you see around you, including on Facebook, comes from all kinds of places. “Every status update you ever typed, every Messenger conversation, every place you logged in from, all your photographs that you uploaded there. If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those and analyzes them, too,” she told a TED audience in September. “Increasingly, it tries to match you with your offline data” — the kind it can acquire from private firms that collect information about your purchases or other activity in the real world.","Was each of those quarter million members of Heart of Texas concerned with Texas secession? It’s doubtful. But, when presented with the concept, did it open cognitive space for related ideas — about borders or immigration or basic nationalism — to occupy? It sure seems like it! Enough, anyway, for some of them to literally take to the streets in their defence. Heart of Texas might never have explicitly told its members to vote for Donald Trump, or even for the Republican party. Instead, it told people what to think about — issues that would deepen the political divide and drive people to extremes.","All of this is based on data, as well as programs that use that data to optimize engagement — either to make sure we keep watching videos on YouTube, or that we’re liking more posts on Facebook, or that we’re searching more things on Google. The programs quickly learn about what we enjoy and what our friends enjoy, what makes us angry or happy — in short, what keeps us looking at the screen.","Before too long, that data has brought us to a fake rally organized by Russian trolls, but which we are convinced is about defending democracy. This is part of the reason why your data matters. Today, it’s being used to sell you a shirt; tomorrow, it’s making you wear something a bit less comfortable."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

It said: “We were approached by individuals from Cambridge Analytica on multiple occasions, but we declined to move forward.","“As a matter of company policy, we do not and have never worked on or been involved with elections or political campaigns anywhere in the world.","“We learned today that an employee, in 2013-2014, engaged in an entirely personal capacity with people associated with Cambridge Analytica. We are looking into this and will take the appropriate action.”","The admission is an embarrassing volte-face for the secretive firm, which had denied any relationship whatsoever with Cambridge Analytica in a statement to the Observer last year.","The Facebook data at the heart of the scandal was originally obtained by an academic named Aleksandr Kogan, who built a survey app called “thisismydigitallife”. In addition to collecting information from survey respondents, the app obtained data from friends of respondents.","Kogan, who was believed to have obtained data on around 50m Facebook profiles through the app, subsequently set up a company called Global Science Research, which shared the data with Cambridge Analytica.","The Guardian has seen emails that appear to show a developer discussing the possibility of replicating the work of a University of Cambridge professor and encouraging people to take a personality survey.","The emails appear to show the developer, who has previously described himself as working with Palantir, discussing the subject with Wylie.","“I had [a] left field idea,” the developer wrote in a May 2014 email. “What about replicating the work of the Cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to Facebook? For example compare your personality to your friends app or some other spin to entice people to take a test.”","A second email dated July 2014 appears to show the same developer asking another academic if he could “share some Facebook credentials with me (user/pass) – I need to test our version of the app?”","The academic replied with a URL referencing Kogan’s personality survey and a phrase that included his initials.","In his testimony before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, Wylie had claimed that they had several meetings with Palantir and that the firm had informal access to the Kogan data.","“There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data,” he said. “That was not an official contract between Palantir and CA, but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data. And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.”","Wylie said that Alexander Nix, the chief executive of SCL, was interested in Palantir’s work and that when he joined SCL, one of the first emails he received was asking him about Palantir.","Nix was suspended from his position at Cambridge Analytica last week following an undercover sting by Channel 4 News in which he was filmed describing how the firm could use blackmail against clients’ political opponents."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}
{"originalurl":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/facebook-doesnt-care/551684/","title":"Facebook Only Cares About Facebook - The Atlantic","text":["Facebook’s crushing blow to independent media arrived last fall in Slovakia, Cambodia, Guatemala, and three other nations.","The social giant removed stories by these publishers from users’ News Feeds, hiding them in a new, hard-to-find stream. These independent publishers reported that they lost as much as 80 percent of their audience during this experiment.","Facebook doesn’t care. At least, it usually seems that way.","Despite angry pushback in the six countries affected by Facebook’s algorithmic tinkering, the company is now going ahead with similar changes to its News Feed globally. These changes will likely de-prioritize stories from professional publishers, and instead favor dispatches published by a user’s friends and family. Many American news organizations will see the sharp traffic declines their brethren in other nations experienced last year—unless they pay Facebook to include their stories in readers’ feeds.","At the heart of this change is Facebook’s attempt to be seen not as a news publisher, but as a neutral platform for interactions between friends. Facing sharp criticism for its role in spreading misinformation, and possibly in tipping elections in the United States and in the United Kingdom, Facebook is anxious to limit its exposure by limiting its role. It has long been this way.","This rebalancing means different things for the company’s many stakeholders—for publishers, it means they’re almost certainly going to be punished for their reliance on a platform that’s never been a wholly reliable partner. Facebook didn’t talk to publishers in Slovakia because publishers are less important than other stakeholders in this next incarnation of Facebook. But more broadly, Facebook doesn’t talk to you because Facebook already knows what you want.","Facebook collects information on a person’s every interaction with the site—and many other actions online—so Facebook knows a great deal about what we pay attention to. People say they’re interested in a broad range of news from different political preferences, but Facebook knows they really want angry, outraged articles that confirm political prejudices.","Publishers in Slovakia and in the United States may warn of damage to democracy if Facebook readers receive less news, but Facebook knows people will be perfectly happy—perfectly engaged—with more posts from friends and families instead.","Tristan Harris, a fierce and persuasive critic of the ad-supported internet, recently offered me an analogy to explain a problem with revealed preferences. I pledge to go to the gym more in 2018, but every morning when I wake up, my partner presents me with a plate of donuts and urges me to stay in bed and eat them. My revealed preferences show that I’m more interested in eating donuts than in exercising. But it’s pretty perverse that my partner is working to give me what I really crave, ignoring what I’ve clearly stated I aspire to.","Facebook’s upcoming newsfeed change won’t eliminate fake news ... at least, it didn’t in Slovakia. People share sensational or shocking news, while more reliable news tends not to go viral. When people choose to subscribe to reliable news sources, they’re asking to go to the gym. With these News Feed changes, Facebook threw out your gym shoes and subscribed you to a donut-delivery service. Why do 2 billion people put up with a service that patronizingly reminds them that it’s designed for their well-being, while it studiously ignores our stated preferences? Many people feel like they don’t have a choice. Facebook is the only social network, for example, where I overlap with some of my friends, especially those from my childhood and from high school.","I don’t want Facebook to go away—I want it to get better. But increasingly, I think the only way Facebook will listen to people’s expressed preferences is if people start building better alternatives. Right now, Facebook chooses what stories should top your News Feed, optimizing for “engagement” and “time well spent.” Don’t like the choices Facebook is making? Too bad. You can temporarily set Facebook to give you a chronological feed, but when you close your browser window, you’ll be returned to Facebook’s paternalistic algorithm.","This fall, my colleagues and I released gobo.social, a customizable news aggregator. Gobo presents you with posts from your friends, but also gives you a set of sliders that govern what news you see and what’s hidden from you. Want more serious news, less humor? Move a slider. Need to hear more female voices? Adjust the gender slider, or press the “mute all men” button for a much quieter internet. Gobo currently includes half a dozen ways to tune your news feed, with more to come. (It’s open-source software, so you can write your own filters, too.) Gobo is a provocation, not a product. While it’s a good tool for reading Twitter, Facebook only allows us to show you Facebook Pages (the pages that are being de-prioritized in the News Feed changes), not posts from your friends, crippling its functionality as a social-network aggregator. Our goal is not to persuade you to read your social media through Gobo (though you’re certainly welcome to try!), but to encourage platforms like Facebook to give their users more control over what they see.","If you want to use Facebook to follow the news, you should be able to, even if Facebook’s algorithms know what really captures your attention. There’s a robust debate about how Facebook should present news to its readers. Should it filter out fake news? Prioritize high-quality news? Focus on friends and family instead of politics? Facebook’s decision to steer away from news is an attempt to evade this challenging debate altogether. And perhaps we were wrong to invite Facebook to this debate in the first place.","Instead of telling Facebook what it should do, people should build tools that let them view the world the way they choose. If regulators force Facebook and other platforms to police news quality, they’ll give more control to a platform that’s already demonstrated its disinterest in editorial judgment. A better path would be to force all platforms to adopt two simple rules:","Users own their own data, including the content they create and the web of relationships they’ve built online. And they can take this data with them from one platform to another, or delete it from an existing platform.","Users can view platforms like Facebook through an aggregator, a tool that lets you read social media through your own filters, like Gobo.","The first rule helps solve the problem that Facebook alternatives like Diaspora and Mastodon have faced. People have a great deal of time and emotional energy invested in their online communities. Asking them to throw these connections out and move to another network is a nonstarter. If we can move our data between platforms, there’s the possibility that some of Facebook’s 2 billion users will choose a social network where they have more control over what they read and write. The second rule allows developers to build real customizable aggregators, not toys like Gobo, which would let people control what they read on online platforms—helping them live up to their aspirations, not down to their preferences.","Obviously, Facebook is filled with people who care deeply about these issues. Some are my friends and my former students. But Facebook suffers from a problem of its own success. It has grown so central to our mediated understanding of the world that it either needs to learn to listen to its users’ stated desires, or it needs to make room for platforms that do.","We want to hear what you think about this article.

The USA and the UK have seen strong growth in Facebook user numbers in recent weeks, despite being home to the greatest number of people claiming that they’ll #DeleteFacebook.","Active Facebook users in both countries have grown by more than four percent since January this year (i.e. in the past 90 days), while the number of people using Facebook in India has jumped by 12 percent in just three months, despite Twitter users in the country posting more than 30,000 tweets containing the #DeleteFacebook hashtag.MAU numbers don’t tell us what people are actually doing on Facebook though, and some of these active users may have logged in to their Facebook account simply to adjust their privacy settings.","Also, despite the healthy growth in Facebook’s MAU numbers, it’s worth noting that trends in the data that I collect as part of my ongoing series of digital studies show that people are using Facebook less frequently than they used to, and the amount of time that people spend on the platform during the average visit is also decreasing. This is part of an ongoing change though, and isn’t solely attributable to the Cambridge Analytica affair.","What’s more, using Facebook less is very different to stopping using the platform — let alone deleting it.","This MAU data is published by Facebook though… could it be that someone has ‘polished’ these numbers?","Other data from reputable third parties suggests not.","Users rattled, but still mostly appy","The latest data from App Annie suggest that there was a significant drop in Facebook app downloads last week, but that this trend has already reversed, and download behavior in both the US and UK already seems to have returned to levels similar to those we saw prior to the latest wave of Cambridge Analytica stories.","Android users seem to have been more unsettled than iOS users though, with the Facebook app dropping 27 places to 36th spot in the overall US Google Play rankings between March 6 and March 21.","For reference, Android accounts for about 45 percent of all handsets in use in the US, according to the latest data from StatCounter.However, by March 25, the Facebook app had bounced back to 5th place in the US Google Play rankings – even higher than it ranked before the media circus of recent days.","The swings in Facebook app downloads in the UK were even more dramatic, with App Annie reporting that Facebook lost 46 places in the overall UK Google Play rankings between March 9 and March 22, from 12th to 58th place.","However — just as we saw in the USA — UK download figures bounced back over the weekend, and the app was back to 15th place in the overall UK Google Play rankings by Saturday (March 24).","Again for reference, Android accounts for roughly 46 percent of mobile handsets in use in the UK today.Given the widespread concerns surrounding the Cambridge Analytica affair, it’s perhaps unsurprising that Facebook experienced these significant drops in app downloads.","But did people go so far as to actually delete the Facebook app from their phone?","The simple answer: no. Far from it.","#UseFacebook","The latest data from SimilarWeb’s ‘App Usage’ rankings suggests that — over the past 30 days — Facebook’s app has been the most used mobile app in any category in both the USA and the UK.","None of the data suggest that Facebook Messenger has been impacted by recent controversies, either.","So, if you didn’t #DeleteFacebook, don’t worry — you’re not alone.","The simple reality is that Facebook is now an integral part of everyday life for more than two billion people around the world. We may be worried about the implications of the Cambridge Analytica story — and what it means more broadly for our data privacy — but it’s unlikely that Facebook will lose a meaningful number of users because of this episode.","So, if you’re going to keep using Facebook, what can you do to keep your data safe?","Data portability","Facebook is designed for sharing, whether that’s you posting photos of your lunch, or Facebook sharing targeting data with advertisers and behavioral data with app developers.","Most of this data sharing is integral to the core Facebook experience, but there are a few aspects of Facebook’s sharing functionality that may surprise even the most cautious of users.","In particular, in order to allow users to play social games and communicate with each other across third-party apps and services, Facebook makes certain aspects of our personal data available to developers when our friends use apps, games, or websites.","The principle behind this functionality has clear social benefits, but it’s the sheer volume of data that Facebook makes available that may surprise you.","Details of which data elements Facebook makes available to third-party developers are tucked away inside the settings menu, in a sub-menu called ‘Apps others use.’ It’s interesting to note that this menu doesn’t feature in the current version of Facebook’s ‘data privacy review’ walk-through.","The image below shows which elements of your Facebook data the platform shares with these third-party developers — note that everything with a check mark (‘✓’) is on by default for all users.","In other words, unless you’ve specifically changed these options, Facebook makes all of this data about you available to the developers of apps, games, and websites that your Facebook friends use, even if you don’t use those services yourself.Functionality like this enabled the developers of the psychology app embroiled in the Cambridge Analytica affair to access their users’ friends’ data, so you may want to review these settings on your own account now.","Fortunately, just a few tweaks should significantly reduce the amount of your data that Facebook shares with third-party apps, games, and services, so there shouldn’t be any need for you to #DeleteFacebook anytime soon.","The tweaking process can be a bit complex though, so my team and I produced the following video guide to help:","This post is part of our contributor series.

Pressed by the committee chairman at the Commons liaison committee later in the day, the prime minister said “Mr Zuckerberg will decide for himself” whether to give evidence to parliament.","She said the Cambridge Analytica affair “raises very deep concern in terms of what is suggested” and repeatedly said it was for Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and any individuals involved to “cooperate fully” with the information commissioner.","The company’s head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, said in a letter to Collins: “Facebook fully recognises the level of public and parliamentary interest in these issues and support your belief that these issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position to answer your questions. As such, Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available.”","Both men, Stimson wrote, “report directly to Mr Zuckerberg and are among the longest-serving senior representatives in Facebook’s 15-year history. Both of them have extensive expertise in these issues and are well placed to answer the committee’s questions on these complex subjects.”","During Tuesday’s committee hearing, Wylie suggested Facebook may have been aware of the large-scale harvesting of data carried out by Cambridge Analytica’s partner GSR even earlier than had been previously reported.","“I remember, and I think this was in around July 2014, [Aleksandr Kogan, GSR’s founder] was delayed for a couple of days because Facebook had throttled the app so that it couldn’t pull as much data, or there was some problem with pulling the data at the same speed as before.","“He told me he had had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook. So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers, or at least that’s what he told me.”","It took until 2015 for Facebook to take action on the data-harvesting project, after a Guardian article detailing GSR’s data abuse in support of the Ted Cruz campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.","And it was not until last week, after Facebook had again been notified by the Observer about the harvesting, that the company released a statement noting that “the entire company is outraged that we were deceived”.","Wylie also claimed that Palantir, a national security contractor owned by the Facebook board member Peter Thiel, was allowed informal access to the Facebook data harvested by GSR.","“We actually had several meetings with Palantir,” Wylie said. “There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data. That was not an official contract between Palantir and CA, but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data. And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.”","Despite the confidentiality agreements he entered into with Cambridge Analytica, Wylie described Facebook’s attempts to kill last week’s story as being the most forceful.","“The most amount of legal pushback that I’ve got actually wasn’t from Cambridge Analytica, it was from Facebook. It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he said.","“They sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t taken action on that. I think, I’m not sure exactly what they’re planning to do. They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me any more.”","Testifying alongside Wylie was Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of personaldata.io, who has been fighting to force the social network to apply European data protection law. Dehaye revealed that Facebook repeatedly tried to argue it was exempt from fulfilling “subject access” requirements, which allow individuals to see the data that companies hold about them, because it would be too expensive to comply.","“They’re invoking exceptions … involving disproportionate effort,” Dehaye said. “They’re saying it’s too much effort to give me access to my data. I find that quite intriguing, because they’re making a technical and a business argument as to why I shouldn’t have access to this data.","“In the technical argument they’re shooting themselves in the foot, because they’re saying they’re so big the cost would be too large to provide me data.”","In effect, Dehaye said, Facebook told him it was too big to regulate. “They’re really arguing that they’re too big to comply with data protection law, the cost is too high, which is mind-boggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make this argument?”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

What state should you move to be based on your personality? What character on “Downton Abbey” would you be? What breed of dog is best for you? Some enormous percentage of Facebook’s 2.13 billion users must have seen Facebook friends sharing results of various online quizzes. They are sometimes annoying, senseless and a total waste of time. But they are irresistible. Besides, you’re only sharing the results with your family and friends. There’s nothing more innocent, right?","Facebook is in the business of exploiting your data. The company is worth billions of dollars because it harvests your data and sells it to advertisers. Users are encouraged to like, share and comment their lives away in the name of staying connected to family and friends. However, as an ethical hacker, security researcher and data analyst, I know that there is a lot more to the story. The bedrock of modern democracy is at stake.","You are being psychographically profiled","Most people have heard of demographics – the term used by advertisers to slice up a market by age, gender, ethnicity and other variables to help them understand customers. In contrast, psychographics measure people’s personality, values, opinions, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. They help advertisers understand the way you act and who you are.","Historically, psychographic data were much harder to collect and act on than demographics. Today, Facebook is the world’s largest treasure trove of this data. Every day billions of people give the company huge amounts of information about their lives and dreams. This isn’t a problem when the data are used ethically – like when a company shows you an ad for a pair of sunglasses you recently searched for.","However, it matters a lot when the data are used maliciously – segmenting society into disconnected echo chambers, and custom-crafting misleading messages to manipulate individuals’ opinions and actions. That’s exactly what Facebook allowed to happen.","Quizzes, reading your mind and predicting your politics","Recent reports have revealed how Cambridge Analytica, a UK-based company owned by an enigmatic billionaire and led at the time by candidate Donald Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon, used psychographic data from Facebook to profile American voters in the months before the 2016 presidential election. Why? To target them with personalized political messages and influence their voting behavior. A whistleblower from Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie, described in detail how the company exploited Facebook users by harvesting their data and building models to “target their inner demons.”","The company does more than just sell your data. Since the early 2000s, Facebook has provided access to academic researchers seeking to study you. Many psychologists and social scientists have made their careers analyzing ways to predict your personality and ideologies by asking simple questions. These questions, like the ones used in social media quizzes, do not appear to have obvious connections to politics. Even a decision like which web browser you are using to read this article is filled with clues about your personality.","In 2015, Facebook gave permission to academic researcher Aleksandr Kogan to develop a quiz of his own. Like other quizzes, his was able to capture all of your public information, including name, profile picture, age, gender and birthday; everything you’ve ever posted on your timeline; your entire friends list; all of your photos and the photos you’re tagged in; education history; hometown and current city; everything you’ve ever liked; and information about the device you’re using including your web browser and preferred language.","Kogan shared the data he collected with Cambridge Analytica, which was against Facebook policy – but apparently the company rarely enforced its rules.","Going shopping for impressionable users","Analyzing these data, Cambridge Analytica determined topics that would intrigue users, what kind of political messaging users were susceptible to, how to frame the messages, the content and tone that would motivate users, and how to get them to share it with others. It compiled a shopping list of traits that could be predicted about voters.","Then the company was able to create websites, ads and blogs that would attract Facebook users and encourage them to spread the word. In Wylie’s words: “they see it … they click it … they go down the rabbit hole.”","This is how American voters were targeted with fake news, misleading information and contradictory messages intended to influence how they voted – or if they voted at all.","This is how Facebook users’ relationships with family and friends are being exploited for monetary profit, and for political gain.","Knowingly putting users at risk","Facebook could have done more to protect users.","The company encouraged developers to build apps for its platform. In return, the apps had access to vast amounts of user data – supposedly subject to those rules that were rarely enforced. But Facebook collected 30 percent of payments made through the apps, so its business interest made it want more apps, doing more things. People who didn’t fill out quizzes were vulnerable, too. Facebook allowed companies like Cambridge Analytica to collect personal data of friends of quiz takers, without their knowledge or consent. Tens of millions of people’s data were harvested – and many more Facebook users could have been affected by other apps.","Changing culture and politics","In a video interview with the Observer, Wylie explained that “Politics flows from culture you have to change the people in order to change culture.”","That’s exactly what Facebook enabled Cambridge Analytica to do. In 2017, the company’s CEO boasted publicly that it was “able to use data to identify very large quantities of persuadable voters that could be influenced to vote for the Trump campaign.”","To exert that influence, Cambridge Analytica – which claims to have 5,000 data points on every American – used people’s data to psychologically nudge them to alter their behaviors in predictable ways.","This included what became known as “fake news.” In an undercover investigation, Britain’s Channel 4 recorded Cambridge Analytica executives expressing their willingness to disseminate misinformation, with its CEO saying, “these are things that don’t necessarily need to be true, as long as they’re believed.” (The Conversation)","US society was unprepared: 62 percent of American adults get news on social media, and many people who see fake news stories report that they believe them. So Cambridge Analytica’s tactics worked: 115 pro-Trump fake stories were shared on Facebook a total of 30 million times. In fact, the most popular fake news stories were more widely shared on Facebook than the most popular mainstream news stories.","For this psychological warfare, the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica millions of dollars.","A healthy dose of skepticism","US history is filled with stories of people sharing their thoughts in the public square. If interested, a passerby could come and listen, sharing in the experience of the narrative.","By combining psychographic profiling, analysis of big data and ad micro-targeting, public discourse in the US has entered a new era. What used to be a public exchange of information and democratic dialogue is now a customized whisper campaign: Groups both ethical and malicious can divide Americans, whispering into the ear of each and every user, nudging them based on their fears and encouraging them to whisper to others who share those fears.","A Cambridge Analytica executive explained: “There are two fundamental human drivers hopes and fears and many of those are unspoken and even unconscious. You didn’t know that was a fear until you saw something that evoked that reaction from you. Our job is to understand those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it’s all about emotion.”","The information that you shared on Facebook exposed your hopes and fears. That innocent-looking Facebook quiz isn’t so innocent.","The problem isn’t that this psychographic data were exploited at a massive scale. It’s that platforms like Facebook enable people’s data to be used in ways that take power away from voters and give it to data-analyzing campaigners.","In my view, this kills democracy. Even Facebook can see that, saying in January that at its worst, social media “allows people to spread misinformation and corrode democracy.”","You may like","Kenya’s new pesticides tax could fuel trade in fakes","A decision by Kenya to introduce value added tax on pesticides has sparked concerns of a potential influx of illegal imports and counterfeits in East Africa.","The 16 per cent VAT on crop protection products became effective on July 1. In Tanzania and Uganda, the products remain zero-rated.","Agrochemical companies now fear farmers will no longer afford genuine products, leading to an influx of counterfeits.","It is estimated that Kenya losses $50 million annually in revenue to unregistered agrochemicals dealers and counterfeit pesticides. Industry insiders say 18 per cent of pest control products in the country are counterfeits.","In Tanzania and Uganda the figure rises to 40 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.","“With the taxation, illegal imports from the region will increase thereby harming the local industries,” said the Agrochemical Association of Kenya’s chief executive Evelyn Lusenaka.","Ms Lusenaka said that the VAT will also increase the cost of agricultural production, and eventually impact on food security — one of four pillars in the Jubilee government’s Big Four Agenda. The others are manufacturing, universal healthcare and affordable housing.","It is estimated that pests and diseases account for 40 per cent of crop losses, and in some cases can cause 100 per cent loss, particularly with the emergence of pests like the fall armyworm.","In response, the region has witnessed a steady increase in the use of pesticides with Kenya importing about 14,700 tonnes at a cost of $124 million last year.","This is a 9.6 per cent increase from the 14,600 tonnes imported in 2016 at a cost of $112.3 million.","In Tanzania and Uganda, imports stood at 11,000 tonnes and 9,000 tonnes respectively last year.","While the increase in pesticides use saved farmers from crop losses, it has also resulted in a surge in counterfeits and illegal imports.","“Favourable taxation has helped to keep pesticides affordable thereby ensuring improved yields due to reduced losses associated with pests and diseases. Now these gains will be eroded,” said Ms Lusenaka.","Telecommunication companies woke up to the news of an increase in the cost of money transfer services.","This comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta proposed an increment in tax from 12 percent to 20 percent in mobile transfer platforms for Safaricom, Telkom, Airtel, money transfer agencies, banks and other financial institutions.","The fee charged will be more than excisable value owing to the fact that there have been a growing number of consumers using the mobile money transfer in the recent past. The move is aimed at raising further Sh25.7 billion on tax revenue for 2018/19 financial year.","As the President seeks to seal the loopholes of low revenues raised by the country, the ordinary Kenyan will have to foot for the bill that has been alleged to emanate from heightened levels of corruption.","Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich slapped Telco’s with a two percent increase of mobile money transfers which saw the companies such as Safaricom raise the transaction cost of deposits and withdrawals.","This latest government move in raising taxes is going to largely affect the poor who depend on the system.","Money transfers in the country have been on the rise over the past two years with Safaricom’s M-Pesa enjoying massive subscriptions to its system.","Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service.

The overflow of indulging in inspirational works of prolific writers such a Rick Warren and Myles Monroe led him to release his first book at the age of 25; Poor by Choice.","Earlier on in 2018, he released his second book called Wisdom for the Wise which is also a motivational book. The Moi University graduate has a great passion for community work and is involved in many community programmes in the non-profit sector.","A born again believer, Timothy also spares some time for ministry and finds joy in winning souls for Christ.","What are the three most memorable books from your childhood? I began reading seriously in my teens, from around 16 years, hence the books that wowed me in my younger days are The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren, An Enemy Called Average by John Mason and The Assignment by Mike Murdock. They opened my eyes to the power of motivational books. I kept reading and eventually started writing my own inspirational books.","How many books on average do you read in a year?(laughs) Do I really count them…let’s see…last year I read about 16 books.","What are the three books that failed to meet your expectation?","To be quite honest, most of the books I have read lived up to their hype. However, sometimes I purchase a book based on the blurb and sadly, the content inside doesn’t measure up to the summary. The Cross and the Switchblade by David Wilkerson, The Man in The Brown Suit by Agatha Christie and A Man of the People by Chinua Achebe didn’t quite meet my expectation.","Which are your two most treasured books and why? Would you lend them out?","(laughs) I am a young author, I treasure my two books Poor by Choice and Wisdom for the Wise, most. Of course I wouldn’t mind lending them out but it would be awesome to purchase a copy from me.","If you had the opportunity to meet three authors (dead or alive) who would they be and why?","Dr Myles Monroe, Chinua Achebe and Rick Warren. Anyone who knows me well will tell you that I love Dr Myles Monroe. He mentored me into the world of inspirational writing and self-publishing. His impact on my life was tremendous and though he passed on, his teachings inspire me to date. If I met him, I would tell him as much. I like how Chinua Achebe uses language; his style of writing is quite captivating and I would commend him for that. Rick Warren writes inspirational books in such a simple and engaging manner, it would be great to have a chat about that with him.","In your opinion, is writer’s block an actual challenge faced by writers or an excuse for procrastination?","It’s a washed out excuse for procrastination. I believe that a good writer doesn’t need to wait for the perfect time, place, idea, topic or content to write. He or she simply grabs the idea and runs with it…along the way it becomes perfect. Or comes close at least.","Have you ever had a bad review for your work? What did it say and how did you deal with it?","No. What I have had is constructive criticism especially after releasing my first book. I call it constructive because after applying the lessons drawn from it, my writing improved significantly. I am open to that kind of criticism."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

The initial wave of this scandal began last week when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy, had acquired information on more than 50 million Facebook users via an app that accessed that information through the Facebook platform several years ago.","Last week, Zuckerberg said in one of several interviews that, “if it ever the case that I am the most informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify, I will happily do that.” Clearly, it appears that Congress wants the chief executive officer of the formerly-$500 billion advertising-driven business to be the one to do the explaining amid the increased fallout over the Cambridge Analytica debacle.","While Facebook is not unfamiliar with privacy snafus, this appeared to be one of the final straws, forcing Facebook CEO to issue a sort of non-apology-ish apology — as well as take out full page (in wildly not-very-engaging full text form, weirdly enough) ads in several major newspapers. Zuckerberg in particular has been a face absent in front of Congress, but it appears the pressure from this incident may be too much for the company to handle without getting his face out there in order to neutralize the fallout.","Facebook offered CTO Mike Schroepfer and chief product officer Chris Cox to meet with the UK committee this morning, but Zuckerberg again was absent there. Indeed, it was several days following the Cambridge Analytica reports that Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg made a formal statement in the form of Facebook posts, as well as a number of interviews with various media outlets to try to explain themselves out of the situation.","We reached out to Facebook for a comment and will update the post when we hear back."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of U.S. voters and influence their behaviour. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica's drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: \"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\"","\"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" he added. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\"","The Guardian reported Sunday that at 17, Wylie worked in the office of the leader of the opposition, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion.","A senior source with the Liberal party says Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission.","Details of Cambridge's acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm's psychographic modelling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but also still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","\"This was a scam — and a fraud,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,\" Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook's rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was \"illegally acquired and used.\"","In the United States, Mercer's daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company's role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mueller's interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm's British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users' identities, friend networks and \"likes.\" Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","\"Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do,\" Grewal said. \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"","Still, he added, \"it's a serious abuse of our rules.\"","Reading voters' minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Nix, a brash salesperson, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defence contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Barack Obama's campaigns. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters' behaviour and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting bought Nix into contact with Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser; and with Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America's culture and rewire its politics, recalled Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia's gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fundraiser. Although Cuccinelli lost, Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Nix was eager to win.","When Wylie's colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Neugebauer, Nix castigated them over email.","\"ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\" he wrote.","Wylie's team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behaviour.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\"","He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","An international effort","Just as Kogan's efforts were getting underway, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL's elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a licence to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie's team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European.","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the U.S. midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \"personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\" Nix \"never had any strategic or operational role\" in a U.S. election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company's U.S. ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees' roles in each campaign and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","After the leak","By early 2015, Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favoured.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Wylie and other former \"contractors\" as engaging in \"what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\"","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was \"carefully investigating this situation\" and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \"This data was obtained and used without permission,\" said a letter that was obtained by The New York Times. \"It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\"","Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Kogan and \"SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\"","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook's control. The New York Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The New York Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica's political business. No U.S. campaigns or super PACs have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 mid-terms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Trump's re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a \"Math Man,\" he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev but has not signed them on.","Cambridge Analytica used personality quiz app to harvest social media data from over 50 million users, most without consent.","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 U.S. midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K.

Thom Tillis, R-N.C.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \"personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\" Nix \"never had any strategic or operational role\" in a U.S. election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company's U.S. ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees' roles in each campaign and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","After the leak","By early 2015, Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favoured.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Wylie and other former \"contractors\" as engaging in \"what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\"","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was \"carefully investigating this situation\" and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \"This data was obtained and used without permission,\" said a letter that was obtained by The New York Times. \"It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\"","Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Kogan and \"SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\"","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook's control. The New York Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The New York Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica's political business. No U.S. campaigns or super PACs have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 mid-terms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Trump's re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a \"Math Man,\" he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev but has not signed them on.","Cambridge Analytica used personality quiz app to harvest social media data from over 50 million users, most without consent.","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 U.S. midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of U.S. voters and influence their behaviour. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica's drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: \"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\"","\"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" he added. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\"","The Guardian reported Sunday that at 17, Wylie worked in the office of the leader of the opposition, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion.","A senior source with the Liberal party says Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission.","Details of Cambridge's acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm's psychographic modelling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but also still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","\"This was a scam — and a fraud,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,\" Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook's rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was \"illegally acquired and used.\"","In the United States, Mercer's daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company's role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mueller's interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm's British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users' identities, friend networks and \"likes.\" Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","\"Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do,\" Grewal said. \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"","Still, he added, \"it's a serious abuse of our rules.\"","Reading voters' minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Nix, a brash salesperson, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defence contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Barack Obama's campaigns. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters' behaviour and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting bought Nix into contact with Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser; and with Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America's culture and rewire its politics, recalled Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia's gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fundraiser. Although Cuccinelli lost, Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Nix was eager to win.","When Wylie's colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Neugebauer, Nix castigated them over email.","\"ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\" he wrote.","Wylie's team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behaviour.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\"","He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","An international effort","Just as Kogan's efforts were getting underway, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL's elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a licence to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie's team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European.","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the U.S. midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Sen.

When you post a picture of your kids at a family gathering, which one of your Facebook friends can share it? What private information are those Facebook game apps collecting on you for \"third-party uses\"? How do you make sure that live video stream is seen only by people you choose? Every action you take on Facebook has privacy and sharing implications that need to be considered before you upload that next selfie.","Fortunately, thanks to vocal demands for transparency from both Facebook users and government regulators around the world, Facebook has been making the process of managing your privacy easier. Below is our step-by-step guide to taking full control of your Facebook privacy settings.","The basic privacy options","If you’re not ready to dive into Facebook’s substantial settings menu, there’s a more user-friendly guide through the more vital privacy settings. Click on the question mark symbol in the top right of any Facebook page when you’re logged in, and select Privacy Check-up, an easy-to-follow walkthrough of your current settings as they pertain to \"Posts\", \"Apps\" and \"Profile\".","(Alternately, for an even quicker speed-tuneup, you can adjust who can see your posts, send you friend requests, or block users by hitting the question mark symbol and selecting Privacy shortcuts.)","Posts","Starting with Posts, you can check your default sharing setting. We recommend the Friends setting over the Public one. When set to Public all your posts can be seen by anyone on or off Facebook. Unless you're a celebrity or running a page that is used to generate interest in a business you run, you will likely want to keep your activity restricted to those you have Friended.","The Friend setting has a few tweaks you should be aware of as well. By clicking on the sharing setting button, then the More Options button, you will see the Custom option. Click on that and you will see that you can include all your Friends while excluding the names of certain Facebook friends you don't want to see your updates. It is also important to note that the Friends of anyone tagged in your post or photos will be able to see that post unless you uncheck the option in this window.","If you have joined any Facebook groups or made lists of Facebook friends, you can restrict the posts that way or hide your posts from those groups and lists as well. Want just your college friends to see your late night party pictures? Want to make sure your work friends don't see your selfie at the beach when you called in sick? This is where these restrictions could come in handy both on a per post basis or as an overall option.","Finally, remember that you can change the sharing settings of any individual Facebook update by clicking on the sharing button to the left of the Post button. You can even go back to change settings of previous posts by clicking on the people icon at the top of the post, to the right of the date stamp.","Apps","Remember the Candy Crush Facebook game you played too much last year? How about that Instagram Facebook app you forgot you installed? Each app on the site you agreed to install has permission to post to your Friends list unless you told it otherwise at the time you installed it. Can't remember? This part of the tool shows you each app attached to your account and what sharing permissions it has. These settings also control who can see that you have the app installed.","If you don't use the app anymore, just delete it by clicking on the x. While checking my own app list while writing this guide, I found many apps I no longer use that had sharing rights on my account. I deleted all that I'm not actively using and set the sharing permissions of the remaining ones to Only Me.","Profile","Here you can see the privacy setting on your email addresses, birthday, hometown, relationship status and other personal details about your life. Under emails it will show the one you registered with when you first signed up for Facebook as well as one Facebook has assigned to you (which you likely will never use). I discovered that I left my Gmail account public, which I hadn't meant to.","For your birthday, the sharing settings are split between the day/month and the year. That way your Friends can wish you happy birthday on Facebook on your special day without necessarily knowing your exact age.","For hometown, this setting only affects what your Friends can see. Advertisers and others may still access this information, especially if you are using the Facebook app which tracks your location automatically.","Finally, if you have set a relationship with another Facebook user, it will be shared unless you set otherwise.","It's important to note that this is only a partial list of the information you're sharing. To see the full list, click the My About Page button, which will take you to your profile page. On there, you can review the various sections—Work and Education, Places You've Lived, Contact and Basic Info, Family and Relationships, Details About You, and Life Events —and make changes hovering over each and clicking the link that appears.","The advanced privacy options","Here you can exert more control of what is being shared with whom. Which is never a bad idea. You've likely gone through this at least once in the past, but it's a great idea to review your settings at least once a year.","To get to the advanced privacy settings, click the drop down arrow in the top right on any Facebook page, click \"Settings,\" and then \"Privacy\" in the left navigation column.","Who can see my stuff?","Who can see your future posts? This is the same as the Your Posts section above.","Review all your posts and things you're tagged in Ever been tagged in an embarrassing photo uploaded by that distant college classmate? You can use the Activity Log page and select the Posts You're Tagged In (in the left column) and the Photos > Photos of You (also in the left column) to check out what you've been tagged in. You can then remove the tag (click the dropdown arrow on the left of the post or photo and then click on the the Remove Tag button at the top of the page) or simply click Hide so they don’t appear on your Timeline.","Review your other activity on Facebook. Hitting “More” after Photos, Likes and Comments reveals other items that may have been automatically posted to your Timeline and your friends’ news feeds, including friends made, events attended, and videos watched (these are embedded video posts that are separate from video apps, and isn’t controlled from the Apps menu above).","Some of these, such as friends made, can only be tweaked to be allowed or hidden on your Timeline. For “videos watched”, you can hover over the padlock to view who can see that you’ve watched it, or choose to delete the post. You can also Clear Video Watch History at the top of the page, and manually update privacy settings by individual posts from music, news and games apps. Click on each section to make sure that the audiences for every category of activity is ok with you.","Limit the audience for your old posts for your Timeline This will revert all your previous posts from \"Public\" or \"Friends of Friends\" to just \"Friends\". But if you've tagged a Friend in one of your posts, their Friends can see that since that is the default setting when tagging someone.","Facebook Live – private, friends or public? For live video stream posts from your smartphone, the default setting for each video stream will be the privacy level you set for regular posts and photos.","You may want to be a little less selective for live-stream video if you’re shooting something news-worthy (or if your plan is to go viral), or more selective when you’re just testing something out.","Either way, fire up the usual status update and select Live Video or the little red person icon. If it’s your first time, you’ll also want to grant Facebook permission to access your camera and microphone. You’ll see your name and profile pic and underneath, the permission level for the video. Tap to edit and select an audience from options of Friends, friends minus a couple no-no’s for reasons of your own, or public to be viewable by anyone on or off Facebook.","If you run a Facebook Page and have professional video software or hardware (more informationhere) you can also stream from your computer, but as you’re assumed to want to reach your usual audience, there’s no option to tweak post visibility separate to your regular posts.","Who can contact me?","Who can send you friend requests? The default is Everybody, but the only other choice is Friends of Friends.","Who can look me up?","Who can you look you up with the email address you provided? If someone types in the email address you registered with, they can send you a message which will likely land in the Other tab on the Messages page. You can restrict it to Friends of Friends or just Friends (who can message you anyway), if you don't want to be bothered.","Who can look you up using the phone number you provided? Same as the email address.","Do you want other search engines to link to your timeline? Your first impulse may be to turn this off, but Facebook only allows information you've marked as Public to be shown to other search engines. They see it as a way for friends not on Facebook to find you. They do this with your basic information they always make public which is, according to Facebook, \"...your name, gender, username and user ID (account number), profile picture, cover photo and networks.\" Whatever you choose for all three of the above settings, anyone will still be able to find your profile simply by looking up your name in Facebook search.","Timeline and tagging options","Now that you've mastered the basics, go down to the next section, Timeline and Tagging. From there, you can control exactly who sees what on your timeline, who can post to your timeline, and who can tag you in photos and posts.","To customize your timeline settings, click on the down arrow in the far upper right corner to reveal a drop-down menu and select Settings.","Who can add things to my timeline?","Who can post on your timeline? It's set by default to Friends and the only other option is to allow only yourself to post on your timeline.","Review posts friends tag you in before they appear on your timeline? If you are concerned about getting tagged in a photo that you don't want all your friends on Facebook to see, this is the setting for you. Once enabled, you'll have to manually approve any photo or posts you are tagged in before they appear on your timeline. Note that this only affects your timeline; those updates will still appear in searches, the news feed and other places unless you un-tag yourself. (Alternately, you can extricate yourself from incriminating posts by clicking on the offending post, then the arrow in the top right to “Remove Tag”.)","Who can see things on my Timeline?","Review what other people see on your Timeline. Click “View As” for the perfect way to check that your mother or boss won't see what you don't want them to.","Who can see posts you've been tagged in on your Timeline? These areas give you a great deal of flexibility, with options ranging from Everyone to Friends of Friends to custom lists. Using this and the below setting in conjunction with manually approving what photos and updates you've been tagged in goes a long way to keep prying eyes away from more sensitive Facebook updates.","Who can see what others post on your timeline? As above, you have flexibility with options ranging from Everyone to Friends of Friends to custom lists. Using this in conjunction with manually approving what photos and updates you've been tagged in goes a long way to keep prying eyes away from more sensitive Facebook updates.","How can I manage tags people add and tagging suggestions?","Review tags people add to your own posts before the tags appear on Facebook? This is an important option if you are concerned about a photo appearing on your profile. This applies only to photo tagging by your Facebook friends. You'll always be notified if someone who's not your friend tags you in a photo.","When you're tagged in a post, who do you want to add to the audience if they aren't already in it? This one sounds more complicated than it is. Often a Facebook friend of yours will make a post and tag you in it. The option here allows all of your Facebook friends to see an update or photo you've been tagged in by someone they aren't friends with themselves (the Friends of Friends function). You can choose to remain tagged but have none of your other Facebook friends see that update, limit who sees that update to certain groups of friends, or you can outright block certain Facebook friends altogether by using the Custom option.","Who sees tag suggestions when photos that look like you are uploaded? Facebook uses face-matching technology to suggest who you should tag in photos. It will only suggest people that are on the user's friends list. If you don't want to show up as an option when your friends are tagging photos, set this to No One.","Manage blocking","If you want to take steps to keep people away from your profile, this is the section for you.","Restricted list","If you don't want to un-friend somebody but also don't want them to see all of your information, you can add them to the Restricted List. This means they can see your public information, but they have no way of knowing you’ve limited their view (unless they happen to see someone browsing your profile who isn't restricted).","Block users","You can also just straight up block somebody. This means this person cannot be your friend. This is an excellent setting if you have stalkers or other people consistently bothering you. Note that this does not stop them from interacting with you in apps, games or groups you're both a part of.","Block messages","Block messages If you’re receiving unwelcome messages and video calls from someone, you can put a stop to that here – and it carries over to the Messenger app too. However, the pest in question will still be able to post to your Timeline unless you block them as a user (above).","Block app invites","In addition to blocking and restricting people from your profile, you can also block app invitations on a user-by-user basis. So if your Aunt Jackie keeps bombarding you with FarmVille apps, you know what to do.","Block event invites","Tired of your nephew inviting you to his New York City raves every weekend? Typing the name of the Facebook user into this section will stop you from seeing any future event invites from that person.","Block apps","Some apps and Facebook games are great fun at first, but after a while, you want to drop them. You can remove the app or game (see the Apps you use section, below) or block the app, which means it can no longer contact you or get non-public information about you through Facebook. If you are getting emails from the app, you will have to use the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.","Block pages","Is that discount fashion site you liked bombarding you with updates from its Facebook Page? Block ‘em here, where you’ll also automatically unlike and unfollow the Page. You can also block other Pages (i.e., public pages for businesses and celebrities) from commenting on or liking your posts.","Customize app privacy","You handled a lot of this with the Privacy Checkup, but in the Settings section there are additional controls for the apps where you’ve logged in with Facebook.","App settings","Click on each app to view the information that it is collecting from your Facebook profile – your public profile, as well as things like your friends list, date of birth, pages you like, and more. Here you can tweak which of these pieces of data can be collected (except public profile, which is required by all apps). You can also remove the app entirely from the main screen by clicking the ‘X’, however, that doesn’t delete the information the app already has about you.","For future app logins with Facebook, it’s wise to set what info the app can collect – when signing up for the first time, click “Edit This” to choose which data you want to share.","Apps, websites and Platforms","Facebook Platform provides third parties access to personal data you share with Facebook. It's how Cambridge Analytica, the company was recently suspended by Facebook while under investigation for election interference, was able to access the data of more than 50 million users in 2014. Facebook Platform also enables third parties you engage with to collect information on your Facebook friends.","Disabling Facebook Platform means you’ll no longer be able to login to websites, mobile games or applications using Facebook or see app requests from friends, but you’ll still be able to use apps and play games on Facebook and elsewhere. If you choose to keep Facebook Platform enabled, you can limit your exposure by selecting the data that apps that your Facebook Friends use can access.","Apps others use","When your Facebook friends use certain apps, those apps access your public information and more. See the full list in the image to the right. There's quite a bit you may not be comfortable sharing without your knowledge. Most of it is enabled by default. Be sure to go through the list and check off what you don't want shared. Note that your public profile info, friend list and gender is not on this list - but these are shared with your friends’ apps (unless you turn off Platform, above).","Follower Settings","If you’re lucky enough to have people hanging off your every post, you can decide to widen your net of followers here. Friends follow by default, but you can change it to the only other option - let Everyone view your public posts (you can set public-ness each time you post).","Ads","targeted advertising.

You’ll still see advertising on Facebook, it just won’t be based on all those steam mops you were looking up.","Ads on apps and websites off of the Facebook Companies Since Facebook operates its own ad network of sites, it can also target you with ads even when you’re not browsing Facebook – essentially, at any site that uses its ad technology. But the permission is trickily worded – it asks if it can use your Facebook ad preferences, so choose Yes and make sure you review the section below entitled Ad Preferences. Even if you’ve always turned off targeted ads based on browsing (above), Facebook can use information on your profile, such as Likes, to create ad preferences.","Regardless, you’ll most likely still receive targeted ads outside Facebook that are based on your age, gender and location, as well as browsing activity on sites that are part of other ad networks. If you want to stop seeing-based ads in general, you can opt out at the Digital Advertising Alliance - though it notes that the opt-out can only apply to participating companies.","Ads with your social actions","If you like, comment on or share a Page (say, owned by a business or brand), Facebook can broadcast it as an advertisement to all your friends.","This also applies to apps used (for example, Spotify) and events joined (say, if you hit attend for a café’s Veggie Fridays).

After initially denying the claims, Facebook posted a statement acknowledging the breach and promising to take action.","I am not going to delve into politics here (which is what this data was ultimately used for micro-targeting and influencing the electorate). There is a lot more at stake here—subversion, ethics and privacy.","Let us do quick post-mortem here on the mechanics of this breach, the impact on what it means to a platform vendor and ultimately what you and I as consumers can and must do going forward","Mechanics: A third-party app on Facebook developed by a purported researcher allows it extensive access to more private information than otherwise permissible to regular 3rd party apps. And this access balloons beyond the people who actually used the app—reportedly 270,000—to hit a massive 50 million giving the app unfettered access to a treasure trove of sensitive information. This data is then handed over to another firm—Cambridge Analytica—for a “fee” and this firm uses this to do micro-targeting. Finally, Facebook banned this firm from its platform after learning that the firm did not completely delete the data after it discovered that it had all this sensitive information.","Platform vendors’ conundrum: As a platform vendor, the stakes to protect data have never been higher. Yet, the average breach size and impact keeps growing. Why? Let’s dig in. Facebook, on its part has to make its platform attractive to 3rd party developers and its richest asset is you and me—our data—and making this available to 3rd party apps means more developers building on its platform and more stickiness for its platform and more targeted ads implying higher revenue.","Seems pretty obvious isn’t it? The friction here is that they must have a much higher bar given how impactful such a breach can be and can actually sway minds and hearts to make or break election results. But this is not a Facebook issue. Every platform vendor has this same dilemma. The need to drive revenue and monetize their data against the need to protect the data. And we should also expect the typical reaction sequence that Facebook had when such a breach is exposed—Ignorance followed by Denial followed by Outrage.","Where does that leave the consumer: This is where GDPR comes in. The first human comprehensible set of actionable rights that is accorded to you and me. The most well-known of this is “the right to be forgotten.” You can request any large service provider in the world (who has any connection with the EU whatsoever which is everyone) to obliterate your data forever and they must oblige. Or you can request your data to be handed to you in a “portable” format that you can take with you.","Beyond GDPR there is more that the consumer needs to take control of. In the case of Facebook, this is limiting what 3rd party apps have access to. And this can be confusing with apps constantly “complaining” that they will not work properly without access to body sensors, contacts or the camera. And the user needs to ultimately start with a point of zero-trust—turn off all access—and then test for themselves how the app behaves and then gradually turn on permissions as needed.","Sound difficult? It is not in reality but hitting the easy button will have consequences of the “analytica” kind. And then we will act outraged when it happens.","We are in a journey where the privacy boundaries are going to be constantly tested. Expecting the platform vendors to suddenly start doing the “morally” right thing is too naïve. Consumers need to be savvier and assume extreme ownership of their own data. GDPR provides the framework, it is our duty to exercise it.","This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

According to Grewal, the social network became aware that Kogan had transferred highly granular data he had collected on 270,000 users in 2015.","The Facebook attorney did not mention that Kogan’s data also included information on tens of millions of users who were linked as “friends” of these users and that it had taken no steps to verify that Cambridge Analytica and another firm, Eunoia Technologies, had erased the improperly obtained data. Grewal stated that Facebook recently learned that both firms had not done so and that they would be suspended from using its services.","Facebook had already been facing increasing pressure from regulators in Europe and the United States for lax policies regarding political advertising and the ease with which purveyors of fabricated or grossly exaggerated news stories can utilize the platform. Some elected officials have been questioning whether the company can understand the amount of data that it collects in order to properly manage it. According to Facebook, its platform has over 2 billion monthly users and millions of advertisers looking to monetize them.","“I think you do enormous good. But your power sometimes scares me,” Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., admonished a Facebook attorney last October. “You don’t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you? Today, right now. Not your commitment, I’m asking about your ability.”","The unauthorized transfer and Facebook’s failure to follow-up may open it up to a bevy of consumer data privacy lawsuits in Europe, which has much stronger regulations on what academic and commercial entities may do with information they collect.","On Friday, David Carroll, an associate professor at the New York-based Parsons School of Design, filed a lawsuit in London against Cambridge Analytica for allegedly violating the United Kingdom’s privacy rules.","“I am concerned that I may have been targeted with messages that criticized Secretary Hillary Clinton with falsified or exaggerated information that negatively affected my sentiment about her candidacy and consequently discouraged me from engaging with the Clinton campaign as a formal or informal volunteer,” Carroll wrote in his plaintiff brief.","The professor filed his suit after he said that Cambridge had failed to give him the source of the information that it had aggregated about him, a violation of United Kingdom data usage laws which require that companies disclose such information when requested by consumers.","No such litigation in the United States has been filed against Facebook as of yet but on Saturday, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that she had opened an investigation into both Cambridge Analytica and the internet behemoth for their relationship.","Facebook is also being sued in a federal district court in San Francisco in a class action matter which alleges that the company had violated an Illinois law which prohibits the unauthorized use of photographs of a person without their permission. The company is being sued for employing software which stores information on Americans for use in labeling posted images in which they appear. Such software is highly restricted in Canada and the European Union but is mostly unregulated in the United States.","You can now support Salon from as little as $2, and help shape the future of Salon that you’d prefer.\nSalon’s pioneering, award-winning journalism that is read by people in over 230 countries has been mostly supported by advertising revenue over its 20+ year history.

Reports last week revealed that, thanks to several hundred thousand Facebook users voluntarily taking part in a supposed psychology test, the data of approximately 50m users was then extracted.","Access to that data was not, at the time, in contravention of Facebook’s own policies for developers. However, the researcher behind the psychological test, Dr. Aleksandr Spectre, subsequently provided his data set to political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. That organization used the data to build precise profiles of US voters, which were then used for targeted campaigns in the 2016 presidential election.","Facebook has insisted that, despite portrayals otherwise, this was not a data breach. Instead, the social network maintains that Spectre’s data collection was permitted under – since changed – rules it had about the use of its APIs for research means. However, Cambridge Analytica’s use of the data was not permitted; however, all Facebook did when it was notified back in 2015 was demand little more than the company’s promise that the data had been deleted.","Now, the saga has caught the attention of US lawmakers. Ron Wyden, an Oregon senator, has asked Mark Zuckerberg to explain not only the specific incident involving Cambridge Analytica, but Facebook’s measures around third-party collection and user of user data as a whole. The senator has given Zuckerberg & Co. until April 13, 2018 to respond.","Among the comments Senator Wyden makes in his letter is the observation that Facebook seemingly only stopped both Spectre and Cambridge Analytica from accessing its platform this past week, and even then only – he suggests – because at least two newspapers were planning to expose the situation. He asks how many such incidents have taken place in the past decade, and how Facebook handled them, and demands an explanation as to why it took this long for the company to ban the political firm. He also asks whether Facebook has notified users that their data may have been inappropriately collected or used.","“The troubling reporting on the ease with which Cambridge Analytica was able to exploit Facebook’s default privacy settings for profit and political gain throws into question not only the prudence and desirability of Facebook’s business practices and the dangers of monetizing consumers’ private information,” Sen. Wyden writes, “but also raises serious concerns about the role Facebook played in facilitating and permutation the covert collection and misuse of consumer information. With little oversight – and no meaningful intervention from Facebook – Cambridge Analytica was able to use Facebook-developed and marketed tools to weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.”","For Facebook, it’s signs of a tricky time ahead. Election manipulation remains a hot topic, not least with the Mueller investigation ongoing as it seeks to ascertain what role Russian influences may have played in electing President Trump. With lawmakers wading in, the big risk for the social network is that new regulations around how it operates could well be the next step."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Cambridge Analytica rejected the allegations, saying in a statement that the Channel 4 report “is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”","Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from the US Congress after the reports in the New York Times and London’s Observer over the weekend. Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Widen sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties.","Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organisations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.

At the time, apps could scrape data from both their users and the friends of those users, unless you had your privacy setting sufficiently locked down.","The company actually built an \"Anonymous Login\" tool that was specifically created so that Facebook users could log into third-party services without making all of their data available to developers.","But the once-hyped feature never launched. Facebook quietly killed the project, allegedly due to lack of interest.","That wasn't supposed to be the case, though. Anonymous Login was one of the first new features announced at Facebook's annual F8 developer conference in 2014, billed as part of a new effort to put \"people first.\"","\"We know that some people are scared of pressing this blue button,\" Zuckerberg said, referring to the now-ubiquitous \"login in with Facebook\" button. \"We don't ever want anyone to be surprised about how they're sharing on Facebook, that's not good for anyone.\"","The solution: an alternative Facebook login that would allow users to sign up to use an app without handing over personal data to the developer. Called Anonymous Login, the tool offered the same ease of use as the normal Facebook login, but Facebook would keep your identity anonymous to the developer.","Facebook's 'Anonymous Login' feature that never launched.","Image: facebook","\"The idea are is that even if you don't want an app to know who you are yet, you still want a streamlined experience of singing in,\" Zuckerberg said. \"This is going to let you try apps without fear.\"","But even though the feature was showcased prominently during Zuckerberg's keynote, it never launched. Not only that, Facebook barely mentioned it ever again.","The company confirmed that it officially killed the feature in August 2015, 16 months after the initial announcement, due to lack of interest from developers. As Recode reported that year, there was little incentive for developers to adopt the login feature.","Developers, much like Facebook, love data. The more they know about their users, the more effectively they can target them with ads, or figure out how to get them to spend more time in their apps. This is impossible to do without knowing their actual identity.","But it also seems that Facebook did very little to encourage developers to adopt the feature, either. It never launched more widely beyond the initial group of developers, for one. And, despite touting it as part of a new \"people first\" approach, the company didn't seem to care much at the end of they day whether it was actually used.","To be clear, Anonymous Login couldn't have prevented the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. By all accounts, the data in question had already been obtained by the time Facebook introduced the feature.","But it's an idea that's worth revisiting knowing now what we should have known then about the consequences of handing over all our data to Facebook's developers so willingly. At a time when distrust of Facebook, and the services that plug into it, is at an all-time high, having a feature like Anonymous Login could help users feel like they have some semblance of control over their data.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

The social media giant formally announced changes it claims will make it easier for users to control what they share in a post titled “It’s Time to Make Our Privacy Tools Easier to Find.”","The release, authored by Facebook’s Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan and Deputy General Counsel Ashlie Beringer, touts improved functionality and design of individual privacy settings on the platform. But that is something it’s been promising since 2006. The release employed stock language that Facebook has trotted out repeatedly when faced with questions over how it handles user data and privacy.","Since 2006, Facebook has repeatedly promised to safeguard users’ data through redesigns and by putting privacy controls front and center. Each time they claim to have heard and acted on feedback from users.","Here are some key passages from each of those updates.","March 2018: “Put people in control of their privacy”","In this most recent release, Facebook says, “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find and that we must do more to keep people informed. We’re taking additional steps in the coming weeks to put people more in control of their privacy.” Egan and Beringer added that the features have been “in the works for some time.”","January 2017: Making privacy tools “easy to find”","In this release on Data Privacy Day, Facebook announced an initiative to make privacy controls easier to find: a feature titled “Privacy Basics.” The company wrote, “Built using your feedback, everything is organized so that information about protecting your privacy is easy to find.” The purpose of this tool was to put already existing controls front-and-center, giving the user control over what they were sharing, and with whom.","September 2014: “Be in control of what you share”","In this release, Facebook introduced a new tool called “Privacy Checkup.” Product manager Paddy Underwood wrote: “We know you come to Facebook to connect with friends, not with us. But we also know how important it is to be in control of what you share and who you share with.” The feature presented users with a three-step process to modify who could see their posts, applications that are connected to their account and who could view personal details on their profiles.","May 2010: “A simpler way to control their information”","Around this time, Facebook users, internet advocacy groups, and politicians had expressed concern about how account data was being used on Facebook. CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post where he discussed changing privacy controls on the site. In summary, these changes purported to give users more control over what other users, advertisers and connected applications could and could not see on profiles and, for the first time, claimed it would consolidate all the settings on one page, just as it did on Wednesday.","In a wide-ranging press release, Facebook claimed to be “redesigning privacy.” “Over the past few weeks, the number one thing we’ve heard is that many users want a simpler way to control their information,” the release said. “Today we’re starting to roll out changes that will make our controls simpler and easier.”","“New settings will give the more than 400 million people who use Facebook the power to control exactly who can see the information and content they share, all with just a few simple clicks,” it continued. “In addition, new settings will be added to make it easier to turn off third-party applications or websites.”","December 2009: “Making the controls easy, intuitive”","In a response to feedback from Facebook users and online experts, the Vice President of Communications, Public Policy and Marketing contributed to an extensive release where Facebook again made design promises: “[M]any users have expressed that the current set of privacy choices are confusing or overwhelming. In response, the Privacy Settings page has been completely redesigned with a goal of making the controls easy, intuitive and accessible.”","At the bottom of the release, the company wrote, “Facebook has never shared personal information with advertisers except under the direction and control of a user. These new tools do not alter that policy or practice.”","March 2008: “Giving users more control”","In this release, Facebook announced privacy updates that would give users — you guessed it — greater control over the visibility of their content to specific individuals, writing, “Facebook will be introducing privacy updates that give users more control over the information they choose to share on Facebook.”","September 2006: “Additional controls for news feed”","At this time, Facebook called themselves a “social utility” in one of their first press releases on privacy, announcing, “additionalcontrols for News Feed and Mini-Feed in response to user feedback and to reaffirm its commitment to industry-leading privacy practices.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

It is, in Orwell’s words, “an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the wall ... The instrument could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely.","“The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it; moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment ... You had to live – did live, from habit that became instinct – in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinised.”","Winston Smith (“6079 Smith W”) knows to keep his back to the telescreen as much as possible and, when facing it, to wear an “expression of quiet optimism”.","“It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen ... To wear an improper expression on your face was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called”.","For most of my life, ever since I read Orwell as a teenager, I have thanked God that I didn’t end up as a citizen of Airstrip One, living my life as a helot in thrall to Big Brother. It was not long after the actual year 1984, when I made my first visit to the Soviet Union, that I realised a significant part of humanity was in precisely that situation.","The Soviets lacked the technological skill to create the telescreen, but their system of surveillance – based on countless concealed microphones and cameras – did the job. Everything else about Soviet life was straight out of Nineteen Eighty-Four, particularly the disconnect between the strident propaganda (the pig-iron statistics and the military parades) and the dispiriting shabbiness of everyday life. How relieved I felt to return to capitalism and democracy.","Little did I know that the freest society in history – that of northern California – was already hard at work on the technology that would not only match but exceed the telescreen as a tool of surveillance.","The internet and the World Wide Web, according to Silicon Valley pioneers such as John Perry Barlow, were supposed to create a libertarian paradise where netizens could roam free, beyond the reach of Big Brother and his ilk. As for making money ... the whole idea was just to connect the world.","“Facebook was not originally created to be a company,” wrote Mark Zuckerberg, its chairman and chief executive, on the eve of its initial public offering. “It was built to accomplish a social mission – to make the world more open and connected.” He had told The Harvard Crimson in 2004, only five days after the launch of Thefacebook, that his aim was not to make money: “I’m not going to sell anybody’s email address.”","Five years later, by which time Facebook had about 200 million users, Zuckerberg was asked by the BBC: “So who is going to own the Facebook content? The person who puts it there or you?” He replied: “The person who puts the content on Facebook always owns the information.”","BBC: “And you won’t sell it?”","MZ: “No, of course not.”","This was a disingenuous reply. To be sure, Zuckerberg has not – strictly speaking – sold Facebook users’ data. But he did not become a multibillionaire because all two billion users mailed him US$20 to say: “Thanks for making the world more connected.”","In 2007, Facebook allowed users to build apps within its site – a decision that proved hugely popular as Facebook-based games proliferated. At the same time, users could sell their own sponsored advertisements.","Zuckerberg’s pursuit of advertising revenue nearly backfired with the introduction of Beacon, which gave companies direct access to the platform. It was Sheryl Sandberg’s job to make the transition to an advertising revenue model a success, as she had already done at Google.","The crucial difference was that Google simply helped people find the things they had already decided to buy, whereas Facebook enabled advertisers to deliver targeted messages to users, tailored to meet the preferences they had already revealed through their Facebook activity. Once adverts were seamlessly inserted into users’ news feeds on the Facebook mobile phone app, the company was on the path to vast profits, propelled by the explosion of smartphone usage.","The smartphone is our telescreen. And, thanks to it, Big Zucker is watching you – night and day, wherever you go. Unlike the telescreen, your phone is always with you. Unlike the telescreen, it can read your thoughts, predicting your actions before you even carry them out. It’s just that Big Zucker’s 24/7 surveillance isn’t designed to maintain a repressive regime. It’s simply designed to make money.","The only law of history is the law of unintended consequences. Is anyone – apart from Zuckerberg, that is – really surprised that, during the eight-year period when app developers had free access to Facebook users’ data, unscrupulous people downloaded and used as much as they could? Do we seriously believe that Aleksandr Kogan and Cambridge Analytica are the only ones who did this? Can you give me one good reason why, after US president Barack Obama and his minions smugly boasted about their use of Facebook in his 2012 re-election campaign, Donald Trump’s campaign was not entitled to try similar methods four years later?","So it goes, Mark. You set out to make the world more connected. You end up helping to elect Trump, whose goal is – as we saw last week – the exact opposite. And all because you got greedy. You took Trump’s money. And you took Vladimir Putin’s, too.","The reputational damage has now been done. Regulation is coming, not to mention hefty fines. (As Zuckerberg himself said last week: “I actually am not sure we shouldn’t be regulated.”) But the big question is how many people will actually leave Facebook.","In Nineteen Eighty-Four, only members of the party elite are allowed to turn off their telescreens. For everyone else, they are compulsory. But our iTelescreens are different, for we are addicted to them. As Sean Parker, the company’s first president, recently admitted, Facebook was set up to exploit “a vulnerability in human psychology” by delivering “a little dopamine hit every once in a while”.","It took torture – followed by copious amounts of gin – to finally convince Winston Smith that “he loved Big Brother”. In that respect, too, Zuckerberg has gone one better than Orwell: “It was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He liked Big Zucker”.","Niall Ferguson’s The Square and the Tower will soon be available in paperback from Penguin"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

About seven minutes into the video, when the soldiers Ahed had attacked – supported by her mother and a cousin – had left, Ahed was asked by her mother to send a “message to the world.” As you can see in this subtitled clip, Ahed seemed embarrassed for a moment, but then she responded by dutifully repeating the slogans she had grown up with.","“I wish that everybody would participate in demonstrations because that is the only way for us to get results; because our strength is in our stones; and I wish that everybody all over the world would unite so we can liberate Palestine, because Trump must bear responsibility for the decision he took for any Palestinian reaction – be it stabbings, martyrdom-seeking operations [i.e. suicide bombings], throwing stones – everyone must do something. So we can unite this way, so we can get our message across in the required way and get this result, that is the liberation of Palestine, Allah willing.”","As shocking as it is to hear a girl who is just approaching her 17th birthday (on January 31) to casually list “stabbings” and “martyrdom-seeking operations” among the actions she wants others to take in support of her cause, there is no doubt that Ahed’s mother was pleased to hear her daughter express exactly the views she had been taught throughout her childhood.","Already two years ago, I documented in detail that Ahed’s mother, Nariman Tamimi, has long been an ardent and outspoken supporter of terrorism. When the so-called “stabbing intifada” began in autumn 2015, Nariman Tamimi shared a Facebook post with graphic instructions on where to aim a knife to achieve a lethal outcome. Whenever there was a terror attack targeting Israelis, Nariman Tamimi would again take to Facebook and praise the perpetrator as a hero. No act of murder was too gruesome: in June 2016, after a teenaged Palestinian terrorist broke into a home and killed a 13-year-old sleeping Israeli girl in her bedroom, Ahed’s mother shared a Facebook post from another Tamimi family member that praised this savage act for “return[ing] to the homeland its awe/reverence.”","Nariman Tamimi also ensured everyone knew that her admiration for Palestinian terrorists extended to those who had perpetrated attacks before there was Facebook. She shared a post that praised several notorious female Palestinian terrorists as admirable “rebels;” these terrorists had murdered 55 Israelis, including 21 children, and wounded more than 300 people.","Among the four terrorists glorified in Nariman Tamimi’s post were two that Ahed knows well. One is her aunt Ahlam Tamimi, who planned and helped perpetrate the bombing of a crowded Sbarro pizzeria in Jerusalem in August 2001. 15 people lost their lives, including seven children and a pregnant woman; some 130 more were injured, with one young mother left in a permanent vegetative state.","In the summer of 2012, Ahlam Tamimi married Ahed’s uncle Nizar Tamimi, who was involved in the 1993 murder and subsequent burning of Chaim Mizrahi, whose killing was claimed by Hamas and described in a report at the time as “an attack by extremists determined to disrupt the peace process by provoking Jewish anger.” As a little girl, you can see Ahed on the stage with the terrorist couple, clapping to the music, right after the start of the second minute of this video.","A few months ago, Ahed had a photo opportunity with Leila Khaled, another of the terrorists that her mother admires as a “rebel”. A recently posted tweet shows that Ahed’s supporters hope that she will become “the next Leila Khaled.”","Leila Khaled is a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which is notorious for having “pioneered such terror tactics as airline hijackings;” the group also perpetrated “hundreds of terrorist attacks.” Leila Khaled “is credited as the first woman to hijack an airplane.”","According to a report in the European Jewish Press, the event that featured both Leila Khaled and Ahed Tamimi was hosted by two far-left Spanish Members of the European Parliament in September 2017. Ahed Tamimi reportedly told her audience: “The occupation is not only the theft of land. We oppose racism, Zionism, the entire system of occupation and not only the settlements.” This faithfully echoes the views Ahed’s father, Bassem Tamimi, had expressed during a U.S. speaking tour in 2015, when he described Israel as “a big settlement” and denounced “the colonial project” of Zionism – which is well understood by activists as a rejection of Israel’s right to exist in any borders.","Leila Khaled used the platform given to her to praise extremist violence and demonize Jews. ‘Don’t you see a similarity between Nazi actions and Zionist actions in Gaza? … While the Nazis were tried in Nuremberg, no one has ever tried the Zionists,’ she asked the audience.","The event was eventually sharply criticized, which prompted the European Parliament to endorse a proposal “to systematically deny access to all persons, groups, or entities involved in terrorist acts.”","It is also noteworthy that the images posted by Ahed’s supporters on Twitter reveal that the event in Brussels included the participation of Ahed and her father, Bassem Tamimi, in a campaign for Georges Abdallah. Abdallah is “a Lebanese militant”, who was arrested in 1984 and sentenced to life in prison in 1987 for the murder of Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Ray, an assistant U.S. military attaché. He was also found guilty for the murder of Israeli diplomat Yaakov Bar-Simantov, as well as his involvement an assassination attempt on former American consul Robert O. Homme.","In September, Ahed posted a picture on her Facebook page that reflects the perverted “values” she was brought up with. The image shows gunmen masked with Palestinian keffiyeh scarves, and Ahed repeated the message written on the image in Arabic: “Tell the fighters all over the world that they are my friends.”","Ahed Tamimi cannot be blamed for the childhood she had. But the media can be blamed for ignoring the Tamimis’ ardent support for terrorism. By deceiving people about the Tamimis’ agenda and methods, their supporters only reinforce the family’s efforts to cynically exploit their children to ignite a “third intifada” – a Palestinian uprising to bring about the replacement of the world’s only Jewish state with yet another Arab-Muslim majority country."],"isopubdate":"2018-09-04"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

The irony was that a president who wants only the smartest and best-looking immigrants was embracing a nation once known for sending famine-stricken, disease-laden, crime-breeding foreigners to our shores.","For that matter, how did Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, the gay son of a Hindu father of Indian descent, merit time from a president who has stirred up a thousand little hatreds from the darkest corners of America?","The Taoiseach got his moment because on St. Patrick’s Day everybody wants to be Irish. But no one in power has betrayed the Irish-American story more than President Trump. He’s been joined by a handful of Hibernian toadies who have made a mockery of their heritage.","Earlier in the week, the prime minister of a tiny nation tried to nudge the mighty United States back to the moral high ground. “It’s really tough to see a country that is built on freedom not being a world leader in that space anymore,” he told an audience in Austin, Tex.","Varadkar also visited the Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma, thanking them for sending donations during a famine in which a million Irish died. His gesture was in the tradition of Irish who never forget where they came from — a narrative of struggle can help the United States in its dark hour under Trump.","St. Patrick’s Day has long been a festival of memory — that is, before the peddlers of paddywackery got ahold of it. The burden of bad years includes not just the Great Hunger, but also coffin ships that left for America filled with intact families and arrived with many orphans.","The president who is afraid that Haitians “all have AIDS” would likely have turned back ships packed with Irish dying from typhus, a particularly odious and painful way to go, spread by lice in tight quarters.","But that’s the memory, along with the triumph of the Irish in America — overcoming those odds, and a Know-Nothing movement that tried to strip them of their humanity.","Nineteenth-century America was blessed with Abraham Lincoln to counter the haters. If the Know-Nothings had their way, said Lincoln, the Declaration of Independence would have read, “all men are created equal except Negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.”","We’re stuck with Trump, the most un-American of presidents, who never misses a chance to stoke xenophobic fears. In trying to erase our history, his administration recently removed the phrase “America’s promise as a nation of immigrants” from the federal agency dealing with immigrants.","Trump has had help from a handful of Celtic cowards. Steve Bannon leads that rogues’ gallery. Who is he afraid of? Well, everybody. He would have hated his ancestors, who arrived in the United States in the 1850s. After stuffing white nationalist, America First nonsense into the malleable brain of Trump, he’s now doing the same with French anti-Semites and immigrant-bashers.","“Let them call you racists,” he told the far-right National Front Party last week. “Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativists. Wear it as a badge of honor.”","Vice President Mike Pence, whose grandmother came from County Clare, once invoked the struggles of his family to support immigrants living in the shadows. He now sits passive and mute while his administration strands the Dreamers and moves to cut legal immigration by half. Among the undocumented immigrants in this country, by the way, are an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 Irish.","Pence, an evangelical Christian, has learned to strike a pious pose whenever anyone brings up his boss’s alleged romp with a porn star or his boasting about sexual assault. What gets his Irish up are gays; he has a history of opposing full citizen rights for Americans who aren’t heterosexual.","Amnesia about your past is nothing new in this country. We’ve all reinvented ourselves to some degree. But it’s one thing to forget where you came from. It’s another to betray that history with backwards public policy.","“The hottest place in Hell should be reserved this St. Patrick’s Day for the Irish who want to pull up the ladder, shut the doors of Ellis Island and turn off the lamp at the Statue of Liberty,” Niall O’Dowd, a founder of the IrishCentral media empire, wrote this week.","The way forward is to look to the teachable past, as Conor Lamb, the recently elected Democrat to Congress from Trump Country, has done. In his campaign, he embraced his Irish Catholic heritage, noting that immigrants are good for America by almost every measurement.","Lamb often mentioned John F. Kennedy, who spoke of America as “the great experiment” — a country trying to form a common bond without a common ancestry. It was an audacious idea then, and still is, but it hangs in the balance."],"isopubdate":"2018-06-08"}

In many ways, it was inevitable. Still, it has taken a public car crash for the ugly truth behind a cuddly facade to be revealed, leaving the public disgusted and a once-trusted brand in tatters.","No, not the farcical career apocalypse of a certain Mr Saturday Night. Nor the driverless Uber car that ran over a pedestrian in Arizona. In a week of widely-publicised car crashes, perhaps the most significant was Facebook’s global meltdown, a PR disaster where many users finally woke up to the fact they were merely disposable batteries powering the information economy.","Still, what do I know? I’m just a “dumb f***”. And so are you, according to the ubiquitous social network’s founder Mark Zuckerberg. Back when he was a young shaver at the prestigious Harvard University, the teen tech titan used this somewhat unsavoury term to describe those signing up for his new piece of software, The Facebook.","It has to be said he had a point. Zuckerberg may have dropped out of uni – an act some consider quite high on the dumb f*** scale itself – but he quickly amassed a $75 billion fortune. Me? I got my qualifications – but an ability to spot a yellow discount sticker from 20ft away is now my most valuable asset.","But once upon a time, Zuckerberg genuinely couldn’t believe people were willingly handing over their personal information to him. “They just trust me,” he told a friend, incredulously. A real one, apparently, not an employee, his wife or Alexa. It’s a telling statement that might just yet become his ironic epitaph.","This week’s hoo-ha concerns a publicity-shy firm called Cambridge Analytica (although readers of this paper might remember our expose on the company early last year) and how it amassed information from 50 million Facebook users. But let’s be clear – any foul play here wasn’t by Facebook. The firm quite blatantly tells you on its terms and conditions that it will suck your soul from your body and sell it to anyone who’ll pay.","What didn’t let you in on this open secret was an innocuous wee third-party personality quiz which millions of users took part in, including myself. You probably found out you were a genius Adonis too. Its programmer wasn’t simply having a bit of fun, however – it was clear subterfuge, an app designed specifically to harvest data through the backdoor to be sold on to interested clients.","The funny thing is, Barack Obama also had an app on Facebook which gorged itself on users’ personal details. The difference being that the Yes We Can download said on the tin that it wholly existed to absorb all your secrets – in particular, who your friends are and their political leanings.","So this wasn’t a “breach”, as such. Facebook operated exactly the way it was built to – adhering to everything you agreed to when you joined up. So will you quit the habit now that the truth is out there? No, because Facebook’s already bought up all the competition in the event of such a rainy day. It’s here to stay. No-one’s going back to Bebo. Because they weren’t there in the first place.","But why is Zuckerberg now donning his sweat-stained everyman T-shirt on CNN to apologise if this wasn’t an actual hack? Well, share prices are down nearly seven per cent, shaving $61bn dollars off Facebook’s market rating and slicing $8bn off the top of Zuckerberg’s personal pile. He’ll break his neck diving into that coin-filled Scrooge McDuck swimming pool at this rate.","NOTHING IS FREE","THE unmistakable whiff of bovine excrement that accompanied Facebook’s contrite apology this week was demonstrative of the bunker mentality tech behemoths adopt when the real reason for their existence threatens to become common knowledge. Let’s be clear, no-one is sorry.","Yet, this wee public relations meltdown has certainly reminded layman social media users of a maxim that is as old as time – nothing comes for free. And if it does, then you are the profit. All those great free apps on your phone? Tracking your every twitch – where you park your car, how long you spend in a shop, how long you lunch for, what you bought with your contactless card, how many times you buy it and also if you stop buying it near the end of the month as money gets tight. Maybe you just need some targeted advertising. Perhaps an overdraft or loan so you don’t need to go without. It’s slowly dawning on us that apps are not our friends – they are cheerleading yes men, facilitating our weaknesses like Michael Jackson’s doctor.","So, what actually did happen this week? Simply put, nothing users didn’t agree to. People did their jobs and did them well, on both sides of the fluffed-up controversy. Credit is due to The Guardian’s instincts for a story, but in truth all it told us was the grass is green, the sky is blue and in other, more salacious news pages, that you should never, ever get behind the wheel when you can afford Morgan Freeman as a chauffeur.","THE END OF THE UNIVERSE","DON’T take it personally, but the ultimate fate of humanity is quite insignificant to astrophysicists like the late, great Stephen Hawking. Even Earth is an arbitrary concern, the planet’s entire existence just a fingersnap lost in eternity’s infinite timescale. The big picture at the forefront of these academics’ minds is how the universe began and (a particular obsession for Hawking) how it will end.","Over the course of his lifetime, the late professor subscribed to opposing beliefs – that the cosmos would either tear itself apart or slowly dim into eternal darkness. His most grandly grim paper, A Smooth Exit From Eternal Inflation, was released just a fortnight before his death and predicts the universe slowly fading to a black, frozen nothingness. Not with a bang, or even a whimper, as the galaxies eventually run out of fuel to recycle.","Earlier in his career, Hawking actually predicted a more violent end to all things, pointing the finger of blame at the then-undiscovered Higgs boson particle. This once-theoretical building block of reality is thought to be the reason why anything exists physically – bestowing matter with mass. Hawking had warned, however: “The Higgs has the worrisome feature that it might become metastable. This could mean that the universe could undergo catastrophic vacuum decay. This could happen at any time and we wouldn’t see it coming.”","If true, this means a single unstable molecule has the potential to wipe out the entire universe at the speed of light. No immediate cause for alarm, however – the universe is so large that it’s been estimated that even if this has happened somewhere, it could take 10 to the power of 139 years to consume everything that exists. To clarify, that’s 10 with 139 zeroes. So you can put off that phone call to mum, you’ve plenty of time.","Hawking was not content with predicting our molecules being torn apart during an eternal, starless night, however. In 2015, he joined Russian billionaire Yuri Milner to form the Breakthrough Initiative, where supercharged computers listen to the cosmos for extraterrestrial radio signals. And true to his personality, this was a contradictory act.","“One day, we might receive a signal from another planet, but we should be wary of answering back,” he warned, while listening for a signal from another planet and waiting to answer back.","Hawking’s peculiar duality, in particular how he viewed our species’ localised importance and cosmic insignificance, can perhaps be summed up by his poetic variation on Arthur C Clarke’s famous musing: “Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.”","Hawking echoed the science-fiction author’s sentiments with a chilling rhetorical question: “Somewhere in the cosmos, intelligent life may be watching our lights, aware of what they mean. Or do our lights wander a lifeless cosmos, unseen beacons announcing that here on our rock, the universe discovered its existence?”","So either we’re not alone, or we are all there is – perhaps just thought machines created by a universe trying to understand itself. And like Clarke’s summation of our place in the grand scheme of things, both possibilities are equally terrifying.","STARSAILOR HAWKING NOW FREE FROM GRAVITY","PROFESSOR Stephen Hawking was the living embodiment of contradiction. His mind, a sparkling mirrorball illuminating the blackest holes of cosmic mystery. His body, simply an anchor tethering a starsailor to Earth.","It’s not a stretch to suggest Hawking was something of a psychonaut – a fearlessly inquisitive test pilot for the outer limits of thought. Much revelation and enlightenment was gifted to him upon transcendent explorations of the universe within. In his own words: “In my mind, I am free.”","In defiance of death, the fruits of such free minds often seed for generations. Yet, even the brightest flickers of consciousness will fail to register a stitch in the eternal canvas of infinity. No matter our intellect or creativity, our achievements or impact, the kaleidoscopic, mercurial, indefinable true selves we harbour within will be condensed to caricature by those we leave behind, hazy mirages of who we are carved into stone for posterity.","What will make such cosy, broad-stroke deification of Hawking especially difficult will be his myriad personality quirks, which often gave rise to inconsistency and contradiction. Perhaps such personal obscurification was deliberate, such was the professor's wilful impishness and unwillingness to be easily defined or compartmentalised.","Despite a surface level optimism regarding our species’ potential to seed the stars, in reality Hawking’s musings often condemned homo sapien to the bleakest of self-perpetuating outcomes. It’s true that the human race was not always to blame for its own demise in his most futurist indulgences – malevolent aliens or rogue AIs might swing the sword, depending on his mood. Yet, it was encroaching environmental catastrophe that always loomed large for Hawking. Perhaps this most analytical of soothsayers was being deliberately contentious by actually giving a date, but his prediction of the year 2600 for overpopulation to eventually buckle the planet was a projection far enough into the future that he'd never be held to account for it.","For such a renowned humanitarian, the uneasy truths behind his mathematical models and intellectual intuition –coupled with our species’ propensity for pollution and war – must have sat uneasy on Hawking's conscience and outlook. Especially for someone so reliant on the best of human nature for his continued existence. Yet later in life, in less guarded moments, his unerring conviction that we were doomed was all too obvious. “The human failing I would most like to correct is aggression,” he said. “It may have had survival advantage in caveman days, to get more food, territory or partner with whom to reproduce, but now it threatens to destroy us all.”","As for his own mortality and legacy, Hawking was unsentimental and far from spiritual in outlook. \"I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken-down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.” Yet, if a star is a simply a light which gives meaning to such darkness, Hawking was a very lucky astrophysicist indeed – one who could study such luminance at close quarters.","Comments","Comments & Moderation","Readers’ comments: You are personally liable for the content of any comments you upload to this website, so please act responsibly.

For instance, it posted videos with the hashtag WeMissYouToo on the official Meri Maggi Facebook page.","The company was “encouraged by the public announcements by Facebook around strengthening data protection,” the Nestle spokesperson said. But “we are concerned by this issue as our business, both online and offline, relies on a strong foundation of trust with our consumers”.","Digitial advertising is gaining ground amid greater smartphone use and faster 4G connections. A report by Dentsu Aegis Network released in January this year forecast that the Rs 8,200 crore Indian digital advertising industry will grow by a compounded annual growth rate of 32% to Rs 18,986 crore by 2020, with fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and ecommerce being the two single largest spenders on advertising. Two people who track the industry closely estimated the Indian advertising expenditure on Facebook at Rs 1,700-1,800 crore.","India overtook the US in Facebook membership last July, crossing the 240-million active user mark, making it one of the most critical markets for the company.","ITC, another top 10 advertiser, also expressed a broader concern over the spread of fake news through the platform, echoing sentiments earlier expressed by global consumer goods giant Unilever.","“Certain concerns including ever increasing fake profiles and proliferation of fake news through Facebook need to be addressed on an urgent basis,” said Hemant Malik, ITC divisional chief executive, foods. “Facebook is a large media platform. They have recently changed the algorithm which makes Facebook similar to any other media channel as opposed to being a social media channel, where brands would look for engagement or conversation with users.”","PepsiCo is another large advertiser that has been steadily increasing its media spending on social platforms to resonate with its core consumers — millennials. “Responsiveness and authenticity will be the key parameters that brands will be evaluated on by consumers on social media,” said PepsiCo India senior vice president, beverages, Vipul Prakash.","PepsiCo’s core brands — Pepsi cola, Mountain Dew and Nimbooz — are all targeted at young consumers. “The social media landscape in India is one of the largest and continuously evolving,” Prakash said. “With multiple platforms, all stakeholders across social media platforms, advertisers and media agencies will need to work together to ensure that communications by brands to consumers appears in a relevant context.” Facebook India said clients are happy with the steps that the company is taking to safeguard user data.","Allaying Concerns“Advertisers look to us to help grow their businesses,” spokesperson for Facebook India said. “They know how important it is for people to trust their information with Facebook. Most of the businesses we’ve spoken with this week are pleased with the steps we’ve outlined to better protect people’s data, and they have confidence that we’ll respond to these challenges and become a better partner and company as a result.” The social media company will work with customers to assuage their concerns.","“We’ve seen a handful of reports of clients pausing while they’re assessing these steps we’ve outlined yesterday,” the Facebook spokesperson said.","“We’re going to work closely with them — and with all of our clients.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg belatedly apologised last week for not being able to prevent political advertising firm Cambridge Analytica from getting access to the personal data of 50 million users without their knowledge. He said security would be increased and apps vetted more rigourously to prevent meddling in elections this year in India, the US and elsewhere.","Biscuit giant Parle Products said it took user data security seriously. “Data breach across any social media is a big cause of concern for us,” said Krishna Rao, category head at biscuit giant Parle Products. “When we do target-based advertising, we are under the opinion that consumer data is private. We would want to restrain from advertising on any social media platform that puts data at risk.”","Anusha Shetty, chief executive of Autumn Worldwide, a social media agency, said: “Security is the biggest challenge the industry faces and as creators and enablers in this domain, we must all play an active role to ensure we protect and secure consumers on the internet.”","Last month, the country’s biggest advertiser, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) said it would reduce its spending on online and social media platforms such as Google and Facebook if they didn’t filter out content that was divisive or promoted gender stereotypes and hatred, in line with Dutch parent Unilever’s new global policy. An email seeking comment on the matter from ecommerce giant Amazon, which spends a significant amount on social media, remained unanswered.","According to the Denstu Aegis Network report, growth in the digital landscape is being fuelled by the rollout of 4G, falling data costs and higher smartphone penetration. The report added that expenditure on digital platforms, which contribute 15% of the overall advertising pie, will reach 24% of the entire market by 2020. Within the digital space, social media contributes the majority 28%.","0Comments","Are you a Business Owner? Get Your Free Business Listing on Economic Times."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

She was widely seen as the winner that night in Las Vegas and the favorite to win the presidency weeks later.","On Facebook, however, a different story was unfolding for millions of Americans, whose feeds were being saturated with eye-catching ads bolstering Trump.","Out of view of the broader public, the site was serving as a platform for an intense barrage of advertisements tailored to reach Trump's supporters with maximum impact throughout the debate day and night. By the end of the day, the Trump campaign had run 175,000 variations of ads on Facebook, pushing distinct versions to different users to test which ones worked best. The high-velocity churn drew $9 million in donations, the campaign's biggest single-day money haul of the year.","Facebook's recent revelations that it sold thousands of ads to a Russian troll operation seeking to foment discord during last year's elections have led its executives to pledge cooperation with U.S. investigators. But the company's role in the Russia probe is also prompting uncomfortable scrutiny of its increasingly lucrative political advertising business and how little is known about the ads voters are exposed to online.","The situation has the potential to affect a key profit center for Facebook. The same proprietary technology that has made Facebook the go-to advertising platform for political campaigns also enabled Russian operatives to target U.S. voters with inflammatory ads. Now lawmakers, noting that online companies are not subject to disclosure rules governing broadcast advertising, are calling for tighter regulations as Facebook is poised to play another major role in the 2018 and 2020 elections.","Trump strategists credit their victory in part to a decision to go all-in on Facebook in the closing stretch of the 2016 race, with a strategy that was orchestrated from a San Antonio office where Trump campaign and Republican Party staffers worked alongside Facebook sales employees, blitzing the country with ads.","By Election Day, Trump's campaign had spent roughly $70 million on Facebook alone — nearly all in the last four months of the election, according to people familiar with the spending.","\"If you imagine the country as the haystack, Facebook is the needle finder,\" said Brad Parscale, who served as the Trump campaign's digital director.","With 210 million U.S. users logging in monthly, Facebook offers candidates and their allies the ability to zero in on potential voters who are likely to embrace their messages and make them go viral — identifying them by geography, gender, interests and their behavior across the Internet, including their \"likes\" for music, food and travel. The company owes its rich trove of data to its users, who turn over details about their personal lives every time they engage with the platform.","The large sums invested by the Trump campaign would have been enough to put an ad on the feed of every Facebook user in the country, digital strategists said, or to send multiple ads to key voters. The online bombardment, which former Clinton aides acknowledged surpassed their Facebook spending, was largely invisible to the media and the electorate. That's because of its highly personalized design, which allows advertisers to target voters in a granular fashion.","Advocates for more online transparency say the 2016 election showed how Facebook and other websites can be used to push provocative messages with no oversight.","The news that Russians used Facebook to try to influence voters showed that people with \"no interest in adhering to facts or the truth are able to message to select pockets of the population to elicit an emotional response, and no one knows that it is happening,\" said Keegan Goudiss, who served as director of digital advertising for Sen. Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign, which relied heavily on Facebook.","After revealing the Russian ad buys, Facebook vowed to provide more transparency about political ads on its site, a move that could pull the curtain back on its position as a turbocharged platform for campaigns. After years of resisting disclosure, the company has pledged to create a mechanism that will reveal the content of political ads posted on its site, making them visible to any Facebook user. The system would go further than what is required of TV and cable stations, which have to disclose information about who purchases political ads but not the content of the ads themselves.","\"We are in a new world,\" Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a post last month. \"It is a new challenge for internet communities to deal with nation states attempting to subvert elections. But if that's what we must do, we are committed to rising to the occasion.\"","Still, the ongoing Russia probes could have a long-term impact on the company, which is now contending with new efforts to regulate online political advertising.","Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Mark R. Warner (Va.) plan to introduce a bill in the coming weeks that would require sites with more than 1 million users to maintain a public file containing a copy of political ads and information about who they are aimed at. The measure, which the lawmakers said was a direct response to the Russian effort, would require information about the number of views generated and the rates charged by platforms such as Facebook.","\"These ads are literally being seen by millions and millions of people, but there's really not the transparency that you see with traditional ads,\" Klobuchar said.","\"Aside from the Russia issue, it is a glaring problem because our technology has changed, the way people advertise has changed, but our laws are back in the 1980s,\" she added.","Facebook, which as recently as 2011 sought an exemption from the Federal Election Commission from having to run political disclaimers on the small ads that run on its site, has taken a cautious posture toward the prospect of new regulations even as it has pledged to provide more voluntary disclosure. The company said in a statement that it is \"open to reviewing any reasonable proposals.\"","Facebook's ascent in elections has been rapid, mirroring its sevenfold increase in value since the company went public in 2012. At the time, the company had just a handful of staffers in its Washington office focused on lobbying and on campaign advertising.","That year, the reelection campaign of President Barack Obama developed an innovative Facebook application, allowing 1 million supporters to give the campaign access to their extended Facebook \"friend\" networks.","The ability to tap into that kind of data free was shut down in 2015, when Facebook limited the amount of information that campaigns and other third-party groups can access from the site. As a result, campaigns still eager to tap into Facebook's fast-growing database began buying more ads, political strategists said.","While businesses still spend more on Google advertising, many political advertisers began favoring Facebook in 2014, campaign strategists said. The site's ability to offer rich targeting and near real-time feedback, as well as its role as a platform for civic debate, makes Facebook better tailored to political messaging, said Zac Moffatt, who heads the Republican digital ad agency Targeted Victory.","During the height of the 2016 campaign, Facebook had 10 staffers — five on the Democratic side and five on the Republican side — who helped federal campaigns with their ad buys, according to people familiar with the company's operations.","Unlike the Trump campaign, Clinton's team declined to have the company's sales employees work side-by-side with its staff, though Facebook employees did visit Clinton's Brooklyn headquarters from time to time, according to people familiar with the setup. Clinton, who entered the general election with more resources than Trump, was less reliant on Facebook, but her former campaign officials declined to share how much they spent on the platform.","Facebook regularly deploys sales staff to work with big corporate and political clients. Typically, Facebook employees provide advice to big clients on how to target users across all the company's platforms, including Instagram and Messenger, helping advertisers decipher which approaches would be likely to get the most engagement.","For example, Facebook might advise campaigns on whether to target a large number of potential voters in a specific Zip code, according to people familiar with the process.","When content goes viral, it helps Facebook make money. Advertisers pay for people to view an ad. They pay more money if people click on that ad or if they click through the ad to a page outside of Facebook or install an advertiser's application, advertisers say.","Goudiss, the former Sanders digital advertising director who is a partner at the firm Revolution Messaging, said the impact of Facebook on political races could not be overstated.","\"Facebook was one of the key reasons Bernie went from 2 percent name ID to winning primaries,\" he said.","The Trump campaign's large investment in Facebook was driven in part by necessity. When the wealthy real estate executive secured the GOP nomination in the late spring, he had virtually no fundraising operation.","Campaign officials and Republican Party strategists from Washington who embedded with the Trump digital shop in San Antonio turned to Facebook ads to rapidly build a donor list.","\"I knew that it would be a lead dog in the pack,\" said Gary Coby, who was dispatched from the Republican National Committee to serve as the campaign's director of digital advertising and fundraising. \"But we always built in the idea of a dynamic budget — you move the money to where it is best performing. Facebook was one of the things that was working, so we put more money and time into it.\"","More than half of the campaign's Facebook budget was spent on ads designed to pull in contributions, many of them featuring some of Trump's most provocative remarks. \"Only Trump can stop Crooked Hillary,\" declared one ad in June. \"Teach Hillary Who's Boss.\"","In a setup that officials said resembled a high-frequency Wall Street trading shop, the Trump operation pitted teams of staffers and outside ad buyers against each other to see which could get more Facebook users to convert into donors. Those who won got more money to play with.","Each day, the campaign would start with about 20,000 ad variations, testing different messages against a complex set of targeting factors such as age and device usage, as well as past actions such as recent donations. Throughout the day, they swapped in various images of Trump or short-burst videos with captions, hunting for the most viral combination.","\"You want to make sure you have all different ad variations and different segments for your ads so that you can find something that works fast, and then Facebook will show it to more people,\" Gerrit Lansing, the RNC's former chief digital officer, explained at a post-election political marketing conference sponsored by MediaPost in January.","\"You find these little bursts of things that work, and then pour gas on it and do that dozens of times every day,\" he added.","By the end of a typical day, the Trump operation averaged 40,000 to 60,000 ad variations — a supercharged version of the kind of comparative testing many campaigns use.","Like the Sanders campaign, the Trump team found that Facebook ads served multiple functions: as powerful fundraising appeals, as vehicles to win over new supporters, and eventually as a mechanism to prod voters to go to the polls, officials said.","The constant feedback the campaign received about how Facebook users engaged with different ads also provided valuable political insight into what moved Trump's supporters, campaign strategists said. After an intense round of testing showed that his backers responded strongly to messages about what Trump pledged to do in office, the campaign rolled out policy speeches featuring the candidate.","In the end, half of the Trump campaign's overall advertising budget was spent online — nearly double the share a typical campaign devotes to digital ads — and the majority of that went to Facebook.","\"People are coming to grips with the fact that the world's biggest social network is playing an unprecedented role in politics and in government in the distribution of ideas,\" said Alex Howard, deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan watchdog group. \"For many people, Facebook is the Internet. It is an extraordinarily powerful force with limited accountability.\""],"isopubdate":"2017-10-09"}

And the political consulting industry scours the victor’s tactics so they can be sold in the next election cycle, whether they worked, were happenstance, or a mix of the two.","Exhibit A for this dynamic is the 2016 Trump campaign’s use of digital media, especially Facebook. In late February, President Trump named Brad Parscale, his digital director, as his 2020 re-election campaign manager. In the meantime, Parscale has been helping the Republican Party raise millions from small donations online.","“It begs the question, why don’t more campaigns have their digital consultant serve as their campaign manager,” wrote Peter Graves, a media consultant and ex-RNC regional political director for the trade publication, Campaigns and Elections. \"After all, most federal campaigns are doing the majority of their voter contact now online. Moreover, digital is the only space on campaigns that collaborates with every department.”","SPONSORED","But what did Parscale do for Trump in 2016 that is setting the standard for 2018?","“If I had to characterize what the Trump campaign did, they automated Facebook’s best [advertising] practices at a very large scale. I think that statewide campaigns will try to do the same kind of thing in 2018,” said Colin Delany, founder of Epolitics. “I’m wondering if any new technology is going to come out of the resistance. It’s possible. I think a lot of what you are seeing is training and capacity building.”","In other words, Democrats are playing catchup to Republicans, compared to 2016, when their presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic National Committee—under a series of chairwomen—were more focused on older media platforms like TV, rather than new platforms like social media.","To begin to understand how Parscale, an online advertising specialist, went from building websites for Trump products, to running Trump’s online messaging and fundraising in 2016, to assisting the RNC with small donor outreach in 2018, to being named Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, you have to examine how Parscale used Facebook.","Consultants like Delany are quick to say they can’t tell you how the Trump campaign’s messaging specifically affected voters when they cast ballots. But they can say how Parscale used Facebook, which revolutionized how national campaigns targeted and messaged likely voters.","If you roll back the clock to before the internet, a baseline emerges showing how much has changed. When I was press secretary on the 1990 campaign that first elected Bernie Sanders to the House of Representatives, I remember picking up a half-dozen TV ads for the campaign’s final stretch. Bernie looked at the stack of 30-second videos and said his future rested on those tapes. That was a statewide race in a rural state with small media markets, but compare its scale to what Parscale and Facebook did for Trump.","It’s no secret. An October 2016 in-depth report by Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg for Bloomberg.com laid out the basics. It started with identifying persuadable voters in swing states, and then sending messaging poking at their biases and personality types. More recent reports, such as this weekend's Guardian report featuring a Trump campaign whistleblower, added more detail showing how powerful Facebook's user profiles were in 2016.","The Trump campaign took voter files from the Republican Party, which had people’s electoral histories—age, gender, address, party registration and voting histories. They took more personalized data by Cambridge Analytica, the data-mining firm run by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, which boasted it had psychological profiles of every voter. (On Friday, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica for not deleting data taken from the social network in 2016 to create its voter profiles. The Guardian reported Cambridge Analytica's data was culled from 50 million to 60 million Facebook user profiles it had stolen before it joined the Trump campaign.)","The campaign put all that voter profiling data into Facebook’s advertising supercomputers, which had its own deep profiles of users based on their pages, communications and networks. Facebook provided staffers to every major campaign in 2016 to facilitate this process. From that data merging and data mining, Parscale oversaw an operation that identified 13.5 million Facebook users in 16 states that it deemed were persuadable. It targeted those individuals with the kind of personality-driven content that social media emphasizes—more opinion, belief and bias than facts.","The Trump campaign didn’t just send out original content, noted Melissa Ryan, who writes the Ctrl Alt Right Delete newsletter. “The Trump campaign put out relatively few ideas of their own,” she explained on Medium.com. “Instead they chose to validate and amplify the conversation happening online. They didn’t need to confirm or deny anything, they simply gave Trump’s army their megaphone… [It] put their supporters one content front and center, taking a backseat in their own campaign.”","“They were banking that people are more likely to believe something from an unofficial source that seems true rather than to believe something from an official source that actually is true,” Ryan explained. “Once they realized there was no line to cross, they went all in using social media to bully and intimidate others, spread misinformation, and mainstream the language of hate. Those who spoke out were met with a flood of abuse, and that abuse was organized. Their targets had few places to turn as tech companies turned a blind eye, and law enforcement was of little help.”","By late October, days before former FBI director James Comey announced the FBI was reopening its investigation into Clinton’s handling of classified emails, the Bloomberg reporting team said Parscale’s crew of subcontractors had determined “which social media ads [messages, memes, shares, etc.] were most effective. Those companies test ad variations against one another—the campaign ultimately generated 100,000 distinct pieces of creative content—and then roll out the strongest performers to broader audiences.”","Facebook allowed Parscale to build and target what it calls “custom audiences,” as ex-Facebook executive Antonio Garcia-Martinez explained in a Wired piece, “How Trump Conquered Facebook—Without Russian Ads.” Its custom audience consisted of all the impressionable voters—Trump enthusiasts on one hand, Democrats dubious about Clinton on the other—who could be encouraged to vote or encouraged not to.","Then the campaign used another Facebook advertising feature built atop that preliminary customization called “Lookalike Audiences.” It targeted another wider circle of Facebook users in the swing constituencies in swing states. Some of this was to keep Trump’s base engaged. Some was to discourage three key columns of Clinton supporters from voting. As Bloomberg noted, “idealistic white liberal, young women and African Americans” were the targets of Trump’s three voter suppression campaigns.","Garcia-Martinez, the original product manager for \"Custom Audiences,” explained how the Trump campaign targeted audiences and then fed it content, often propaganda from other online sources. This explains how Breitbart.com temporarily had more traffic than Fox News in the campaign’s final weeks. But Garcia-Martinez’s explanation also alludes to platform features that are designed to be psychologically engaging and provoke emotional responses. It starts with creating political echo chambers filled with like-minded associates.","“We’ve all contributed to this political balkanization by self-sorting (or being sorted by Facebook) into online tribes that get morphed into filter bubbles, which are then studiously colonized by commercial memes planted and spread there by a combination of Custom and Lookalike Audiences,” he wrote. “One of the ways the Trump campaign leveraged Lookalike Audiences was through its voter suppression campaigns among likely Clinton voters. They seeded the Audiences assembly line with content about Clinton that was engaging but dispiriting. This is one of the ways that Trump won the election, by the very tools that were originally built to help companies like Bed Bath & Beyond sell you towels.”","Colin Delany, the online media consultant and author on the topic, is quick to point out that it’s impossible to trace how all this messaging affected voters’ behavior when they cast their 2016 ballots. That’s because the thread Parscale could observe—whether messaging recipients liked, commented on or shared his handiwork—was broken as voters put down their devices and picked up ballots.","But Delany said there was another metric that confirmed how powerful and engaging Facebook was before 2016’s Election Day. It helped raise a fortune for Trump.","“Now one of the main things with Facebook is this is one of the few operations that I’ve heard of that’s been able to raise a significant amount of money by targeting people on Facebook,” he said. “Now my suspicion is that almost all the money actually got raised by email. But they would identify and recruit the people via Facebook.”","“If you can get them to respond to the first fundraising pitch and give you $5, then you are in their email program. Or you get them to sign a petition. You get them to do whatever it is that gets them the email address,” Delany said. “The small donor lists that the RNC is using to pretty good effect right now comes out of the work that Parscale did for Trump. If you want to look for results, I think you can look to social media fundraising.”","Seen from that metric, there’s no denying the political power of social media. With 10 days to go before Election Day, Bloomberg reported that Parscale’s operation raised $275 million from 2.5 million small donors. That’s more than the nearly $238 million raised by the Sanders presidential campaign from his grassroots base. Think about that: Parscale’s operation outraised Bernie’s operation—but Parscale isn’t bragging about it.","The Clinton campaign, as many political insiders and former Facebook executives have said, didn’t use Facebook as aggressively. In one intriguing series of recent tweets, these tech and political insiders said that Democrats in general rely more on TV ads than online messaging, partly because political consultants can earn more that way. They also said her campaign was relying on dated internal assessments by Facebook (from 2010) about its effects on voter participation, and that overall, its campaigns discounted—and didn’t sufficiently study—“observational political science,” or how voters responded to social media provocations in focus groups.","These cringe-worthy observations are part and parcel of political campaigns, which are like startups that rapidly pop up and then mostly disappear after Election Day. Political campaigns are perpetually in search of messaging and fundraising infrastructure they can use; just as institutions like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have created infrastructure seeking new users. Garcia-Martinez, reached by email, said he was stunned by how little political professionals—and academics who study politics—know about advertising.","“My recent [Wired] piece tossed me into a few threads with political/election/academic Twitter, and I found it a very strange world,” he wrote. “Very punctiliously following strict experimental protocols and the scientific method, and also not knowing the first f**king thing about how to advertise on Facebook (their studies measure what they can as outsiders, which isn't much). It is a leap of faith to just assume Facebook ads work for politics.... but without question, they work for more commercial direct-response advertisers.”","His takeaway: “Parscale is hailed as this genius, but all he did is what any reasonably savvy ecommerce operation would have done, and that set him way beyond Hillary and the supposedly ‘best and brightest.’ Which is why, as Delany and Graves, campaign media consultants and columnists, said, social media will be at the center of 2018’s elections for control of Congress and constitutional offices in swing states.","Don't let big tech control what news you see.

That equated to more than $36 billion in market value lost as lawmakers erupted in fury over the latest scandal involving the company’s role in the contentious 2016 U.S. presidential election as well as the U.K.’s Brexit vote months earlier.","Facebook was under intense scrutiny already. Revelations that user data found its way to a third-party analytics firm that was using the information for political purposes sparked a fresh round of criticism. European Union officials have promised a probe, while several U.S. politicians are calling for the same. The company says it already has suspended Cambridge Analytica, the firm in question, over the issue.","About 1.4 billion people log into Facebook on a daily basis, and the company has reliably grown that number by double-digit rates every year since it went public in 2011. That impressive expansion has allowed Facebook to quickly build up an advertising business now generating $40 billion a year in revenue.","But that business is based on trust—specifically trust from users that their private information won’t be used for malicious purposes. The swirling controversies around the social network’s role in election campaigns and public discourse cuts to the core of Facebook’s value proposition—particularly if it causes users to curb their activity on the network. But Facebook’s immense scale also has made it virtually impossible for alternatives to catch on. That, in turn, makes abuse of the platform more urgent for lawmakers.","How precisely they may do that remains unknown, which is why political risk is difficult for investors to model. Facebook’s current multiple of just under 24 times forward earnings is near a record low and could appear tempting to those drawn to the company’s strong growth and enviable profit margins. The stock now even trades at a slight discount to\nMicrosoft,\na one-time tech juggernaut that dominated a previous era with its own long history of tangles with lawmakers.","But consider that Microsoft also carried a similar multiple in 2003, when the European Union issued its first big fine against company, alleging anticompetitive behavior. Microsoft’s valuation then collapsed by nearly 30% over the next four years as the company’s battle with regulators intensified, even though its business grew about 60% during that same time. A similar drop for Facebook might look unlikely at this stage, but it can’t be written off. Broken friendships don’t mend overnight."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

The idea, in theory, would let Snapchat users grant outside companies access to their Snapchat data to help personalize other services.","Mashable saw a beta version of Snapchat with a new section called “Connected Apps,” with text that reads, “These apps are connected to your Snapchat account. Choose an app to control what it has access to.”","Snapchat currently has an advertising API so people can buy ads through third-party dashboards, but it doesn’t let people use their Snapchat account on other apps, or help people connect with their Snapchat friends on other platforms.","Facebook does, and has for years. An old version of that API, which allowed outside developers to collect data from users without their consent, is at the center of the company’s entire Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The fact that Snapchat is considering sharing some data with outsiders is interesting in general, but particularly interesting given the recent news about Facebook.","There are a lot more questions than answers about the potential product. For example, what would connecting your Snapchat account to another app actually grant that developer? Would they have access to your contact list or private Snap messages? Would Snapchat let you post back to your account from other services?","A Snap spokesperson declined to comment, and the company is likely thinking a lot about those very questions, given the current climate around privacy sharing. Hopefully, Snapchat will learn from Facebook‘s mistakes whenever it decides to roll this out.","Until now, Snap has stayed pretty far out of the spotlight when it comes to data collection and user privacy, probably because so many of the interactions on Snap are in private messages.

{"originalurl":"https://www.cnn.com/2012/08/23/tech/web/big-data-acxiom/index.html","title":"Why big companies buy, sell your data - CNN","text":["They know your name, your phone number, where you live, your buying habits and, in many cases, what you are interested in buying -- sometimes even before you do.","Meet Acxiom, sometimes described as \"the biggest company you've never heard of.\" But they've heard a lot about you.","Acxiom is one of the largest data-brokering firms in the world. It is just one of hundreds of companies who are peering into your personal life, collecting data that is generated from everything you do online, and much of what you do in the real world.","The company recorded $1.1 billion in sales last year offering \"analytical services\" on 144 million households. And that's just a fraction of the evolving -- some say loosely regulated -- big-data industry. Data is now a $300 billion-a-year industry and employs 3 million people in the United States alone, according to the McKinsey Global Institute.","Acxiom Chief Executive Officer Scott Howe agreed to speak with CNN in his first television interview since taking the top job at the company a year ago. The former Microsoft executive wants to \"demystify\" what companies like Acxiom do and how they collect information.","\"Companies like Acxiom are trying to get intelligent about what you might be interested in and who you are. Such that we can deliver more relevant advertising to you, and we can deliver offers and products and services in which you might have interest,\" Howe told CNN. \"All the information we collect and utilize is secure, appropriate, and legal.\"","Howe said Acxiom's clients range from small businesses to large Fortune 500 companies. He envisions \"Big Data\" companies helping consumers by helping to eliminate the spam that clogs our inboxes and the ads that clutter websites.","\"I don't think there is a person in the world who wouldn't agree that data generates tremendous value for both people and for businesses,\" he said. Howe said he believes his company's marketing platform has a dramatic impact on the economy, both for consumers and for businesses.","\"I get access to free content, relevant offers. Advertising is more like education, all useful and relevant,\" Howe said. He said this detailed marketing information is critical in breathing success into business.","\"We collect things like contact information, demographics and your preferences on things. And we'll aggregate that information to try to discern a picture of what people want,\" Howe explains.","Critics of data-brokering companies say that the average consumer has no idea that their intimate personal details are up for sale on these sites. They argue that having this information one click away could be a privacy risk.","\"The other side of the coin is that important decisions are being made about you, the real you, based on the virtual 'you' that's made up of all this data,\" said Sarah Downey, a privacy analyst with Abine.com, an online-privacy company based in Boston. \"Decisions like your credit score, your insurance rates, or even if you get a job. And these things are serious, they have serious import in people's lives and sometimes they are wrong.\"","There are hundreds of companies specializing in collecting marketing data and creating profiles of millions of consumers across the country. But unlike the national Do Not Call List, which gives consumers a one-stop location to have their telephone numbers removed from telemarketing databases, data marketing does not have a universal opt-out system.","Abine.com created a subscription service called \"Delete Me\" that removes people's information from the web. For $99 per year, they will coordinate to remove all of your information from data-broker sites. It's a tremendous amount of work because each data broker site has a different procedure to remove personal information: phone calls, e-mails, faxes, and/or certified letters. And many times these companies require users to submit more personal information just to opt out.","Don Jackson, a security researcher for Dell SecureWorks, warns that data mining could open the door to hacking, identity theft and stalking.","\"I don't think anybody is being intentionally malicious, but from a security standpoint you want to know how the data is being used, Jackson said. \"That information becomes powerful at that point, and it can be misused. We have seen cases where just basic information, just very few pieces from social networks, can lead predators to potential victims, for example. That's a common scenario, actually.\"","Currently, there is no comprehensive federal regulation for data brokers. Last March, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report on protecting consumer privacy in which they recommended that Congress consider legislation overseeing online privacy, data security and breach notification, and data brokers.","President Barack Obama has said updates to U.S. laws are urgently needed to keep pace with the many threats that Americans face in cyberspace. But the Senate's most recent cybersecurity legislation stalled this summer on a procedural vote.","Howe says Acxiom supports effective regulation, and that his was the first data-brokering company to employ a chief privacy officer. But \"if regulation has unintended consequences, it can be really damaging to our economy,\" he said.","Clearly, the collection of big data is raising big questions. And even though Acxiom knows a lot about you, Howe isn't convinced you need to know a lot about them.","\"Do people need to know who Acxiom is? I don't know. I withdrew money from the ATM this morning and I didn't know who made the ATM. But that didn't mean that I didn't trust I wasn't going to get my money,\" he said. \"I think people are far more concerned with, 'does this generate value for them?'","\"Is the world a better place due to data? I can't see there being any debate about the fact that data is good.\""],"isopubdate":"2012-08-23"}
