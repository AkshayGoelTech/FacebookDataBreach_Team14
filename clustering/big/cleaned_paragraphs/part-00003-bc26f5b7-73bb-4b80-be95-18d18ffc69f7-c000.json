About 270,000 people downloaded the app and gave Kogan access to their data, like city and content they had liked. That information should have remained with Kogan, but he instead gave it SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie. They used it to build profiles on potential voters for use in political campaigns.","The operation was not limited to 270,000 people, though. Kogan's app also provided access to \"more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it,\" Grewal wrote— aka friends of friends—which allowed Cambridge to build profiles for millions of potential voters.","Ultimately, the New York Times reports, Kogan provided Cambridge with \"50 million raw profiles,\" of which \"roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records\" and build what Cambridge called \"psychographic profiles.\"","This data collection started in 2014 and Facebook was made aware of it in 2015. At that point, \"we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed,\" Grewal wrote. \"Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.\"","They had not. According to the Times, \"a former [Cambridge] employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.\"","Grewal said Facebook was told the data had not been deleted \"several days ago, [and] we are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.\" The Times said it sent questions to Facebook about the data for a week, but \"Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control.\"","In a Saturday statement, Cambridge Analytica said it \"deleted all data\" received from Kogan when it \"became clear that the data had not been obtained...in line with Facebook's terms of service.\"","Wylie left Cambridge in late 2014 and has since become a rather outspoken critic of the firm's tactics.","How did the Trump campaign come into play? As the Times reports, billionaire Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, starting with $1.5 million for the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial race. That didn't pan out; Democrat Terry McAuliffe won. But Mercer and other high-profile GOP donors had their eyes on a bigger prize—Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential bid.","But creating voter profiles is expensive, so Cambridge turned to Kogan and his Facebook app for data collection. Their efforts on the Cruz campaign were reported by The Guardian in late 2015, which is when Facebook found out and demanded that the data be destroyed. It was not, and when Cruz failed to secure the GOP presidential nomination, Cambridge turned its attention to the Trump campaign.","As Jared Kushner told Forbes in late 2016, \"We found that Facebook and digital targeting were the most effective ways to reach the audiences. The campaign \"brought in Cambridge Analytica,\" Kushner said, which worked with Brad Parscale, the campaign's digital lead. Parscale was recently selected to lead President's Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.","Cambridge Analytica denies using any of the offending Facebook material for Trump's campaign. \"No data from [Kogan] was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" it said Saturday. \"Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations.\"","UPDATE 3/19: Facebook said Monday it hired Stroz Friedberg to audit the Cambridge servers and systems to see if its data was actually deleted. Kogan also agreed to an an audit, according to Facebook, but Wylie has not.","\"We also want to be clear that today when developers create apps that ask for certain information from people, we conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data, Facebook said. \"We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process. Kogan's app would not be permitted access to detailed friends' data today.\"","Related","However, the audit was abruptly put on hold so that the UK's Information Commissioner's Office could get to the site first to conduct their own investigation, Facebook said in an updated post.","The Cambridge controversy has caught the attention of Capitol Hill. Sen. Ron Wyden has asked Mark Zuckerberg for detailed information on what happened in this case, while Sens. Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar said the incident is a clear example of why their proposed Honest Ads Act, introduced with Republican John McCain, is necessary.","About the Author","Before joining PCMag.com, Chloe covered financial IT for Incisive Media in NYC and technology policy for The National Journal's Technology Daily in Washington, DC.

Here Molly unpicks a tangled web.","The allegations fall under three main headings:","Theft of data from Facebook to enable creation of individual voter profiles","Micro-targeting with fear-based messages and military-informed psyops","Breach of spending limits","Data breach and identity theft","Facebook allowed Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan to use a personality questionnaire delivered via an app to harvest personal data of 50 million Facebook users. He claimed it was for research use only but passed the data onto Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook discovered the breach in 2015 they failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who worked with Kogan to obtain the data, explains how Cambridge Analytica used this information to build profiles and algorithms for social media micro-targeting, designing messages specifically to respond to voters ‘inner demons’.","The use of psychologically driven propaganda","Expertise in psychographics – the use of personal data to enable micro-targeting of messages – is the main selling point of Cambridge Analytica, a subsidiary of SCL Elections (formerly known as Strategic Communications Laboratories). This company has a disturbing track-record of being employed to undertake brainwashing (more technically known as Psyops) for the military and security services and undermine free and fair elections in a number of countries. It has also emerged that the UK government has had six contracts in the past with the SCL Group.","Breach of spending limits required by electoral law","In the lead-up to the Brexit refrendum, the law limited spending by the official campaign on each side to £7m. Other independent campaigns could spend up to £700,000. Campaigns had to keep funding separate and were legally prohibited from cooperating over strategy or tactics or sharing personnel.","Before these recent revelations we knew that these two companies were closely linked through their history, their personnel and through ownership of their Intellectual Property by the Canadian hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer. The smoking gun though, confirming the close relationship, is a shared Google drive. Victoria Woodcock, the operations director for Vote Leave, deleted herself, campaign director Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave’s digital director, Henry de Zoete, from dozens of files on the drive Vote Leave shared with BeLeave to hide the fact of co-ordination following the launch of an investigation by the Electoral Commission.","The links between Vote Leave and BeLeave as revealed by whistleblower Shahmir Sanni demonstrate prime facie evidence of illegal activity. In total, AggregateIQ received £3.9m by Leave campaigners, a full 10% of all the money spent by both sides. It is a very small company working out of a tiny office in Victoria, Canada. Christopher Wylie, who helped set up both Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, explains that the connection to Cambridge Analytica was a personal one – he is also from Victoria – and the company had no online presence when it began working for the Vote Leave campaign.","This scandal goes to the highest levels of government, as cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Boris Johnson fronted the Vote Leave campaign.","So, in summary, Vote Leave spent more than 40% of its official campaign budget on the activity of AggregateIQ, whose services were also used by BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist Party. In addition, AIQ has ties to SCL Elections and CA, whose expertise is in distorting electoral processes. There is also strong evidence that spending limits were broken. This suggests that the narrow victory for the Leave side is not robust and greatly strengthens our case for a people’s poll on the final deal.","You can find out more about which cookies we are using or switch them off in settings.","Privacy Overview","This website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.

Facebook has been peeking at smartphone users’ phone call and SMS text data.","Facebook has been facing extra scrutiny since former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie blew the whistle on the firm in mid-March. Cambridge Analytica utilized Facebook user data to sway voters in the 2016 presidential election. According to Facebook, this wasn’t a data breach, since users consented to giving their information away. Nonetheless, it was enough to launch an Federal Trade Commission investigation into Facebook.","So what else have you unknowingly consented to give to Facebook? Information about who you’ve been calling and texting, possibly.","On Wednesday, Dylan McKay posted on Twitter saying that he noticed some weird data in his Facebook archive — the ZIP file backup of his entire profile that Facebook lets its users download. In addition to the usual photos and status updates, he noticed timestamped call logs and data on who he was texting. On Android, Messenger lets you set it as your default texting app, so that all SMS messages are sent using Facebook’s app. But McKay claims he never did so.","How to tell if Facebook’s been looking at your call and text data","Facebook has released a blog post addressing this issue. Like before, the company claims it only has this information about users who explicitly gave their consent. If you’ve ever allowed Facebook access to your contact book, this could mean you. Facebook asks for access to your entire list of contacts in this setup screen that comes up when you first download the app.","IPhone users are not affected by this (as far as we know), but those using the Messenger app on Android could definitely be afflicted.","If you’ve ever allowed Facebook access to your contacts or made the app your default mode of texting, you may find similar info in your Facebook archive. If you’re computer savvy, you can make use of McKay’s script to see all the info Facebook has on you. If you use Messenger but want to cut off the company’s access to these things, head to the Settings app on your Android device, go to Apps and Permissions and find the Messenger app. Tap Permissions and you’ll be able to toggle on and off exactly what the app can see.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale.

From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

You’ll get a file with every photo and comment you’ve posted, all the ads you’ve clicked on, stuff you’ve liked and searched for and everyone you’ve friended — and unfriended — over the years.","This trove of data is used to decide which ads to show you. It also makes using Facebook more seamless and enjoyable — say, by determining which posts to emphasize in your feed, or reminding you of friends’ birthdays.","Facebook claims to protect all this information, and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that’s relatively clear and concise. But few users bother to read it. You might be surprised at what Facebook’s privacy policy allows — and what’s left unsaid.","Facebook’s privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users. While past privacy debacles have centered on what marketers gather on users, the stakes are higher this time because the firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society.","Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it’s adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users. Thanks largely to years of privacy scandals and pressure from users and regulators, Facebook also offers a complex set of controls that let users limit how their information is used — to a point.","You can turn off ad targeting and see generic ads instead, the way you would on television or in a newspaper. In the ad settings, you’d need to uncheck all your interests, interactions with companies and websites and other personal information you don’t want to use in targeting. Of course, if you click on a new interest after this, you’ll have to go back and uncheck it in your ad preferences to prevent targeting. It’s a tedious task.","As Facebook explains, it puts you in target categories based on your activity. So, if you are 35, live in Seattle and have liked an outdoor adventure page, Facebook may show you an ad for a mountain bike shop in your area.","But activity isn’t limited to pages or posts you like, comments you make and your use of outside apps and websites.","“If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those and analyzes them too,” Zeynep Tufekci, a prominent techno-sociologist, said in a 2017 TED talk .","And, increasingly, Facebook tries to match what it knows about you with your offline data, purchased from data brokers or gathered in other ways. The more information it has, the fuller the picture of you it can offer to advertisers. It can infer things about you that you had no intention of sharing — anything from your ethnicity to personality traits, happiness and use of addictive substances, Tufekci said.","These types of data collection aren’t necessarily explicit in privacy policies or settings.","What Facebook does say is that advertisers don’t get the raw data. They just tell Facebook what kind of people they want their ads to reach, then Facebook makes the matches and shows the ads.","Apps can also collect a lot of data about you, as revealed in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The firm got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million.","Facebook says Cambridge Analytica got the data inappropriately — but only because the app said it collected data for research rather than political profiling. Gathering data on friends was permitted at the time, even if they had never installed the app or given explicit consent.","Ian Bogost, a Georgia Tech communications professor who built a tongue-in-cheek game called “Cow Clicker” in 2010, wrote in The Atlantic recently that abusing the Facebook platform for “deliberately nefarious ends” was easy to do then. What’s worse, he said, it was hard to avoid extracting private data.","If “you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior,” he wrote. “I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood.”","Facebook has since restricted the amount of types of data apps can access. But other types of data collection are still permitted. For this reason, it’s a good idea to check all the apps you’ve given permissions to over the years. You can also do this in your settings.","Left:\nFacebook announced new transparency rules last year for political ads. File photo/Dado Ruvic/Illustration"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-25"}

An onslaught of negative reactions ensued both from many people and the press due to deep-seated concerns Facebook doesn’t care about digital privacy and rather profit off knowing as much about users — like their tendencies and traits — as possible.","“I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,” Cook said during a forum in Beijing over the weekend, according to Bloomberg. “The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life — from my own point of view, it shouldn’t exist.”","If they wanted to, Apple could make plenty of money by monetizing the customer, Cook said Wednesday with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and Swisher.","Cook and Apple, however, are sometimes recipients of other forms of criticism.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Facebook’s handling of user data has been called into question in the aftermath of the leak, which has prompted calls for further regulation of internet firms and the protection of consumer information on the internet.","In addition, the hashtag #deletefacebook has been trending for over a week as more and more people consider leaving the platform.","Facebook’s stock took a nose dive as the story unfolded, which only accelerated as country after country launched investigations into Facebook’s data-handling practices. Both Canada and the United States have launched federal investigations into these practices.","The company’s market capitalization is currently just over US$440 billion. That’s down nearly US$100 billion from US$538 billion on March 16.","“The fundamental problem for Facebook is that these privacy issues that have been highlighted have compelled regulators to take a closer look,” said Lisa Kramer, a professor in the department of management at the University of Toronto.","She went on to explain that if the practices that allowed Facebook to essentially collect user information and sell it to advertisers are banned or reigned in, it could significantly impact the company’s bottom line.","Furthermore, if users continue to delete their Facebook accounts, advertising revenue will decline.","“Users are being alerted to the use of information that they weren’t aware of. Many are beginning to delete their accounts,” said Kramer. “Fewer eyeballs to advertise to spells trouble for advertising revenue.”","While Soberman doesn’t believe that the scandal is enough to sink what’s become one of the world’s most profitable companies, he acknowledges that regulating the practices that allowed Facebook to rake in astronomical profits from advertising could pose some long-term obstacles.","“What you’ve got on the internet is a network that doesn’t have boundaries. It’s kind of unregulated,” said Soberman. “It won’t be able to maintain its current level of profitability because it won’t be able to do some of the things it has been doing,” he concluded.","While we wait to see what impact these events will have on Facebook’s bottom line, Kramer warns that the low stock price doesn’t mean it’s the right time to invest, as the stock price is likely to continue going down before it comes back up.","“The typical investor should not invest more in Facebook than they can afford to lose,” at least for right now, said Kramer.","Facebook’s stock was trading on the NASDAQ exchange at just over US$185 on March 16 when it started to fall. Today it’s around US$152, a drop of more than 15 per cent. That said, the stock is up about eight per cent from a year ago, when it was trading around US$140."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Today, Facebook’s founder is fighting to show that he is capable of leading the world’s eighth-biggest listed company or that any of its 2.1bn users should trust it.","News that Cambridge Analytica (CA), a firm linked to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, got data on 50m Facebook users in dubious, possibly illegal, ways has lit a firestorm (see article). Mr Zuckerberg took five days to reply and, when he did, he conceded that Facebook had let its users down in the past but seemed not to have grasped that its business faces a wider crisis of confidence. After months of talk about propaganda and fake news, politicians in Europe and, increasingly, America see Facebook as out of control and in denial. Congress wants him to testify. Expect a roasting.","Since the news, spooked investors have wiped 9% off Facebook’s shares. Consumers are belatedly waking up to the dangers of handing over data to tech giants that are run like black boxes. Already, according to the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank, a majority of Americans say they distrust social-media firms. Mr Zuckerberg and his industry need to change, fast.","The addiction game","Facebook’s business relies on three elements: keeping users glued to their screens, collecting data about their behaviour and convincing advertisers to pay billions of dollars to reach them with targeted ads. The firm has an incentive to promote material that grabs attention and to sell ads to anyone. Its culture melds a ruthless pursuit of profit with a Panglossian and narcissistic belief in its own virtue. Mr Zuckerberg controls the firm’s voting rights. Clearly, he gets too little criticism.","In the latest fiasco, it emerged that in 2013 an academic in Britain built a questionnaire app for Facebook users, which 270,000 people answered. They in turn had 50m Facebook friends. Data on all these people then ended up with CA. (Full disclosure: The Economist once used CA for a market-research project.) Facebook says that it could not happen again and that the academic and CA broke its rules; both deny doing anything wrong. Regulators in Europe and America are investigating. Facebook knew of the problem in 2015, but it did not alert individual users. Although nobody knows how much CA benefited Mr Trump’s campaign, the fuss has been amplified by the left’s disbelief that he could have won the election fairly.","But that does not give Facebook a defence. The episode fits an established pattern of sloppiness towards privacy, tolerance of inaccuracy and reluctance to admit mistakes. In early 2017 Mr Zuckerberg dismissed the idea that fake news had influenced the election as “pretty crazy”. In September Facebook said Kremlin-linked firms had spent a mere $100,000 to buy 3,000 adverts on its platform, failing at first to mention that 150m users had seen free posts by Russian operatives. It has also repeatedly misled advertisers about its user statistics.","Facebook is not about to be banned or put out of business, but the chances of a regulatory backlash are growing. Europe is inflicting punishment by a thousand cuts, from digital taxes to antitrust cases. And distrustful users are switching off. The American customer base of Facebook’s core social network has stagnated since June 2017. Its share of America’s digital advertising market is forecast to dip this year for the first time. The network effect that made Facebook ever more attractive to new members as it grew could work in reverse if it starts to shrink. Facebook is worth $493bn, but only has $14bn of physical assets. Its value is intangible—and, potentially, ephemeral.","If Mr Zuckerberg wants to do right by the public and his firm, he must rebuild trust. So far he has promised to audit some apps, restrict developers’ access to data still further, and help people control which apps have access to their data.","That doesn’t go nearly far enough. Facebook needs a full, independent examination of its approach to content, privacy and data, including its role in the 2016 election and the Brexit referendum. This should be made public. Each year Facebook should publish a report on its conduct that sets out everything from the prevalence of fake news to privacy breaches.","Next, Facebook and other tech firms need to open up to outsiders, safely and methodically. They should create an industry ombudsman—call it the Data Rights Board. Part of its job would be to set and enforce the rules by which accredited independent researchers look inside platforms without threatening users’ privacy. Software is being developed with this in mind (see article). The likes of Facebook raise big questions. How does micro-targeting skew political campaigns? What biases infect facial-recognition algorithms? Better they be answered with evidence instead of outrage.","The board or something like it could also act as a referee for complaints, and police voluntary data-protection protocols. Facebook, for example, is planning to comply worldwide with some of the measures contained in a new European law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. Among other things, this will give users more power to opt out of being tracked online and to stop their information being shared with third parties. Adherence to such rules needs to be closely monitored.","Thumbs down","Tech has experience of acting collectively to solve problems. Standards on hardware and software, and the naming of internet domains, are agreed on jointly. Facebook’s rivals may be wary but, if the industry does not come up with a joint solution, a government clampdown will become inevitable.","Facebook seems to think it only needs to tweak its approach. In fact it, and other firms that hoover up consumer data, should assume that their entire business model is at risk. As users become better informed, the alchemy of taking their data without paying and manipulating them for profit may die. Firms may need to compensate people for their data or let them pay to use platforms ad-free. Profits won’t come as easily, but the alternative is stark. If Facebook ends up as a regulated utility with its returns on capital capped, its earnings may drop by 80%. How would you like that, Mr Zuckerberg?","This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \"Epic fail\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

This is the first article in Technology Radar Echoes, a new series where authors share their insights and experience on the technology problems and solutions driving business differentiation for enterprise leaders. Now in its sixth year, the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar is an assessment of trends significantly impacting software development and business strategy created by an international advisory board of technologists.","Not too many years ago, before social media, mobility, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud, and big data muddied the field, technology stacks (the different layers of technology required to implement an application) were simpler and often vendor-specific. A good example is the Microsoft stack: .NET languages for programming, IIS as a web and application server, and the SQL Server database.","Today, technology stacks have exploded. We have platforms such as Microsoft Nano Server, Deis, Fastly, Apache Spark and Kubernetes. New tools pop up every week including Docker Toolbox, Gitrob, Polly, Prometheus and Sleepy Puppy. Programming languages and new frameworks such as Nancy, Axon, Frege, and Traveling Ruby are introduced. Advanced techniques such as the Data Lake, Gitflow, Flux and NoPSD mature. This list goes on and on.","On every ThoughtWorks Technology Radar we include approximately 120 items and cull almost as many for lack of space. In the past five years we have seriously considered more than 2,000 tech “blips” for the radar. While a small subset of recommended technologies would apply to a given application, technology stacks varieties exhibit exponential growth in the last five or so years.","So why would you, an executive or manager, care? Why would you as a CEO care? Isn’t this the job of the technologists to manage? No! If software and software development are keys to your digital future, then you should care—not about the details, but what the overall trend means to your organization.","Technology, in many forms, drives differentiation and disruption—executives and managers must understand the implications of that technology landscape to make relevant decisions.","Implications:","The technology landscape exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium. As new technologies and approaches appear, the ecosystem adopts them to create a new equilibrium.","Here are some recent landscape shifts:","Single vendor solutions are a thing of the past","In the recent past, even some large organizations maintained a single-vendor solution to their tech stack. In the mid-2000s a friend of Jim’s worked on a data warehouse project for a company that was completely an IBM shop. For their data warehouse project the client insisted on an IBM tech stack (data warehouse) on aging AS/400 hardware. The team tried to convince the client that in this case a Microsoft stack would be much more effective. After missing deadline after deadline using the IBM hardware and tech stack, building a prototype using the Microsoft stack on Windows servers, and meeting after meeting, the development team finally convinced management to change the tech stack. Progress improved dramatically. The company’s single-vendor solution had failed as they moved into a new application area.","That’s a trend that’s growing in momentum. There’s so much happening, so quickly, that even a company the size of Microsoft or Oracle can’t keep up any more. Not just is the volume of change too fast, we also see that many of these changes are disruptive, thus causing existing products to be obsolete—and it’s hard for any company to walk away from what has been their jewels.","The rise of open-source tools further fuels this. Open-source products facilitate deeper collaborations across companies, allowing a vendor to build new tools on top of a dozen other technologies without having to agree to multiple licenses. This encourages smaller, more focused companies, who can specialize in a single technology area. There’s little incentive now for large technology corporations to consolidate except, and here’s a killer irony, when the technology is dying out.","One mantra of efficiency-driven managers has been standardization, standardization, standardization. In today’s world standardization may be a direct path to calcification.","Mobile development means dealing with multiple operating system vendors for different devices. Big data development means dealing with different types of database management systems, many that are either open-source or from newer vendors with short track records; the days of a single data solution have ended.","If you want to be a digital enterprise, increasing tech stack complexity means increasing vendor complexity—with all its associated headaches, and opportunities.","Team composition and organizational structures need to change","As tech stack complexity grows, organizing your teams based on technology layers becomes less and less effective. In the early Internet era of only a few tech layers—business logic, database, middleware, presentation layer—teams organized around technology layers weren’t pretty, but they worked to some degree. Today, those degrees are shrinking to zero. The wide diversity of skills required to build today’s applications means collaborative teamwork, not dysfunctional silos. There are fewer and fewer instances in which one or two people have all the requisite skills to design, build, and deploy an application. Furthermore, as team sizes get larger to acquire the skills required, diverse teams have to collaborate more closely to be successful.","In the past, operating cost and complexity encouraged companies to create technical silos such as developers, QA, and operations; but Cloud and a focus on DevOps culture give us the ability to provision machines automatically and deliver new product features daily. These capabilities give us a new architectural opportunity. Rather than partition your architecture in technical layers, teams increasingly organize around domain concepts like Customer or Order, encapsulating the technical layers within a service. This trend towards domain (or product) organizations rather than technical layer organizations is accelerating as companies go digital. If companies continue to organize along technical silo lines, the number of siloed functions with their necessary interactions will increase dramatically causing more severe integration problems.","Collaborative teams become an absolute necessity","As teams become more complex, collaboration becomes more critical. As noted above, today’s teams require a wider range of skills, from pure tech stack layer expertise through to operations, product design and product management. This diversity makes it both harder to collaborate effectively and more necessary. One of the benefits of the agile and lean movements has been to encourage the empowered, collaborative, cross-functional teams.","Building software delivery capabilities just got much more difficult","Engineering matters. More and more companies are realizing that their digital strategies remain fallow without world-class software delivery capabilities.","“As digital technologies relentlessly reshape competition, products and services increasingly depend on software for differentiation and performance. Despite the mission-critical nature of software, it gets surprisingly little attention in the C-suite. New research suggests, however, that companies pay a price when they undervalue the strategic importance of producing excellent software.” [“The perils of ignoring software development,” McKinsey Quarterly, 2015]","There are five key factors that impact an organization’s ability to build a world-class software delivery capability: breadth of skills, depth of skills, quick learning, innovation, and decision-making.","The breadth of skills required to build applications today has increased dramatically as tech stacks become more complex. To keep up, you may need to develop Internet of Things (IoT) skills as well as software delivery skills.","But not only has the breadth of skills increased, but the depth of skill required (advanced versus basic) has increased also. Cutting-edge applications require cutting-edge skills. Just as a 5.10 (difficulty level) rock climber doesn’t have a chance of ascending a 5.13 route, an average skilled software team has little chance of delivering a gnarly software application.","As we have seen with the tech stack’s rapid pace of change, the skills and knowledge required tomorrow will be different, meaning that not only do you need people who have today’s skills but people who can quickly acquire tomorrow’s.","Building a culture to adapt and learn is as important as building specific technical skills.","In a long-quoted observation, a manager laments that he’s reluctant to send developers to training because he’s afraid they’ll leave for another company, and the reply is: “What if you don’t train them and they stay?”","On top of the technical skills themselves, individuals need to apply those skills in innovative ways. There needs to be a sense of adventure and exploration in your organizational culture.","Finally, but not least important, your organization needs better decision-making around capabilities and skills. You need to decide questions such as: What skills you need? Do you need to build each skill internally? What depth do you need in each skill set? How do you balance formal training versus experiential skill acquisition methods? How do you keep your skills updated? Do you build skills internally, or buy (or borrow) external resources?","Outsourcing versus in-sourcing versus co-sourcing options are more complicated and no longer cost-driven","Many organizations are finding that they just can’t build and maintain the technology and software delivery capabilities required today. Some can’t attract the required talent because today’s best developers are in high demand and want to live in global “tier one” cities such as New York or London, while many corporate IT departments are in lower cost, less glamorous locations. Some can’t afford the talent on an ongoing basis because they don’t have a continuous pipeline of digital business projects. During the cost-cutting, efficiency-focused strategies of the prior decade many companies outsourced so much of their capability that rebuilding it to fit today’s needs would take too long and leave them at a competitive disadvantage. Today’s digital business sourcing decisions need to be focused on innovation, delivery cycle time, and value generation—not on cost savings.","Today, outsourcing technology development is not driven by cost reduction but on capability acquisition. Furthermore, you should be looking for partners who not only have the current capability you need, but have demonstrated the ability to build new capabilities rapidly.","While bringing in capability from the outside solves some pressing opportunities, it also carries the same problems as cost-based outsourcing, only the problems are magnified. For example, outsourcing always carries potential knowledge transfer problems if you ever want to bring the outsourced applications back in-house. Tech stack complexity magnifies those knowledge transfer problems. Increasing the number of vendors and new types of contracts adds additional challenges. For example, contracting can be more difficult as developing cost-control oriented contracts are better understood than innovation-centric, value-oriented contracts.","Building a cutting-edge technology organization is costly","We hear from clients that they are afraid to adopt modern technology stacks (e.g. Hadoop) because they don't think their people can up-skill sufficiently. At the same time they want to attract new young talent and know they have to adopt modern technologies that excite them. This paradox cannot be resolved by the technology organization—it requires business executive leadership.","There is no way around it, if you want to build a digital savvy enterprise, you can’t do it with a cost-cutting mentality. With the complexity of the tech stack, the need to innovate at the technology, business model, and product levels, and the war for talent—undertaking a strategy to build a cutting-edge technology organization should not be made lightly. The decision to move forward on this front must be made from an overall business strategy (building an entrepreneurial company, creating a digital business) and a focus on value, not cost. Cost is important as a constraint, not as an objective.","Technology change can be overwhelming, but you have to keep up to keep ahead","Software engineering matters—not just to technologists, but to business executives also.","The bottom line is that technology changes are prescribing other changes in your business, changes that will have a long-term impact on business viability. In recent years, the complexity of the technology stack required for digital business applications has soared leaving businesses on the horns of a dilemma. On one hand there is the necessity of meeting the digital business challenge and on the other is the unanticipated difficulty in building the technology skills required to meet that challenge. As the pace of change of technology accelerates, tech strategy must inform your business strategy. The only meaningful way to do that is to foster an organization that can assess, adopt and adapt to new technology.","About ThoughtWorks","We are a software company and a community of passionate, purpose-led individuals.

Brad Parscale tells Lesley Stahl how he fine-tuned political ads posted on Facebook to directly reach voters with the exact messages they cared most about – infrastructure key among them -- and had handpicked Republican Facebook employees to guide him. Stahl's report will be broadcast on 60 Minutes Sunday, Oct. 8 at 7 p.m. ET/PT.","Brad Parscale","CBS News","\"Twitter is how [Trump] talked to the people, Facebook was going to be how he won,\" Parscale tells Stahl. Parscale says he used the majority of his digital ad budget on Facebook ads and explained how efficient they could be, particularly in reaching the rural vote. \"So now Facebook lets you get to…15 people in the Florida Panhandle that I would never buy a TV commercial for,\" says Parscale. And people anywhere could be targeted with the messages they cared about. \"Infrastructure…so I started making ads that showed the bridge crumbling…that's micro targeting…I can find the 1,500 people in one town that care about infrastructure. Now, that might be a voter that normally votes Democrat,\" he says. Parscale says the campaign would average 50-60,000 different ad versions every day, some days peaking at 100,000 separate iterations – changing design, colors, backgrounds and words – all in an effort to refine ads and engage users.","Parscale received help utilizing Facebook's technology from Facebook employees provided by the company who showed up for work to his office multiple days a week. He says they had to be partisan and he questioned them to make sure. \"I wanted people who supported Donald Trump.\" Parscale calls these Facebook employees \"embeds\" who could teach him every aspect of the technology. \"I want to know everything you would tell Hillary's campaign plus some,\" he says he told them.","Both campaigns used Facebook's advertising technology extensively to reach voters, but Parscale says the Clinton campaign didn't go as far as using \"embeds.\" \"I had heard that they did not accept any of [Facebook's] offers.\"","The conservative Parscale sees an irony in all this. \"These social platforms are all invented by very liberal people on the West and East Coast. And we figure out how to use it to push conservative values. I don't think they thought that would ever happen,\" says Parscale."],"isopubdate":""}

Higbie later apologized for his remarks on the radio.","Higbe’s Facebook page previously had stricter privacy settings, but at some point since CNN’s initial report in January, his past postings became viewable.","In a December 18, 2014 post, Higbie shared a post that he claimed was written by an 83-year-old black man. The post uses the N-word, uncensored 20 times.","In sharing the post, Higbie wrote, “these are not the words of me, Carl Higbie but that of Williams [sic] G. Lillas.” He called the man’s thoughts “straight to the point.”","The independent fact-checking website Snopes has said the post, which Higbie attributed to Lillas, a war veteran, had been shared around the Internet in various iterations and is “probably false.”","A CNN search of public records didn’t turn up anyone with that name matching his age and veteran status.","Erin Montgomery, a spokeswoman for America First Policies, told CNN in an email statement that Higbie did not use the N-word in the post and said the original author would have to answer whether he thought the use of the word was racist.","“Carl Higbie’s a hero, who served his country admirably, and you, Messrs. Kaczynski and McDermott, are doing no service to anyone by unfairly targeting someone who has literally taken bullets to protect your First Amendment right to spew falsehoods and propaganda,” Montgomery said.","Higbie did not return a request for comment.","Higbie shared the post when the death of Michael Brown, the teenager who was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, was in the news. The post refers to Brown by the N-word.","“So, let us be clear, Michael Brown was a nigger; a sorry assed, criminal, hoodlum, nigger. Nobody wants to say that, but I will,” the post said.","The post later says black people repeatedly riot and again uses the N-word.","“I have fought communist Chinese and North Korean soldiers in the 1950’s with more honor than that nigger,” it reads. “Yep, I peeled potatoes and shot communists. That’s the only job a nigger soldier could get. Rodney King? Black Riots! Trayvon? Black Riots! Hurricane Katrina? Black Riots! Stealing TV’s, designer clothes, etc. O.J. Simpson kills white man and white woman, found NOT GUILTY? Did white folks riot? Nope! In fact, when is the last time white people rioted? Civil War, maybe? That’s because they are, relatively, civilized people, much like many black Americans.”","The post later says the “militarization” of police is necessary and again uses the N-word. The post also uses the N-word in describing black-on-black murders.","In January, KFile unearthed shocking comments Higbie made on his radio show about black Americans, Muslims, women, LGBT people, veterans suffering from PTSD and immigrants.","After the story published, Higbie resigned from his post as chief of external affairs at the Corporation for National and Community Service and apologized, saying on Twitter, “I’m sorry. I’m not sorry that my words were published, I am sorry that I said them in 2013,” he wrote. “Those words do not reflect who I am or what I stand for, I regret saying them. Last night I informed the WH that I was resigning so as not to distract from POTUS’ many success.”","Higbie also shared content on Facebook that mirrored the racist sentiment he shared on the radio.","In October 2014, he shared a news article about an African man who raped his wife, and then circumcised her. Alongside the article, Higbie suggested that the Ebola virus was “nature’s way of controlling this population.”","In another post in 2014, Higbie shared a link with an image of a black woman that said, “See Obama Voter Can’t Afford Water But Has Money For Manicures, Weaves and Tattos [sic]”. The link led to a video of a woman criticizing a store for charging for water, but the image was an unrelated Associated Press photo of a woman in Detroit who had her water shut off.","In September 2015, he shared an image of two black women standing on the American flag along with a caption that said, “Cancel the welfare checks of anyone who disrespects the US flag.”","Jason Miller, a former senior communications adviser for the Trump campaign, told CNN Friday night that he was upset by the language Higbie reportedly used.","“I’m both disturbed and very concerned that someone who said these comments, these hateful type comments, was then hired by the C4,” he said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.” “This is not how the President talks, this is not how anyone near the President talks and this is exactly the story that the left wants to go and paint of the President and his supporters.”","Get up-to-date all daily #techNews, mobile news, #techreviews, how-tos, auto news, #gaming & #gadgets, #techbusiness, #androidnews, #iOSnews, #cryptocurrencynews #gadgets, #sciencetech in one place.

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

This weekend, Facebook banned the high-profile data firm Cambridge Analytica — paid more than $6 million by President Trump’s 2016 campaign — after a joint New York Times/Guardian probe revealed the improper harvesting of data from an estimated 50 million users of the platform.","Nixon on steroids, indeed. In 1972, the 37th president’s dirty tricksters got caught in the Watergate with some Radio Shack-style gizmos and some badly applied duct tape trying to bug the Democratic Party’s headquarters so they could try to steal the words of one man, party chief Larry O’Brien. That act — and the various cover-ups and sleazy maneuvers that surrounded it — cost Richard Nixon his presidency.","You might have heard this weekend that Facebook — from whom the data was obtained and where much of the ensuing psychological warfare took place in the summer and fall of 2016 — has now banned the firm, Cambridge Analytica. It was not a bold move by Mark Zuckerberg’s social media behemoth but a cowardly one, taken just minutes before some stellar reporting by the Guardian’s Carole Cadwalladr and journalists from the New York Times jointly exposed the hijacking of the data and, arguably, the theft of an American presidential election. Facebook’s too-little-too-late action was the ultimate closing of the barn door after the horse has already bolted — the horse being American democracy.","What CA lacked, however, was the data the pull this off. That’s when what Facebook’s top lawyer has now acknowledged was “a scam — and a fraud” came into play. Wylie — the young political data maven now turned whistleblower — and the team assembled by Mercer and Bannon turned to experts in “psychometrics” at Britain’s Cambridge University; there, a Russian American (heh … a bit more on that later) professor named Aleksandr Kogan was hired for $800,000. Kogan reportedly then lied to Facebook about his real project — a personality quiz and an app that 270,000 people consented to but which allowed the firm to pull Facebook “likes” and other personal info from 50 million unsuspecting Americans. (The company also seems to have lied to Facebook about later destroying the data.)","Indeed, Wylie noted that Cambridge Analytica emerged from a defense contractor called SCL and what it began to market in the mid-2000s was “cyber warfare for elections.” The Mercer-and-Bannon-backed CA was initially hired to work for GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016 — Mercer’s initial horse in the race — but the team had switched by summer 2016 to party nominee Trump, which then paid the firm about $6 million.","What does political cyber warfare look like? As you might imagine, pretty ugly. In an election where most voters’ preferences are deeply rooted, a campaign like the one engineered by Cambridge Analytica tried to tap into the psychology of the voters who could most easily be peeled away from Trump’s opponent Hillary Clinton — young people who might be convinced to vote third-party, or blacks who’d been enthusiastic about Barack Obama but could be discouraged from showing up in 2016. Data seemingly as trivial as what sneakers or candy bars you like helped develop profiles of the persuadable.","There are three big takeaways here. The first one goes well beyond Trump’s election as president. Folks have been warning about this for years, but clearly we have created something of a monster in the rise of social media. Make no mistake: There are many positives you can attribute to sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram: reconnecting with friends from yesteryear, getting information about news or sports in real time, or launching powerful social movements. But at the end of the day, a capitalist company such as Facebook and its billionaire founder Zuckerberg have gotten rich by exploiting the essence of our humanity — our friendships and even our personalities — for profit. The Trump-Cambridge Analytica scandal is a two-lane highway to hell — your intimate personal data flowing north to shady operators, then flowing back south as divisive negative politics or even “fake news.” That’s an existential threat not just to democracy but to a broader civil society."],"isopubdate":""}

This content potentially puts the social media giant at risk of criminal prosecution.","\"Last month The Times created a fake profile on Facebook to investigate extremist content,\" Alexi Mostrous, the paper's head of investigations, reported Thursday. \"It did not take long to come across dozens of objectionable images posted by a mix of jihadists and those with a sexual interest in children.\"","Mostrous reported that a Times reporter posed as an IT professional in his thirties, befriended more than 100 supporters of the Islamic State (ISIS), and joined groups promoting lewd or pornographic images of children. He then \"flagged\" many of the images and ISIS videos.","Facebook moderators reportedly kept online pro-jihadist posts including one praising ISIS attacks \"from London to Chechnya to Russia and now Bangladesh in less than 48 hours,\" promising to bring war \"in the heart of your homes.\" The site's moderators also refused to remove an official news bulletin posted by the Islamic State praising the slaughter of 91 \"Christian warriors\" in the Palm Sunday bombings of two Egyptian churches.","Moderators, who are based in Ireland, California, Texas, and India, also kept up a video showing the gruesome beheading of hostages by ISIS terrorists.

The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

He had been a strong advocate for an aggressive approach to alleged Russian activity on the platform aimed at manipulating elections. His departure was first reported by the New York Times. Facebook declined immediate comment.","In a tweet, Stamos did not deny he was leaving but said: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook.

The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law.","Facebook said on Friday it had learned in 2015 that a Cambridge University psychology professor lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from a psychology testing application he had built.","Facebook said it suspended the firms and researchers involved and said the data had been misused but not stolen, because users gave permission.","“(Tech companies) are going to get a lot more scrutiny over what data they are collecting and how they are using it,” said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.","‘VERY CONCERNING’","European officials, who have been more willing to regulate Silicon Valley companies than their U.S. counterparts, were strident in criticism of Facebook.","The revelations about Cambridge Analytica were “horrifying, if confirmed,” said EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova. “We don’t want this in the EU and will take all possible legal measures” including stricter rules under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation that takes effect in May, she said.","A spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said the allegations were “clearly very concerning.”","The head of the European Parliament said EU lawmakers will investigate possible data misuse, calling the allegations an unacceptable violation of citizens’ privacy rights.","(This version of the story refiles to fix spell check errors of proper names and ticker symbol)","A 3D-printed Facebook logo are seen in front of displayed binary digits in this illustration taken, March 18, 2018.

The app can be used on various devices including smartphones and fitness trackers like Fitbit to see popular running routes in major cities, or spot individuals in more remote areas who have unusual exercise patterns.","However, over the weekend military analysts noticed that the map is also detailed enough that it potentially gives away extremely sensitive information about a subset of Strava users: military personnel on active service.","Nathan Ruser, an analyst with the Institute for United Conflict Analysts, first noted the lapse. The heatmap “looks very pretty” he wrote, but is “not amazing for Op-Sec” – short for operational security. “US Bases are clearly identifiable and mappable.”","“If soldiers use the app like normal people do, by turning it on tracking when they go to do exercise, it could be especially dangerous,” Ruser added, highlighting one particular track that “looks like it logs a regular jogging route.”","“In Syria, known coalition (ie US) bases light up the night,” writes analyst Tobias Schneider. “Some light markers over known Russian positions, no notable colouring for Iranian bases … A lot of people are going to have to sit through lectures come Monday morning.”","In locations like Afghanistan, Djibouti and Syria, the users of Strava seem to be almost exclusively foreign military personnel, meaning that bases stand out brightly. In Helmand province, Afghanistan, for instance, the locations of forward operating bases can be clearly seen, glowing white against the black map.","Zooming in on one of the larger bases clearly reveals its internal layout, as mapped out by the tracked jogging routes of numerous soldiers. The base itself is not visible on the satellite views of commercial providers such as Google Maps or Apple’s Maps, yet it can be clearly seen through Strava.","Outside direct conflict zones, potentially sensitive information can still be gleaned. For instance, a map of Homey Airport, Nevada – the US Air Force base commonly known as Area 51 – records a lone cyclist taking a ride from the base along the west edge of Groom Lake, marked on the heatmap by a thin red line.","Area 51, with a lone cyclist marked on the map. Photograph: Strava heatmap","RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands is lit up brightly on the heatmap, reflecting the exercise regimes of the thousand British personnel there – as are nearby Lake Macphee and Gull Island Pond, apparently popular swimming spots.","When Strava released the heatmap, an updated version of one it had previously published in 2015, it announced that “this update includes six times more data than before – in total 1 billion activities from all Strava data through September 2017. Our global heatmap is the largest, richest, and most beautiful dataset of its kind. It is a direct visualisation of Strava’s global network of athletes.”","Strava demonstrated that the new heatmap was detailed enough to see kiteboarding in Mexico, to track the route of the Camino de Santiago across northern Spain and to see the sea route of the Ironman triathalon in Kona, Hawaii. Perhaps the closest to the current operational security issues that it noted, however, was the layout of the Burning Man festival in the Nevadan desert. “The unique pentagonal pattern of Burning Man’s pop-up city is forever etched into the Heatmap, thanks to all the runners and cyclists who have used Strava to explore it,” the company wrote.","Need something explained?","Pick a question: We’ll answer the one that generates the most interest shortly"],"isopubdate":"2018-04-14"}

It Also Spies on You on the Web. Firefox Made an Add-on to Stop It | Inc.com","text":["Now the Firefox browser, offered by the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation, is offering a way to stop Facebook's tracking in the form of an add-on called Facebook Container. Installing that add-on makes it much more difficult for Facebook's algorithms to track what you do online.","Here's how it works: When you install the app, it will automatically log you out of Facebook. When you log back in, Facebook will run inside a digital container that isolates it from the rest of your activity online. There may be a downside in terms of convenience: If there are sites that you sign into using your Facebook credentials, you'll need to change your sign-in method. And if you're accustomed to clicking Facebook \"like\" or \"share\" buttons on other websites (such as this one), you'll have to actually copy and paste the link into Facebook instead. But Facebook will be effectively prevented from seeing what you're doing when you're not doing it on Facebook.","Obviously, Facebook is not the only company tracking your activity online. You know this already, especially if you've ever shopped for something online, decided not to buy it, and then seen ads for whatever it was dogging you across every website you visit for the next several days. So why is Mozilla focusing its attention on Facebook alone?","As Nick Nguyen, VP of Firefox product writes in a blog post, a lot can be inferred about you from the websites you visit. That information becomes exponentially more revealing when it's combined with your social media activity. It seems clear from the Cambridge Analytica scandal among other things that Facebook can't necessarily be trusted with this kind of deeply detailed data. As Nguyen notes, the Facebook Container would not have prevented Cambridge Analytica from gaining access to personal data on 50 million or more Facebook users. Still, it seems sensible to limit Facebook's privacy intrusions whenever you can.","Besides, Firefox isn't singling Facebook out. Its Multi-Account Containers allow you to build virtual walls around different parts of your life so that, for example, if you're at a website you'd prefer your employer not to know about, you don't have to open a separate browser to check your work email account.","There's something in it for Firefox, too, of course. With the new privacy-strengthened, super-fast Firefox Quantum browser it released last year, Mozilla, once a dominant browser, is hoping to win back some of the users it lost to Google Chrome. Google deserves a privacy black eye for creating the API that allowed Facebook to track users' phone calls and texts for years without their express permission. Perhaps this is just retribution.","So if the thought of Facebook or anyone else tracking your activity on the web makes you queasy, and it probably should, consider downloading and trying out Firefox Quantum and the Facebook or Multi-Account Container. As Nguyen notes, it's impossible for most of us to know what data is being collected and when, or what the implications are of companies like Facebook having that data. Until we do, better to keep that data to ourselves."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

In the ad, founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote “We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it.”","The company’s response to the Ars Technica story, however, struck a different tone, with Facebook titling the post “Fact Check: Your Call and SMS History.” It said “You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case,” before going on to explain that call and text history logging is included with an opt-in feature on Messenger or Facebook Lite for Android that “people have to expressly agree to use” and that they can turn off at any time, which would also delete any call and text data shared with that app.","Ars Technica has already amended its original post with a response to Facebook’s statement, saying it contradicts several of its findings, including the experience of users who shared their data with the publication.","“In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that Messenger was never installed on the Android devices I used,” wrote Ars Technica IT and national security editor Sean Gallagher in the amendment to his post. “Facebook was installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.”","In its statement, Facebook said “Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and services as a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with. This was first introduced in Messenger in 2015, and later offered as an option in Facebook Lite, a lightweight version of Facebook for Android .”","When people first sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android or log into Messenger on an Android device, they see a screen giving them the option to continuously upload contacts as well as call and text history. Facebook added that on Messenger, users are then given three options: to turn the feature on, “learn more” for more information or “not now” to skip it. On Facebook Lite, they get two options: turn it on or skip. If users who opted in change their minds later, Facebook said they could turn it off in the app’s settings, with the option of turning off continuous call and text history logging while keeping contact uploading enabled or deleting all contact information they’ve uploaded from that app.”","An image included with Facebook’s statement.","Facebook emphasized in bold text that it “never sell this data, and this feature does not collect the content of your text messages or calls.”","Even though the opt-in screens do state that granting permission will “continuously upload info” about contacts and call and text history, it is arguable that many users don’t really understand what that means and that instead of saying “this lets friends find each other on Facebook and helps us create a better experience for everyone” (a message sweetened with a saccharine cartoon of a figure texting a little heart), Facebook should really be giving more details about what exactly will be recorded and why.","With the Cambridge Analytica scandal still fresh on everyone’s minds, Facebook’s apparent willingness to place the onus for protecting personal data on users who already feel victimized is unlikely to help them regain any goodwill. But even people who truly understand the implications of the feature and chose to opt-in anyway did so assuming that their data would be guarded as Facebook promised. As the Cambridge Analytica fiasco threw into sharp relief, that hasn’t always been the case."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","See the full visual","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick Guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","See the full visual","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.","Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.","Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules.

The information was pulled from the man’s Android phone through its Messenger app.","The experience was found to be shared other users who relayed their findings to the Tech-news publication Ars Technica.

They then used Facebook’s targeted advertising system to display ads and content at those users geared towards their own psychological profile. Think of it as persuasive arguing on steroids hyper targeted by your own beliefs about the world.","For example, I let Cambridge Analytica analyze my data and they pegged me as a liberal. I know this may be a shocking revelation to all of my haters who believe I’m a conservative Russian agent conspiracy theorist who sells tinfoil hats for a living, but according to my Facebook data I’m a liberal. They also determined I’m more intelligent than 96% of Facebook users, and I somehow lost inteligence points because I like the Beatles (mostly a John Lennon fan), but that is a subject for an entirely different article.","What this means is Cambridge Analytica knows I am probably not going to vote for Trump based on my psychological profile. However, that is actually more valuable to them than not. There is little point to spending advertising dollars on people who you know will vote for your candidate, the person you want to target is actually the person who will not vote for your candidate and instead convince them to not vote. This is what I believe Cambridge Analytica did, I believe they targeted liberals in swing states and promoted anti-Hillary content in an attempt to convince people not to vote. It means they had to target fewer people, spend less money, and ultimately accomplish their goal of winning the election.","All Cambridge Analytica had to do was figure out who was a liberal, and convince them not to show up on election day. By doing so they could ignore everyone who couldn’t vote for whatever reason, and only spend a small portion of their budget on making sure Trump supporters showed up to vote. A no-vote was actually more powerful in swing states, where guess what? Liberal voter turnout was lower for Hillary than it was for Obama. Granted, I still think Hillary blew it and didn’t campaign properly. I am not excusing her ineptitude, she was a horrible candidate and I did not vote for her (Yes, I voted for the female doctor instead, and no I don’t regret it, lets just not talk about it, okay?).","Perhaps this is a just a giant coincidence, but I don’t think it is. Given Donald Trump’s ad spend, I’m fairly certain this is exactly what happened. The reason I believe this is because if I were hired to help win an election and had the tools and data Cambridge Analytica had, it is exactly what I would do. I don’t have anything to prove my theory unfortunately, but given what is being reported I am fairly certain I am on to something, and first came up with this theory a year ago before the media went into freak out mode.","This is why psychological profiling, privacy, machine learning, and artificial intelligence is so frightening when put in the wrong hands. It isn’t the machines we need to fear, it is the people who are in control of those machines and our data that we need to worry about. Machines are just tools, but people are fickle and with the right incentive easily corrupted.","Facebook, Not Russia, Helped Trump Win The Election","We know from Wikileaks that John Podesta was in touch with Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, and even thanked her for helping them “elect the first woman President of the United States.” However, Hillary didn’t win despite the fact Facebook was trying to get her elected alongside Google who was censoring search results, possibly running their own bots, and Twitter who was censoring the truth and purposely hiding Wikileaks tweets which are 100% factual (as they later admitted to congress).","The reason Hillary Clinton did not win despite the media and social media companies doing everything they could to rig the election in her favor is because Facebook double dipped and allowed Cambridge Analytica to use their surveying tools to collect user data on tens of millions of users. This data was then used to target tens of millions of users with political advertising using Facebook’s ad platform based on psycholgoical profiles from data they bought or acquired from Facebook.","Facebook is basically responsible for feeding the analytics system that enabled Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign to be so targeted and effective with a minimal budget. They ultimately won Donald Trump the swing states and the election. As well as subverted democracy, and likely made Facebook a bunch of money.","That’s what happened, that’s how Trump won. It wasn’t the Russians, it was our own social media companies who sold our data to the Trump campaign which they then likely used to convince liberals not to vote in swing states. It’s both horrifying, and cleverly brilliant at the same time."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

It also denied that the Facebook data was used by the Trump campaign and says it didn’t work on the Brexit referendum.","The company insisted Wylie was a contractor, not a founder.","For Facebook, the controversy appears to be taking a toll. On Monday, Facebook shares fell US$12.53 or 6.77 per cent to US$172.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.","Facebook has denied the data collection was a breach because people knowingly provided their information. The company has said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his test via his Facebook app.","Facebook has also said it would ban Cambridge Analytica, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded Kogan’s app. Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn’t disclosed it until now.","On Monday, Facebook said it hired a digital forensics firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine if the Facebook data the company collected still exists or if it’s been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica agreed to give the auditor complete access to its servers and systems, Facebook said.","The social-media giant said it’s also asked Wylie and Kogan to submit to an audit as well. It said Kogan has given his verbal agreement to do so and Wylie has declined.","The Facebook data breach exposed by Wylie in recent days has caused a commotion on both sides of the Atlantic and has caught the attention of Canada’s privacy watchdog.","“Recent media reports regarding the use of personal information posted on Facebook for political purposes raise serious privacy concerns,” Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien said in the statement.","“Our office will be reaching out to Facebook to seek information regarding whether Canadians’ personal information was affected by the issues raised in those reports. That will help us determine possible next steps.”","Therrien also said his office has offered to assist an investigation into the matter already launched by the U.K. information commissioner’s office. He said his ultimate goal is to ensure that the privacy rights of Canadian Facebook users are protected.","Asked Monday about the possible Facebook breach, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the government will take every step to protect the integrity of the Canadian democratic system.","“When an issue like that emerges, we all need to take it very, very seriously, make sure we get the facts and respond accordingly,” Goodale said in Ottawa.","“This is a rapidly moving, rapidly evolving situation because of technology. What we know or think we know today is likely to be radically different six months from now. And we have to be alert to every twist and turn along the way.”","On Monday, Wylie told NBC’s Today in an interview that Cambridge Analytica used data to create profiling algorithms that enabled the company to “explore mental vulnerabilities of people.” It enabled the firm to inject information into different forms of online content, so that people saw things that may not have been true, he said.","“This is a company that really took fake news to the next level,” Wylie said.","He also said he had left Cambridge Analytica before it joined the Trump campaign. But he added he knew the company met with Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in 2015, before Trump had announced his candidacy."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

It collects data from a wide range of sources, including social media platforms such as Facebook, and its own polling.","With its headquarters in London, the firm was set up in 2013 as an offshoot of another company called SCL Group, which offers similar services around the world.","In an interview with the website Contagious, Cambridge Analytica’s founder, Alexander Nix said it had been set up “to address the vacuum in the US Republican political market” that became evident when Mitt Romney was defeated in the 2012 presidential election.","“The Democrats had ostensibly been leading the tech revolution, and data analytics and digital engagement were areas where Republicans had failed to catch up. We saw this as an opportunity.”","Why is it in the news?","Kogan assembled the information through an app on the site – it collected details of Americans who were paid to take a personality test, but also gathered data on those people’s Facebook friends.","Kogan had a deal to share this information with Cambridge Analytica. But according to a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, most of this personal information had been taken without authorisation. He said Cambridge Analytica used it to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","In a statement published on Saturday, the company denied any wrongdoing and said it did not harvest Facebook data, and none was used in the 2016 presidential election. It said it fully complied with Facebook’s terms of service and it had deleted all the data it received from GSR.","What does Facebook say?","It has suspended Cambridge Analytica and several individuals from its site while it investigates. It denies there was a data breach, and says it had granted Kogan permission to access the information. However, in sharing it with Cambridge Analytica and allowing it to be used for commercial purposes, he broke the terms of the licence.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” it said.","It said it learned about the issue in 2015 and removed the app and demanded that the data was destroyed.","Who runs Cambridge Analytica?","The company is part of SCL Group and shares some of its directors. The main player is 42-year-old Nix, an old Etonian who joined SCL in 2003 after studying at Manchester University and working in corporate finance. Nix developed the political arm of the business. Last year, he told Techcrunch of plans to publish a book about the company, provisionally titled ‘Mad men to maths men’.","The managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division is Mark Turnbull, who spent 18 years at the communications firm Bell Pottinger before joining SCL.","What are Cambridge Analytica’s links with Donald Trump?","Robert Mercer, a key Trump supporter and donor, gave $15m in funding to Cambridge Analytica. Mercer, who also funded the rightwing website Breitbart, was introduced to the firm by Steve Bannon. Bannon, who was on its board from 2014 to 2016, headed the last phase of Trump’s election campaign and then served as his chief strategist.","The company worked on three candidates’ campaigns for the presidency, including Trump’s. On its website it describes analysing millions of data points to identify the most persuadable voters and the issues they cared about and then sending them messages to “move them to action”. Voters in 17 states were polled every day, and online advertising and social media used to send them messages. The company claims that in this way it boosted donations and turn out and contributed to Trump’s victory.","As we now know, some of the data came from profiles to which the company was not supposed to have access, rather than being freely available to harvest.","What other campaigns has it been involved with?","The company has worked on political campaigns in countries including Kenya, Colombia, India and St Kitts & Nevis.","What about Brexit?","What happens next?","There are likely to be questions for Cambridge Analytica and Facebook to answer. Nix may be asked by MPs to explain his position over Facebook data.","In the UK, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","In the US, Robert Mueller has asked for emails from the firm as part of his inquiry into Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election.","• This article was amended on 19 March 2018 to correct the spelling of Colombia."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of dictatorships and mafia states, exemplified by Vladimir Putin’s Russia, are on the rise. In the United States, President Donald Trump would like to establish his own mafia-style state but cannot, because the Constitution, other institutions, and a vibrant civil society won’t allow it.","Not only is the survival of open society in question; the survival of our entire civilization is at stake. The rise of leaders such as Kim Jong-un in North Korea and Trump in the US have much to do with this. Both seem willing to risk a nuclear war in order to keep themselves in power. But the root cause goes even deeper. Mankind’s ability to harness the forces of nature, both for constructive and destructive purposes, continues to grow, while our ability to govern ourselves properly fluctuates, and is now at a low ebb.","The rise and monopolistic behavior of the giant American Internet platform companies is contributing mightily to the US government’s impotence.

Owners and workers for those institutions act aggressively in the service of their own institution, in combat with other institutions, wittingly or unwittingly.The Nordic concept that what is good for 'The People' supersedes what is good for the siloed institution and its supporters is a socialist concept, not a free market concept, and means government regulation of institutions to ensure their disparate activities support an agreeable and successful 'community of all'.Needless to say, US siloed institutional culture is in combat with government regulatory efforts to create an agreeable society in America that is good for 'The People'.","Nordic countries are homogeneous. There is no way we can use them as a template for the United States, the least homogeneous country in the world. This isn't apples to apples. This is apples to snails.","It's not just social media that exploits society it's traditional media as well. The \"news\" is also totally beholden to advertising. The more minds they capture the more advertising revenue they earn, the more salaries they are paid and the more profits they make. \"Free speech\" today isn't free, it's beholden to advertisers and the strategies needed to capture their dollars.","The idea that we must protect people because we cannot trust them to think critically on their own is a very dangerous one. The idea we must use government to decide what can get published into the marketplace of ideas is even more dangerous. Somehow Soros has twisted his own philosophical learnings into the opposite of what he professes to value. Great trader, dangerous and misguided thinker.","I think you need to re-read his writing. Please point out the sentence where he says \"we must use gov't to decide what can get published\"? I don't see that anywhere.

The establishment only objects to it when it's being done by someone else.","A solution to social media might be found through market principles. The same logic which broke up Standard Oil and AT&T applies to the tech giants, but today's politicians lack the guts (or the integrity?) to act.","Interesting, but there is a difference between \"spin\" and \"fake news.\" Spin is agreeing on the same basic facts (let's say what journalists have found through interviews, data, etc), but INTERPRETING it through a different \"frame\" or lens. Fake news is claiming that journalists are just making up stories and information and data (like fiction writers). Such as when Trump said that there were more people at his Inauguration than ever before, ignoring the EVIDENCE of two pictures of Obama and Trump put side-to-side.","That is fake news of the most dangerous type -- created by our elected leaders (perhaps fed to them by their advisers with their own interests) with the power over life and death.

Blair/Bush is just an example. But, regardless, your memory seems short. During the war 54% of Brits SUPPORTED the war -- unfortunately, democracy is sometimes wrong. (I was in the streets in San Francisco protesting the war, so I'm not pro-war....I am simply trying to define terms and use evidence to examine issues). Here is the UK opinion polls (I would guess that the US numbers were even higher):","M Dallas. I dont think a 54% support for war is that surprising when a charismatic leader who believes he is guided by god is pounding the desk and propounding there are WMD.

While I agree that social media are a mural of idiocy, the real problem is the dire economic consequences of liberal trade and free capital flows. It is these which are causing the turn towards less liberal behaviors, simply because it is understood that once the nation-state is freed of the burden of depressing it's economy out of fear that benefits will be spent on imports (or make it's exports less competitive), then it will take care of it's citizens.","Also, like others, I have to agree that Soros' applaud of the European Union (and the miserable Eurozone) are inexplicable.","\"Freedom\" is great when it allows the Gated Community crowd to attack and destroy society, but \"freedom\" is bad when it enables the people to rebel.

Equally, your rabid defence of the EU is inexplicable - when many of the same dysfunctional issues are present in the EU: corruption; lying; false truths; deception; bullying and harassment etc this makes your blind support of the EU all the more puzzling???","Constitutions - the EU had a new Constitution which was renamed the Lisbon Treaty because the EU knew few if any Parliaments in the EU would pass it - the EU eradicated involvement by the people in the setting of their new European Constitution, it was made by appointees and steam rollered through Europe as a new Treaty when in fact it was a massive theft of national sovereignty.","The Internet - you complain about the Internet, but actually this is the most free medium the peoples of the world have had for generations. In Germany newspapers refuse to carry anti EU messages or allow people to speak, in fact much of the EU media is owned and controlled by pro EU views, even the BBC was captured by the EU through funding grants and their dirty tricks department and rebuttal offices have been working overtime to savage the democratic decision of the UK to leave the failing bloc. The internet is probably the only place people can find others who are as concerned about the death of democracy as they are and are stile (for the time being) allowed to speak freely.","Rich and successful people dominating the debate - I hope you are also including yourself Mr Soros, your unwelcome intereference in a democratic vote of the British people to leave the EU is a matter for us, not for you and certainly it is none of your business to try and turn a democratic vote or to give succour to those who would shun democracy. Please don't lecture us about people like Putin setting up Mafia States, the UK is one of the few countries where we can still think for ourselves and can see a danger coming when we see it, we saw that with the EUSSR! And sadly Mr Soros despite any good intentions you may have, all we can see (in you) is a very rich person, grown fat on the suffering of others telling us how our democracy should be run and that it should be run in a way that pleases you - if that is not terrifying I really don't know what is?","The Brexit issue, is a well founded fear of being subsumed by an unaccountable European Superstate masquerading as a benign bridge to prosperity and co-operation. However, when you look closely, you can see it was created to fool and entrap Europe and for the people of Britain, who would NEVER have voted to throw their sovereignty away to a German dominated Europe, a process of stripping away our rights; freedoms; control and sovereignty over our country has been a dastardly act perpetrated by all the political elites against their peoples and aided and abetted by questionable powerful people such as yourself.","One would like to imagine as you come to the end of your life how people will view your legacy Mr Soros? Have you helped to create employment in Africa? Have you sought to expose corruption and exploitation of the weak against the strong - or have you profited from the exploitation of others? And now lecture those you have stripped of their wealth that your way is the right way??","Apart from Bill Gates, there are very few extremely rich people I admire, being able to buy your view of the world is a whole different ball game to persuading people that you are right, and sadly Mr Soros, you and the EU because of the explotation; the lack of democracy and the lies are very wrong indeed.","Let the British leave in peace and get on with their choice to leave the EU - if you care anything for freedom and democracy you surely can see that the EU is very very far from that with absolutely no chance of every changing. Why would oyu want to condemn millions to another authoritarian regime, having just thrown off the chains of Communism - I find your logic alarming.","Oh dear!!! This coming from a \"subject\" of a Crown and once empire that has a long track record of breaking up anything that doesn't benefit its own interests... - India/Pakistan, China/Hong Kong, Israel/Palestine, Ireland North/Ireland South - and so forth. So, do not try to cover up the British historic lack of commitment to partnerships and the common good with a tailor-made and self-serving “freedom” excuse. England was never committed to the European Union… so much so that it never embraced the Euro and certainly it did nothing to make the European union better and feasible.Further, do not satanize others such as Mr. Soros in an attempt to justify your own country’s shortcomings and try to re-direct the attention to the messenger instead of the message.Mr. Soros is not my cup of tea and I am certainly critical of some of his business dealings as I am of the dealings and on going market manipulation of many mayor banks as well as government and official economic institutions.That though has no bearing on the quality and propriety of Mr. Soros analysis and the concepts expressed in his article.I think Mr. Soros analysis of the potential social and economic dangers of the current state of social media in most parts of the world is absolutely valid and even accurate. Further, I am deeply concerned with the uncertainties on the impact that the ever faster deployment of communications technology - we are months away from the deployment of 5G - as well as the roll out of AI will have in the evolution of social media as well as the life of people across the globe and hence on the social, economic and political fabric of the current human existence paradigm.My concern about Mr. Soros most valid comments has taken me to read again a book written in the 1940’s by a the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset - “The Rebellion of the Masses” - in search of some light to try and figure out what to expect if social media sponsored “Ochlocracy” ends up displacing liberal democracy.I believe though that the impact of whatever social-media and technology sponsored new paradigm is forged, it will hit developed economies and countries harder than less developed societies. Initially under-developed societies might have some chance of fast adapting to the new paradigm because they come from further back. In the long run though I can not bring myself to even imagine what will happen but I am weary of the harsh and violent image of the future being sponsored by Hollywood’s futuristic films and of modern video games.I do not agree though with Mr. Soros proposed formula to avoid the risks that the current social media has brought on. I think it is too late to try and control this unexpected phenomenon that has already become sort of a “force of nature”. I believe we would be better off trying to figure out a way to adapt and guide it as opposed to stop it. My duty though is not figuring out what will developed societies do since they have great thinkers that I am sure are trying to figure this one out. My duty is with under-developed countries such as Peru, with a long and rich social history that dates back to 4500 year BC, to find a way, and more important, to create the conditions, that guarantee that it will continue to be socially and culturally relevant in the uncertain new paradigm to come.In short, my duty today is to answer the call in the Toyota television ad of the Winter Olympics... “START YOUR IMPOSSIBLE!”; which I am doing.","Mr. Soros is an optimist. Every child owns a smartphone or can access one. Nobody has the attraction like the one a smartphone exert over a child. The mind develops through social interaction. Through the use of smartphones social interaction shrinks to zero.","I do respect George Soros but, in this case ,really, he ought to know better.","Would we blame the printing press for Der Sturmer?","We are finding out all over again that the threat of fascism appears to be a constant of human condition. Homo (barely) Sapiens is a bundle of animalistic emotion with a thin veneer of reason wrapped around it. His societies can be ruled by reason or by emotion. The former is colloquially known as democracy, the latter is colloquially known as fascism. Alas, the rule by reason requires constant work and vigilance. When the vigilance slips, as it does periodically, rule by emotion rares its ugly head.","There are many reasons for the current predicament. Sad to say, George Soros, or rather his chosen profession, is part of this reason. Generational forgetting is another.","There were real, underlying social reasons for the rise of fascism in the interwar Europe. Printing press or the radio were not the leading causes, and neither is the internet the leading cause today.","No single company controlled \"the printing press\" which is a MACHINE which took on myriad permutations and distributed through myriad companies used in myriad ways. He would love the multiplicity of the printing press. Now imagine a single company owned all printing presses, owned the technology of how to adapt and change and innovate on the original printing press. We'd still be using Guttenberg's original perhaps! FB, Google are MONOPOLIZING the printing press -- that is his point","Also, the printing press monopoly's economic model was to sell books to people, not people to companies or governments. By washing their hands of responsibility for content (both incoming form an outgoing to companies), the social media companies are able to get away with selling people... which in other forms is mostly outlawed.","Robert. You appear to see this as a power game where one lobby group is anesthetized by an opposing lobby group. That is not the way it works. A substantial voter bloc often have a predetermined position which is typically opposed by another substantial voter bloc. When neither bloc can dominate the outcome is determined by floating voters who are often bribed economically. Soros cannot change this, he has no economic input and his effort broadly falls under the propaganda banner. As far as Brexiteers go - the vote appears to be due to genuine economic disenfranchisement due to the collapse of trad industry and I very much doubt newspapers had much to do with it. Beneficiaries of the status quo voted Remain, losers voted Leave. Nothing Soros says will change that economic environment and critically hard core losers will not be bothered about general economic pain because they have nothing to lose. Rather than complaining about lobbyists you need to look hard at the long term policies that created localised industrial collapse without compensation. In particular you need, I suggest, to look at the Thatcher policy with N Sea Oil revenues which were used decade on decade to buy votes for short term political opportunity for Thatcher, in direct contrast to the policy in Norway where Oil revenues were used to build a sovereign fund whereby Norwegians are effectively individual millionaires through that fund. Europe is now facing its own industrial base collapse, other than Germany which is a beneficiary of euro imbalance. France and Italy both have recorded 10% deindustrialisation in the last decade. Greece is worse. Poland is an example of a beneficiary entirely due to EU handouts. I voted remain, but believe me Europe has its own storm coming because it does not have Oil revenues to buffer it like the UK did","Either America will catch up to the Europeans on this issue, or they won't.","And what will be the great harm if they don't? Extremely tiny numbers of people may purchase things they can't afford, while the vast majority will simply skip past the ads and infomercial style posts without stopping.","Any of the negatives you mention would simply manifest themselves in other ways in those very same people in the absence of the internet and social media.","The problem isn't the internet or social media, it's a lack of a proper education and self-esteem building in their younger years that would inoculate people from the traps of life -- of which, social media advertising is an infinitesimally small problem.","Nevertheless, it serves to illustrate that education and building self-esteem in young minds is the best way to prevent every social ill.","It is a \"Free World\", people can live on the top of the Hymalias, not read newspapers or utilise any of the social media tools and platforms. Or they can choose to stay up all night and tweet everybody and anybody. It is a matter of choice and \"self determination\". Can the author confirm with full confidence that none of his investments is associated directly or indirectly with any social media outlet?","It isn't a free world and never has been. It is always about balance. By that I mean who holds the balance of power. The power I prefer is held by a plurality of many actors which should result in a benign application and more choice for those who are subjected to its influence. When power becomes concentrated, it presents ever greater threat and loss of choice to those subjected to it. As for donations to fight Brexit, more power to Mr. Soros' elbow. Power in Britain has too long been resident in right-wing nationalists who regard themselves as inherently superior and fund sneering newspapers to hoodwink the population by appealing to prejudice, to use their votes against their own interests. The same thing happens in the US. Mr. Soros can see the imbalance and has a track record of trying to improve the balance. Bless the man.","Robert, the term \"Free World\" is clearly defined, and there are many sources that one can seek to obtain a clear definition of it. To simplify matters however, if it was not for the \"Free World\" neither you, nor I nor anybody else for this matter would have been able to communicate freely and more especially, Mr Soros or the Author would not have been able to publish this article or express their views on this or any other forum. Surely, you and Mr Soros are not trying to stop or to sanction freedom of expression, are you?","M M it is indeed a 'free world' for a lot of the world. Chomsky has an interesting definition of freedom, basically it is freedom to comply with the controlled environment which is why the word is so popular and permitted. By extension I would suggest that is also why the word populist with its negative image is used and permitted, it certainly is not allowed to be used in the same way as the word freedom. As Orwell said - control of what word means is control of everything. Soros appears to be complaining that social media freedom is not his definition of freedom; yet at the same time he is openly funding a 500K media campaign against Brexit which is simply an attempt to control an environment. Its no different to the sort of commercial activity he is complaining about on the internet because the objective is influence - but in this case it is justified as a matter of freedom. It really comes back to what the word means. Orwell would be laughing I suspect","MM No, it is Soros using freedom to subvert individual democratically enabled action which is exactly Chomsky's point - Freedom is strictly defined and limited by the elites and establishment - and not democracy. Soros is right that social media has its dangers. However social media also has its advantages precisely because it is immediate and difficult to control, even with AI censorship control is difficult simply because of the difficulty of controlling what a word means (Orwells hypothesis was the control of words to control language and control reality, but words morph continually). Although Soros claims to want democracy he wants his version of democracy which is fair enough as an individual but not as a funded lobbyist. However he is not alone in trying to influence, there are many agent provocateurs about. The principal of democracy is all are equal. Soros appears out of his depth in this arena and he doesnt help himself by the people he employs or funds because they just mirror which does not resolve his problem. He needs to sack them","I have read 29 comments looking for \"Who else has been developing and pushing the way to revive politics?“ That insight, emerged a few week after my Medium response \"Politics is dead, long live politics!\" to umair haque’s story “How Democracy Dies.”","Most philosophers in practice, for example, Zygmunt Bauman, Yanis Varoufakis, and recently Byung-Chul Han, have given great accounts that show politics is dead, but I am trying to find others than me that are trying to revive it.","Politics of The Wealth of Nations is dead. To revive politics I adapted one of Victor Hugo’s quote as: “There is nothing so powerful as #TheWealthOfGlobalization whose time has come.” The Twitter’s hashtag is one of many knowledge flows that have been emerging through me. So to revive politics we need to help emerge #TheWealthOfGlobalization.","Now, those knowledge flows that’s in line with your quotes “As Orwell said - control of what word means is control of everything” and “Orwells hypothesis was the control of words to control language and control reality, but words morph continually.”","I have read most of what's written in Mr. Soros' artcle from the article ‘How George Soros Upstaged Donald Trump at Davos,’ by John Cassidy, The New Yorker, January 25, 2018.”","Based on that article I wrote \"Based on the above, I wrote the Medium story “Making sure large high tech companies have visible #CharacterEthic #ProSystem CEOs.”","Jose ABoth Orwell and Chomsky (a linguist) talk about the power of language and how words are used and abused. Chomsky is quite left wing. Orwell's writing is now from sometime ago but still remains fresh. Both raise as many questions as they answer. Politics is not dead, in the West it has become more bipolar due to inequality and restricted social mobility. The problem then is society has no central policy ground and an enormous amount of effort goes into defending a position or attacking a position eg US current domestic politics, UK also. The danger becomes that what is demanded is action, any action. Hence Brexit and Trump, and Le Pen. Le Pen is interesting because she lost due to selling fear - a negative, not hope - a positive. Brexit was marketed as hope, as was Trump. European politics is due to be interesting with 2 important democracies Germany and Italy having mish mash policies due to having coalitions. If Trump cannot deliver he will walk into trouble with voters and he is running out of time, it typically takes about 3 years for policy to deliver something on the ground. In the bipolar politics the floating voter is more important than ever before and fickle by definition","Steve , with all sympathy for your effort to analyse politics: don't generalise the USA bipolarity to \"The west\" The USA has a horrible \"winner takes all\" voting system. Except the UK, European countries have multi-party systems. So their dynamics are different. keep that in mind.","Ferdinand, Thanks. You are quite correct it was written with the US and UK in mind. Its always a problem with generalising and trying to send out a response quickly. The winner takes all system with two large parties leads to yo-yo administrations where the opposition waits for the incumbents to fall out of favour - primarily with the floating voter. You have the situation where it is not about winning, its about letting somebody else lose","Words can be powerful. By saying “don't generalise the USA bipolarity to ‘The west’“ seems to me related to the assumption that globalization is a bad thing. Please consider a different understanding of win lose bipolarity.","In my framework there is #DarkGlobalization and #BrightGlobalization, the former as a result of the #ComputingBigShift by remaining under #TheWealthOfNations and the latter as a result of the #ComputingBigShift by letting direct democracy politics help emerge #TheWealthOfGlobalization.","Both the UK and USA voters without being aware of the #BrightGlobalization elected #DeGlobalization against the low trust #DarkGlobalization of Europe and Hillary Clinton representative democracy.","Can I say that representative democracy politics was bipolar stable for quite some time with the left and the right under #TheWealthOfNations until the emergence of the #ComputingBigShift when it became increasingly bipolar unstable under the #DarkGlobalization? To end instability and dissolve bipolarity, we need the emergence of the win win #BrightGlobalization of #TheWealthOfGlobalization in order to be able to create what I coined as the #SystemicCivilization.","Jose - 'bipolar stable' for food for thought I refer you to Chinese philosophy where the concept is stability does not exist other than a transition between growth or stagnation - or stagnation and growth. It is somewhat alarming because if it is a transition to look at the last state tells you where you might be heading","You are right Steve from the pure sense of stability that doesn't exist. Social things move all the time.","As can be seen in a graph of my March 2016 post \"Elections in USA, Germany, Spain, DR are under unstable equilibrium, as they were in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Spain,\" that now has four updates, stability for me is different. I see a ball moving back and forth to a center, like getting the left in power and maybe then the right in power.","In instability I see a ball moving to one extreme position away from the center, like #Brexit, #Trump, and the no so talk about first round of the French election.","I have a lot to say to respond what you wrote, but I will try to complement what I meant so that we get to the same page. My Medium response \"Politics is dead, long live politics!\" starts as follows:","\"Synthesis: most believe politics — the rules of the game of government — will not change. But now, once in 500 years, the people must be prepared to change those rules that have become far away from reality.\"","That response is a shortcut to my response that has the following introduction.","\"Representative democracy is dead, long live representative democracy! This response to the story “How Democracy Dies: The Collapse of Trust and the Loss of Faith in Human Possibility,” written by umair haque can be said to have started with the following post at the end of July 2014...\"","As you can see, Soros' says that \"The EU is better positioned, because it doesn’t have any platform giants of its own.“ Reframing that quote, today I wrote a tweet whose principal image says \"As the #EU doesn’t have yet platform giants of its own, Should it be a #SocialBusiness3DoC pioneer?“","Then amplifying what you said, I wrote a tweet without an image that says:","\"Might #SocialBusiness3DoC of #TheWealthOfGlobalization help #CharacterEthic people avoid Orwell's 1984 #SocialMedia of #TheWealthOfNations' manipulation of reality by the manipulation of words, like independence, #IndustrialCivilization, that control #PersonalityEthic people?\"","This comment is based on Peter Senge’s finding \"Structure influences behavior: different people in the same structure tend to produce qualitatively similar results.\"","That’s the dead representative democracy politics is the result of the structure of #TheWealthOfNations that in the past decades induces wrong behavior. This is the time for global direct democracy #GlobalDebout politics to act to representative democracy revive politics.","To do it, #CharacterEthic #GlobalDebout citizens must act on the Medium narrative \"Will #GlobalDebout (effective people) create the #SystemicCivilization?, whose summary says: \"this narrative is for citizens all over the world to follow Peter #Drucker’s suggestions about how to become effective individual and global citizens that avoid distractions.“","Steve absolutely right, freedom is great if Soros gets to be free, if like the UK we decide to use democracy to throw off the chains of the EU we are misguided and don't know what is good for us. Intelligent peoples with the facts in front of them can make that decision without the \"help\" of Soros manipulating the system.","Yes, Christine. Freedom is great *if* it allows people get to be free (and I agree with you wholeheartedly on the democracy/Brexit issue) and freedom is great *when* people are allowed to earn money and enjoy the rewards thereof.","I posit that when *if* and *when* doesn't happen, then it isn't freedom nor a democracy we're describing -- it's a kleptocracy or something worse -- and is such a person, organization, country or bloc worth saving? Even from themselves?","Like you and many others, I find Soros' assertions to be hypocritical and self-serving -- or, rather more likely, the utterances of a person who doesn't yet see the whole picture for what it really is -- due to spending far too much time living a gilded life.","The social media platforms in the west are fake public spaces, as they are owned by private compagnies, themselves getting their earnings from sellers, so essentially this platforms are shopping malls with social and cultural activities and gathering spaces sponsored by the ads paying sellers. The fake news avalanche is essentially surfing on the waves of the fake needs that the sellers try to generate, but fake news might be effective echos of real cultural needs, that can't be fulfilled by the fake needs department. So apparently real goods are fulfilling fake needs, while fake news are fulfilling real neads of e.g. freedom of thought or freedom from usurpatory political power.","I keep thinking of this excerpt from Lyotard's (controversial) Postmodern Condition: \"a person is always located at ‘nodal points’ of specific communication circuits, however tiny these may be.\" While not prepared to claim that postmodernism is a fertile subject, or as worthy as Mill, the above piece on social media might be described as discursive. Social media can be detrimental, and avoidable, but the point of the piece does not seem to involve things such as a postmodern cacophony when order is needed--or an \"Opium for the masses?\" Societies could benefit from regulation of monopoly media entities; perhaps it would be a sort of 'redistribution' of power to the populace. So, whether participation on such platforms is perhaps consistent with postmodernism asserting itself could be a weaker viewpoint. However, if you would like access to The Postmodern Condition in its entirety, you might need to have the resources of the Project-Syndicate contributor above. Everyone must know of Mill--even if no one goes to a bookstore to obtain his work anymore.","Narcissism and low self esteem are both linked and displayed on social media, its got nothing to do with nodal points in communication, its behavioural with an overlay of automated conditioning by software.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

Here's how.","Author:\nRob Pegoraro, Special for USA Today","Published:\n4:42 PM EDT March 21, 2018","Updated:\n4:45 PM EDT March 21, 2018","Ever downloaded an app through Facebook? Time to check your privacy settings.","Reports that the political research firm Cambridge Analytica obtained the personal data of 50 million-plus Facebook users through a personality-quiz app should have anybody on the social network uneasy over the third parties they’ve let into their account.","Facebook allows apps to access much of users' profile information but has tightened up some controls. For instance, it prevents apps from seeing the personal data of people in your friends' list, the giant loophole the British researcher legitimately used to access data that the researcher allegedly then, against Facebook's rules, sold to Cambridge Analytica — a misuse the social network knew about three years ago.","Things after that depend on what the app or site asked and what you allowed. An app can ask for access to anything in your profile — and can declare some of that information “required” — and you have to decide if you trust it with that data and if you trust the developer to delete your information should you later remove the app.","Apps used to be a big deal on Facebook, leading to the huge popularity of Farmville and Words with Friends, meaning that even if you haven't downloaded a Facebook app, you may already have given an app developer leeway to access your details.","Once you add an app to your Facebook profile or use your Facebook account to log into another site, it’s easy to forget the exposure you incurred and with whom you did business. Both things — the “what” of an app or site’s access to your data and the “who” of that outside company — matter.","You can check both in a desktop browser or Facebook’s mobile apps.","In a browser, click or tap the downward-facing triangle at the top right, then select “Settings” then “Apps.”","In Android, tap the three-line button at the top right, select “Account settings,” then “Apps.”","In iOS, that button is at bottom right, after which you tap “Settings,” “Account Settings” then “Apps.”","In either mobile app, tap a “Logged in with Facebook” banner.","You’ll now see a list of apps and sites, grouped by who on Facebook can see you use them — everyone, friends only, a custom setting or only you.","At a minimum, they all get what any stranger logged into Facebook would: “your name, profile picture, cover photo, gender, networks, username, and user ID.”","Things after that depend on what the app or site asked and what you allowed.","For example, in my account it showed that the Amex Offers app had access to my friends list, Likes and current city. I turned off friends-list and Likes sharing but let the city setting stand: American Express already knows where I live. The reading app Flipboard, however, only had access to my public profile.","To evict an app, click or tap the “X” next to its name. If you don’t recognize it, bring up its details and then click or tap “App Privacy Policy.”","Login with Facebook?","When you add an app or use Facebook to sign up at a different site, you should see a Facebook dialog explaining your data exposure, some of which you can decline.","For instance, using Facebook to log into the Guardian — the British newspaper that, with The New York Times, first reported the extent of the Cambridge Analytica data heist — yields a notice that the Guardian will see your public profile and email address.","That Facebook dialog lets you hide your email, although the Guardian’s own site will then ask you to provide it anyway.","(USA TODAY also lets readers sign up via Facebook, subject to sharing public profiles; in addition, this site employs Facebook’s comments system.)","What happened before the election?","This entire system assumes that an app developer will tell the truth, which did not happen in the Cambridge Analytica case.","As Facebook explained in a Friday night post announcing that British company’s suspension, the “thisisyourdigitallife” app created by University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan purported to be an academic research exercise.","But Kogan then gave Cambridge the data coughed up by some 270,000 people in 2013 — including details about their Facebook friends, an option that Facebook ended in 2014 and which allowed that app’s reach to hit that 50 million figure.","After this clear violation of Facebook’s rules — “Don't sell, license, or purchase any data obtained from us or our services” — Cambridge used that information to construct a ad-targeting operation used by President Trump’s 2016 campaign, according to The New York Times report.","Cambridge Analytica has said it fully complied with Facebook's terms of service, while the Trump campaign denied using voter data from Cambridge Analytica.

The author’s list of enabled apps on Facebook.","Screenshot","In 2013, an app called Lulu briefly became the object of the internet’s fascination and scorn. The app’s purpose was to allow women to rate men, Yelp-style, and I had mostly forgotten all about it, writing it off as just another problematic app in a world full of them. My memory was jogged, however, by the news that the political-data firm Cambridge Analytica may have harvested as many as 50 million user profiles by inappropriately using information extracted from Facebook through a personality app. I wasn’t one of the nearly 300,000 users who had enabled that app, but I easily could have been one of the users whose data was hoovered up as a result of its advent. So I went to the Facebook page that lists the apps that have permission to stalk my profile, and sitting there I discovered my own personal blast from the past: Lulu.","While I hadn’t thought about Lulu in years, all along it’s been allowed access to my profile, friend list, birthday, photos, and more. The app was sold to Badoo in 2016 and seems to be defunct now, which is probably for the best. But it’s just one of the dozens of apps I’ve given permission to access my Facebook data over the years. And the list of them is quite a walkabout the past few years of the social web: There are some recognizable names in there, like Airbnb and Spotify, both of which required users to sign up through Facebook when I first got them. I also spy Words With Friends and various knock-offs, Draw Something, a quiz that tells you which Lost character you are (I’m a Hurley), and the app for the long-dead News Corp iPad-native newspaper, the Daily. Lulu might not even be the most embarrassing one—when did I give Facebook access to Kim Kardashian: Hollywood? I think of myself as fairly conscientious about these things—I’ve definitely gone in and disabled an app or two over the years—and yet my list is just as cluttered as anyone’s, full of apps I never use and certainly wouldn’t want to have access to the full or even partial dossier of what Facebook knows about me.","What previously might have looked like a case of bad digital hygiene now seems like potentially something much worse, thanks to what’s come to light about Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook. The firm, which worked on the Trump presidential campaign in 2016, paid 270,000 users to participate in a 2014 personality survey to help the firm build psychological profiles. Those who signed up also gave permission for the app to scrape some of their data, and due to Facebook’s rules at the time, apps were permitted to scrape not only information from users who signed up but also the information of their friends on the social network, which is how the number ballooned from something in the hundreds of thousands into the tens of millions.","You can see how this would have a person reconsidering every app she ever gave permission to access her Facebook data. If Lulu was craven enough to release an app that was all about superficially rating men, who knows what nefarious stuff it was doing on the down-low? Not to mention some of the apps I enabled back in the day that make Lulu look fastidious and well-thought-out in comparison. Anyone remember whatwouldisay? It was a bot designed to create Facebook statuses based on your past updates, and I must have enabled it in 2013, because that was the year of its short-lived heyday. It was designed by a team of six graduate students at a Princeton Hackathon weekend, and I’m guessing they didn’t put much effort into permissions at the time. Does that mean that, if, say, one of those six kids was running low on cash now or in the future, he or she could sell my profile data for a quick buck? Maybe! I have a bunch more similarly weird apps enabled—Zaarly? Playster?—and though I could disable them all now, what would that mean for the information they already have on me? Does it even matter, since apparently Facebook rules used to allow the apps people I was friends with were using to give up data on me, regardless of whether I gave permission? And what lesson should any of us take from this, other than we should be mindful of who can access our data and for how long, and/or that we might all be better off absconding to caves?","When I signed up to play a new game or to try a new startup service back in the halcyon days of Facebook being a not-scary place, I thought at worst I was subjecting myself to some spam, the digital equivalent of a few years of Pottery Barn catalogs. What many of us realized too late is that when the data operation is large and potentially leaky as Facebook’s is, this information has applications beyond selling throw pillows. It might be used to elect a president."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

With that in mind, here is an overview of the groups involved, what happened — and what it means.","1. What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a data firm that promises its customers insights into consumer or voter behavior.","On the commercial side, that means tools like “audience segmentation” — breaking out advertising audiences into smaller groups — and then targeting advertisements to those groups on “multiple platforms.”","On the political side, it is much the same thing, with one tweak. While advertisers generally target consumers as groups, political campaigns need to target specific people — registered voters receptive to a potential message.","“Combining the precision of data analytics with the insights of behavioral psychology and the best of individually addressable advertising technology,” the company’s website pledges, “you can run a truly end-to-end campaign.” And that is why Cambridge Analytica was created.","Robert Mercer is a prominent conservative donor whose public profile rose sharply over the past few years. He and his daughter Rebekah invested millions in efforts to reshape conservative politics, funding Citizens United, the anti-mainstream-media Media Research Center and Breitbart News.","In 2013, Robert Mercer partnered with a British firm called SCL Group and its elections director Alexander Nix to test SCL’s methodology in Virginia’s governor’s race, as the New York Times reported. Their candidate, Republican Ken Cuccinelli, lost. But the Mercers moved forward with a political data strategy anyway, partnering with Nix to create Cambridge Analytica, which would use SCL’s data and methodology for political work.","2. What prompted the Facebook suspension?","The key part of the Cambridge Analytica sales pitch is that “insights of behavioral psychology” line.","There are lots of data companies that can tell you who’s registered to vote, and there are lots of companies that compile consumer data on those same voters. This, in fact, was an instrumental part of Facebook’s sales pitch to political campaigns (back before it quietly buried that pitch in the wake of questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election). After the 2014 election, we wrote about how Facebook offered campaigns a place to overlap their voter data (who’s registered and basic demographic information) with Facebook’s vast array of data on its users’ behavior. While most firms that collect data on consumer behavior do so by tracking the bread crumbs we leave around our consumer culture — grocery store rewards cards, magazine subscriptions, etc. — Facebook has the advantage that so many Americans tell the company precisely what they like, by quite literally clicking the “like” button.","Facebook’s database of personal information may be the largest in the world, given that nearly a third of the globe has an account with the company. If you are a company looking to provide data services, you would justifiably be jealous of the information Facebook possesses. So Facebook (recognizing an opportunity when it sees it) provides a way for software developers to build on top of their platform, allowing other companies to use their data under certain conditions. It used to be fairly trivial, in fact, for developers to build an application that would then pull a great deal of information from the site, including information about your friends’ activity. In May 2014, the site announced it was tightening that access, beginning the following year.","That change came slightly too late.","To apply its “insights of behavioral psychology” to national politics, as the Mercers intended, the SCL/Cambridge team needed a lot of information about a lot of Americans. According to the Times’s report, a Cambridge employee named Christopher Wylie encountered a researcher at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan built an application that leveraged Facebook’s tools to pull information from the site and then pitched its use using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a tool that allows developers to hire humans (sometimes then referred to as “turkers”) to do simple tasks for small fees.","“The task posted by ‘Global Science Research’ appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would ‘download some information about you and your network … basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.’ ”","Global Science Research was Kogan. Using this method, he gathered information on tens of millions of Americans. (The Times says more than 50 million; other outlets say 30 million.) That information was then used to build out SCL/Cambridge Analytica’s profiles.","In building his Facebook application, Kogan had pledged that his data collection was only for research purposes and that it would remain anonymized — not able to be linked to specific people. When the Guardian reported in late 2015 on the link between Kogan and Cambridge, it prompted Facebook to promise to investigate the situation. (The Guardian’s story was pegged to Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) presidential campaign using Cambridge Analytica for its voter contact efforts. Cruz was strongly supported by the Mercers, who also created well-funded outside groups to promote his candidacy.)","In its statement on Friday announcing the suspensions, Facebook carefully put the blame on Kogan misusing its tools and explained it had demanded in 2015 that Kogan, SCL and Cambridge delete its Facebook data. The suspension was prompted by learning last week — apparently after being contacted by the Times — that Cambridge was still in possession of some of the Facebook data. (The company denies that.)","3. What does Cambridge Analytica’s data actually look like?","It is not clear, but we do have one hint.","A professor at New York’s New School named David Carroll was studying ad targeting when he realized Cambridge’s link with SCL meant the company might be subject to Britain’s broader data-access laws, allowing him to potentially see what data the company had collected on him. In March 2017, he got a response.","It is not clear how Cambridge/SCL developed that profile of Carroll (which he described on Twitter as “accurate”), but one can see how Facebook data might help inform those categories.","One can also see how, once the profile was developed, the Facebook data underlying it would become unnecessary. It is as though you sneaked a peek at the secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken and then developed your own recipe based on it. You may not be in possession of the recipe, but that is sort of beside the point.","4. Where does the Trump campaign fit into this?","Trump’s digital team was run by Brad Parscale, who last month was named campaign manager for Trump’s 2020 effort. Trump’s general election campaign was slow to get geared up after the primary, and, by mid-2016, there was a debate over how to invest in digital marketing. Bolstered by Parscale’s advocacy (and Jared Kushner’s championing) the campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, over then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s apparent objections. The decision may have been made easier, too, by Cambridge/SCL’s role in the successful Brexit campaign in Britain the same month.","As noted above, the Mercers had been hoping Cruz would be the Republican nominee. Once Trump won the Republican nomination, though, they shifted their focus. (The extent to which the hiring of Cambridge Analytica greased that transition is not clear.) They were reportedly instrumental in the August 2016 overhaul of Trump’s campaign, recommending the hiring of both Stephen K. Bannon (from Breitbart) and Kellyanne Conway, who had been working for one of their pro-Cruz PACs.","Over the last few months of the campaign, Parscale’s team invested heavily in Facebook advertising, even hosting a Facebook employee at their Texas war room who helped guide their work. The advertising the campaign deployed was informed by Cambridge Analytica’s data.","Bloomberg reported on the data team shortly before the election and how Parscale managed the competing data from Cambridge and the Republican Party.","“Parscale was building his own list of Trump supporters, beyond the RNC’s reach,” Bloomberg’s Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg wrote. “Cambridge Analytica’s statistical models isolated likely supporters whom Parscale bombarded with ads on Facebook, while the campaign bought up email lists from the likes of Gingrich and Tea Party groups to prospect for others.”","One footnote: Campaign adviser Michael Flynn also contracted with SCL shortly before the end of the campaign, though he apparently never did any work for the company.","5. Does this mean Trump won the election unfairly?","Well, this is a broader question: Does Cambridge help win elections? Or, put another way: How much of Cambridge’s rhetoric about psychographics is just hype?","6. Fine. Where has Cambridge Analytica won elections?","In most cases, it is very hard to identify one particular factor that made the difference in a political campaign. Despite the ubiquity of politicking, campaigns do not happen that often and, when they do, there are thousands of factors that make each contest unique. So analyzing the effects of campaign tactics means perusing a small sample in which we are asked to compare apples to oranges to grapes to dogs to stars to love to six.","This is hugely advantageous for political consulting firms because it is often hard to check their claims about how effective they are. Politicians are deeply superstitious and seize on their own and others’ past successes to guide their decisions moving forward. What’s more, the field of data-driven political persuasion is fairly new, meaning a company that can claim success in a realm many career politicians do not really understand has a huge marketing advantage. Say that you have cracked the code to targeting voters with specific messages, and a lot of campaigns will write you checks.","Cambridge Analytica has not been around that long, but they have been involved in several successful campaigns. There was Sen. Thom Tillis’s (R-N.C.) Senate campaign in 2014, which he won by 1.5 points. There was the “Leave” campaign in the United Kingdom in 2016 which won by 3.8 points. And there was Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.1 points but won the electoral college.","There were also losing campaigns. Before Trump, the highest-profile effort Cambridge undertook was Cruz’s — and he lost. Sure, he ended up in second place in the delegate count despite being fairly unpopular the year before, but his strategy was like Trump’s: leverage a core base of support to ride out a crowded field of candidates.","In June 2016, Politico reported that Cruz’s team “was disappointed in Cambridge Analytica’s services and stopped using them before the Nevada GOP caucuses in late February, according to a former staffer for the Texas Republican.”","So it is hard to say in the abstract the effect Cambridge might have had in Trump’s race — and it is harder still to say what role the laundered Facebook data played.","About a year after the election, Cambridge’s Nix said in an interview that his firm wasn’t able to leverage its psychographics on Trump’s behalf.","Here is Nix, speaking to TechCrunch:","“We just didn’t have the time to rollout that survey. … We had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (it’s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as I’ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly there’s psychographic data that’s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because we’re not reinventing the wheel. [We’ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and we’ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitative psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didn’t have time. We just couldn’t do that.”","7. Is special counsel Robert S. Mueller III tracking this whole thing?","Apparently.","Given that the Trump campaign and Cambridge invested so much in targeting people online, and given that we know Russian actors tried to leverage Facebook ads and social media to influence voters, there is a natural question as to whether those two efforts had any coordination.","In July, McClatchy reported Mueller’s team was looking specifically at that.","“Congressional and Justice Department investigators are focusing on whether Trump’s campaign pointed Russian cyber operatives to certain voting jurisdictions in key states,” Peter Stone and Greg Gordon wrote. They quoted a former Pentagon staffer named Mike Carpenter. “There appears to have been significant cooperation between Russia’s online propaganda machine and individuals in the United States who were knowledgeable about where to target the disinformation,” Carpenter said.","8. So are there links to Russia?","Well, it depends on what you mean by “links.” We are in this weird moment where any even tangential link to Russia or a Russian person is heralded as a sign of questionable collusion.","So here is what we know.","The Times reports that SCL Group had spoken with the Russian oil giant Lukoil in 2014 and 2015, and that the company “was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey.” (In an interview with the “Today” show on Monday, Wylie reiterated this claim.)","The paper also notes that Cambridge included questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 focus groups, though we will note this was also the time period in which Russia’s seizing of Crimea became central to American foreign policy conversations.","Late last year, the Daily Beast reported that Nix had contacted WikiLeaks’s Julian Assange before the election offering to host emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman to create a searchable database. Assange declined the offer. Those emails are believed to have been stolen by Russian hackers linked to the country’s intelligence agencies.","One other link is worth mentioning. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher who developed the tool that led to the Facebook suspension, had reportedly also received a grant from the Russian government to research social media.","“Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way,” Kogan told the Guardian."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg issued a long non-apology on Facebook, and appeared on cable news to explain how the company was responding to what he called “a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it.”","Zuckerberg should have heeded what he heard from the late Steve Jobs eight years ago. Then, when the social network had a measly half-billion users, Jobs spoke at The Wall Street Journal’s AllThingsD conference, where Zuckerberg was in the audience, waiting to be interviewed himself, and described what privacy meant.","Journalist Walt Mossberg asked Jobs his thoughts on recent privacy issues around Facebook (which at the time was revamping its privacy controls after criticism it was forcing people to share data) and Google (which was literally recording private wifi information), and whether Silicon Valley looks at privacy differently than the rest of the world.","“Silicon Valley is not monolithic,” Jobs responded, “We’ve always had a very different view of privacy than some of our colleagues in the Valley.” Apple, for instance, does not leave it up to developers to decide whether to be dutiful about warning users that their apps are tracking their location data, instead forcing pop-ups on users to alert them that an app is tracking them, and to turn off that ability if they don’t want. “We do a lot of things like that, to ensure that people know what these apps are doing,” he added. It’s a stance his successor, Tim Cook, still holds.","Mossberg then asked Jobs if that applied to Apple’s own apps in the cloud. Here’s what Jobs said:","Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly. I’m an optimist; I believe people are smart, and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data.","Zuckerberg has faced criticisms about as long as Facebook has been around about how it handles its users’ data. He apologized in 2007 when a Facebook product took user tracking too far. In 2010, he acknowledged the privacy problem again, and the company changed its settings. And in 2014. And now again in 2018. If the company had been more forthright about how developers could take data shared with them by Facebook users and sold to third parties, it may not have been in the mess it’s in today.","“A lot of people in the Valley think we’re really old-fashioned about this,” Jobs said in the interview, “And maybe we are, but we worry about stuff like this.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers. Facebook said this was standard practice for large political and corporate spenders.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

{"originalurl":"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n07/william-davies/why-the-outrage","title":"William Davies · Cambridge Analytica · LRB 5 April 2018","text":["Short Cuts","William Davies","There is at least one certainty where Cambridge Analytica is concerned. If forty thousand people scattered across Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania had changed their minds about Donald Trump before 8 November 2016, and cast their votes instead for Hillary Clinton, this small London-based political consultancy would not now be the subject of breathless headlines and Downing Street statements. Cambridge Analytica could have harvested, breached, brain-washed and honey-trapped to their evil hearts’ content, but if Clinton had won, it wouldn’t be a story.","The villains of the piece would no doubt agree with this assessment, but not for very plausible reasons. The exposé conducted by Channel 4 News, with the support of the Observer and the New York Times, captured the now suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, bragging to someone he believed was a potential client that he’d met Trump ‘many times’ and master-minded the entire Trump campaign strategy. Nix implies that those forty thousand votes were scientifically wrested from Hillary and delivered to Trump thanks to micro-targeted advertising and some especially persuasive messaging. ‘Our data informed all the strategy,’ Nix says, with the swagger of an estate agent reporting that demand for period features is red-hot right now.","It’s true that Cambridge Analytica was recruited to work on the Trump campaign, though not necessarily because of its Machiavellian brilliance. Steve Bannon, Trump’s campaign manager, was on the board of the company at the time, and probably tossed it a contract for some data analysis so as to keep things between friends. When the company first attracted attention in the British media in early 2017, it was reported as also having had close ties to the Leave campaign. In one of several investigative reports on the topic, the Observer’s Carole Cadwalladr wrote in May 2017 that ‘what is happening in America and what is happening in Britain are entwined. Brexit and Trump are entwined. The Trump administration’s links to Russia and Britain are entwined. And Cambridge Analytica is one point of focus through which we can see all these relationships in play.’","Against that heady backdrop, the more recent revelations must register as something of an anticlimax, not least for Cambridge Analytica’s more gullible clients. First, there is no firm evidence that Cambridge Analytica provided consultancy services to any of the major players in the EU referendum of 2016. Nix initially bragged in an article that it had, but confessed to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee in February this year that the article had been drafted by a ‘slightly overzealous PR consultant’. Certainly we should try to understand how ‘Brexit and Trump are entwined,’ but that requires sociological and economic analysis: the process won’t be as simple (or as exciting) as identifying a secret control room.","Second, there is not – and cannot be – any evidence that it swung the election for Trump (by the same token, it isn’t strictly provable that it didn’t), though unsurprisingly the company claims otherwise. This still appears painful for Clinton herself to accept. Interviewed for one of the Channel 4 reports, she speaks of Cambridge Analytica’s ‘massive propaganda effort [which] affected the thought processes of voters’. And yet data analysis is at the heart of modern political campaigning. Clinton, after all, preferred to study data on Michigan from the comfort of her Brooklyn campaign office than actually to visit the state, even as panicking Michigan Democrats pleaded with her to spend time there in the final weeks. If things had turned out differently, there would no doubt have been star-struck puff pieces on the bleeding edge data analytics that were behind the election of America’s first female president.","The scandal is twofold, but neither part really concerns elections. The first is the ‘data breach’, which granted the Trump campaign access to fifty million Facebook profiles without the users’ permission. This occurred by means of the abuse of a simple app called thisisyourdigitallife, the like of which many Facebook users will have come across. Apps such as this appear in a user’s newsfeed as a personality questionnaire, producing relatively banal results which can then be shared with friends. Thisisyourdigitallife was built by Aleksandr Kogan, a psychologist at Cambridge University, to test theories of personality-modelling on the basis of Facebook ‘likes’. Only 270,000 people ever used the app, but it also collected data on their friends – a feature of how Facebook works, rather than of Kogan’s wizardry.","Facebook knew of thisisyourdigitallife, but was under the impression it was geared purely towards academic research. Any user who checked the terms and conditions (and who among us ever does that?) would have thought the same. What nobody knew until earlier this month was that Kogan was passing the data straight to Cambridge Analytica, which was then putting it to work for Bannon. All of this was told to the Observer by a whistle-blower at Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie: the story appeared under the headline, ‘I made Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool.’","Various rules were broken. Privacy law assumes that individuals have the right to know what their data is being used for before they agree that someone may collect and keep it. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were being dishonest and secretive. But while they may not have been true to every letter of their Ts and Cs, and may be in breach of the Data Protection Act, no one, surely, will be surprised to discover that data collected in one arena is put to work in another. Using data in novel (and secretive) ways is virtually the governing principle of the digital economy – what Shoshana Zuboff has termed ‘surveillance capitalism’, and Nick Srnicek calls ‘platform capitalism’.","It’s worth remembering that throughout the 1990s, the internet was viewed as a threat to capitalism as much as an opportunity. Napster was the iconic example. It wasn’t clear where the profits lay, once information was abundant and individual anonymity was the norm. What changed, as Zuboff and Srnicek both explore in different ways, was that the internet began to be treated as a surveillance device of potentially global proportions: cheaper, better or free services were provided on condition that the ‘user’ would be tracked in everything they did and anchored in their offline identity. The fact that most tech giants made – and in Uber’s case still make – vast losses for the first few years of their existence is integral to this strategy. People must be lured into using a service and then kept using it by whatever means necessary; only later is this power converted into revenue.","To suggest that a Facebook user consents to all the ways Facebook uses or might use their data is completely to misrepresent the logic at work here. For that matter, to say that a Guardian reader consents to all the ways the Guardian uses their data (which they deposit every time they visit the website) is to misunderstand the essentially malleable nature of data itself. Its potential value and use emerges after one has collected it, not before.","In the panic surrounding Trump and Cambridge Analytica, this brute capitalist reality has been mysteriously referred to as ‘harvesting’. But if creating an app to collect data without people’s conscious knowledge is ‘harvesting’, then so is a great deal else. By creating free wifi on the London Underground, Transport for London is harvesting data (the wifi network was installed to provide TfL with real-time data on passenger movements). The UK Government Digital Service has harvested data on citizens by manipulating the design of government websites (the common practice of ‘A/B’ testing means different users see different website designs, with data collected on how this affects click-throughs and time spent on each page). Uber harvests data well beyond car journeys (the app continues to collect data on passenger behaviour after a ride has finished, although users can now opt out of this). New digital advertising billboards at Piccadilly Circus are harvesting data (they contain cameras to analyse the facial expressions of people in the crowds passing by).","The second aspect of the recent scandal is grubbier but ultimately less significant. If its own sales pitch is to be believed (an ‘if’ that grows larger by the day), Cambridge Analytica likes to play dirty. Nix and his colleague Mark Turnbull were caught by Channel 4 discussing techniques of honey-trapping, blackmail and counter-intelligence in a manner that owed more to James Bond plots than to psychometrics. Throwaway remarks, that the candidate is just a ‘puppet’ to the campaign team and that ‘facts’ are less important than ‘emotion’, look shady when caught on a hidden camera, but they’re not categorically different from the early ruthlessness of New Labour operators such as Alastair Campbell, Philip Gould and Peter Mandelson. Nor is there any reason to assume that New Labour’s 1990 analogue methods of data analysis – focus group and polling – are less informative or useful than automated psychometrics. As for Nix’s boast that they ‘operate in the shadows’, and his parting shot to the ‘client’ (‘I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you’), it’s a wonder the Channel 4 investigator managed to keep a straight face.","So we have a misuse of data, which has rightly attracted the attention of the Information Commissioner’s Office, and some excitable marketing patter, which slips into Mafia fantasy before being swiftly retracted at the first sign of actual danger. The former issue isn’t exactly news: in 2010 the Wall Street Journal found that Facebook apps (such as the one built by Kogan) were routinely collecting information for the benefit of advertisers and internet tracking companies, without users’ consent. Given Facebook’s command of the world’s attention (more than two billion monthly active users, who spend an average of fifty minutes on the site every day), it is inevitable that attention merchants flock to the site in search of the scraps, just as major sporting events attract ticket touts.","Why so much outrage? The Observer should be congratulated for its tenacity on the topic, and this story may, with luck, push us towards a tipping point on the issue of data privacy. But the fascination and shock that Cambridge Analytica is attracting suggests a displacement of horror that really stems from something deeper. Part of that must lie with Trump and Trumpism. A terrible event must surely have been delivered by equally terrible means. Passionate Remainers no doubt feel similarly about Brexit. It is clear that various secretive and underhand forces did intervene in the US election campaign. Thanks to Robert Mueller’s investigation, we know that Facebook sold $100,000-worth of advertising space to Russian ‘troll farms’, and that 126 million Americans may have been exposed to Russian ‘fake news’ over the course of 2015 and 2016. Then there is the FBI’s resurrection of the matter of Clinton’s emails at a critical moment in the election campaign. Whether any of this gets us closer to explaining or understanding Trump’s victory is moot.","Cambridge Analytica looks conveniently like a smoking gun, primarily because it has repeatedly bragged that it is one. Nix and Turnbull do for the events of 2016 what ‘Fabulous’ Fab Tourre, former Goldman Sachs banker, and Fred ‘The Shred’ Goodwin, former boss of RBS, did for the banking crisis of 2008, providing grotesque personalities on which to focus anger and alarm. To hear such men proudly declaring their lack of moral conscience is paradoxically reassuring to the degree that it helps explain the world’s loss of moral direction. But as with the financial crisis, the circus risks distracting from the real institutional and political questions, in this case concerning companies such as Facebook and the model of capitalism that tolerates, facilitates and even celebrates their extensive and sophisticated forms of data harvesting and analysis.","It is telling that two of the greatest ethical scandals to have hit Facebook in recent years both involved academics, the previous one being the ‘emotional contagion’ experiment, in which it transpired that Facebook had altered newsfeeds without consent, as part of a scientific study. Engaging with external researchers means surrendering a tiny modicum of control. Facebook’s willingness to co-operate with academics is already slight, and these scandals will make Mark Zuckerberg wonder if it could ever be worth the bother. Keep all the data in-house and the question of ethics doesn’t arise. The increasing size and scope of these giant platforms gradually eliminates the need ever to share valuable data with anyone else.","It’s sometimes said that data is the ‘oil’ of the digital economy, the resource that fuels everything else. A more helpful analogy is between oil and privacy, a concealed natural resource that is progressively plundered for private profit, with increasingly harmful consequences for society at large. If this analogy is correct, privacy and data protection laws won’t be enough to fight the tech giants with. Destroying privacy in ever more adventurous ways is what Facebook does.","Just as environmentalists demand that the fossil fuel industry ‘leave it in the ground,’ the ultimate demand to be levelled at Silicon Valley should be ‘leave it in our heads.’ The real villain here is an expansionary economic logic that insists on inspecting ever more of our thoughts, feelings and relationships. The best way to thwart this is the one Silicon Valley fears the most: anti-trust laws. Broken into smaller pieces, these companies would still be able to monitor us, but from disparate perspectives that couldn’t easily (or secretly) be joined up. Better a world full of snake-oil merchants like Cambridge Analytica, who eventually get caught out by their own bullshit, than a world of vast corporate monopolies such as Amazon and Facebook, gradually taking on the functions of government, while remaining eerily quiet about what they’re doing."],"isopubdate":""}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

But apparently, when you’re trying to win a campaign, prostitutes, bribes and spies work pretty well too.","On Monday, Britain’s Channel 4 News ran an explosive exposé of the embattled company. Going undercover as a potential client, its reporter filmed Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, talking about entrapping his clients’ opponents by sending “very beautiful” Ukranian sex workers to their homes. He spoke of offering bribes to candidates while secretly filming them and putting the footage online, of employing fake IDs and bogus websites. Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, described how the company “put information into the bloodstream of the internet” and then watched it spread.","This story came two days after a joint investigation by The New York Times and The Observer of London reported that Cambridge Analytica harvested private information from over 50 million Facebook users without their permission. That, The Times wrote, “allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.”","After days of revelations, there’s still a lot we don’t know about Cambridge Analytica. But we’ve learned that an operation at the heart of Trump’s campaign was ethically nihilistic and quite possibly criminal in ways that even its harshest critics hadn’t suspected. That’s useful information. In weighing the credibility of various accusations made against the president, it’s good to know the depths to which the people around him are willing to sink.","Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica is an offshoot of the SCL Group, a British company that specialized in disinformation campaigns in the developing world. It’s mostly owned by the Mercer family, billionaire right-wing donors and strong Trump supporters. Before becoming the Trump campaign’s chief executive, Steve Bannon was Cambridge Analytica’s vice president. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., also served as an adviser to the company.","Cambridge Analytica shared office space with Trump’s San Antonio-based digital operation, and took substantial credit for its success. “We are thrilled that our revolutionary approach to data-driven communications played such an integral part in President-elect Donald Trump’s extraordinary win,” Nix said in a Nov. 9, 2016, news release.","It’s long been hard to judge how well psychographic profiling actually works. Many consider Cambridge Analytica overrated. Last year, BuzzFeed News reported that former employees said “that despite its sales pitch and public statements, it never provided any proof that the technique was effective or that the company had the ability to execute it on a large scale.” Those who feared that Cambridge Analytica was conducting information warfare on the American people may have been giving the company’s self-serving propaganda too much credence.","But whether or not Cambridge Analytica’s methodology works, the fact that the Trump campaign had a crew of high-tech dirty tricksters on its payroll is significant. We already know that Cambridge Analytica reached out to Julian Assange about finding and disseminating Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails. We know that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has asked the company to turn over documents related to the Trump campaign. Channel Four News plans to air additional undercover footage about Cambridge Analytica’s role in the Trump campaign on Tuesday.","At a minimum, we’ve learned that the Trump campaign’s vaunted social media program was built on deception. Shortly after the 2016 election, Forbes ran an article crediting Jared Kushner for his father-in-law’s shocking triumph. Thanks to digital tools, it said, the traditional presidential campaign was dead, “and Kushner, more than anyone not named Donald Trump, killed it.”","For those who knew something of Kushner’s pre-election career, this portrait of him as some sort of analytics genius was befuddling. The small, gossipy New York newspaper he’d owned, The New York Observer, didn’t even have a particularly good website. “He wasn’t tech-savvy at all,” Elizabeth Spiers, the paper’s former editor in chief, told me.","Cambridge Analytica’s corruption helps provide the missing piece in this story. If the Trump campaign had a social media advantage, one reason is that it hired a company that mined vast amounts of illicitly obtained data.","There’s a lesson here for our understanding of the Trump presidency. Trump and his lackeys have been waging their own sort of psychological warfare on the American majority that abhors them. On the one hand, they act like idiots. On the other, they won, which makes it seem as if they must possess some sort of occult genius. With each day, however, it’s clearer that the secret of Trump’s success is cheating. He, and those around him, don’t have to be better than their opponents because they’re willing to be so much worse."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates.","A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"","Now Playing:","Russian trolls on Facebook apparently sent messages to the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.","Media: Buzz 60","The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information - including the names of users, their \"likes,\" friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work - including a former Cambridge Analytica employee - said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions.","The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates.","Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what \"like\" buttons they had hit.","\"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said.","Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning.","Despite Facebook's concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump's digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user-experience researcher, according to Facebook's public website.","Some critics said Facebook's actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump's campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election.","\"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","Cambridge Analytica - which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president's former senior adviser Stephen Bannon - has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its \"psychometric profiles\" could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters.","\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","The company's actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections.","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy, D, said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Elizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data \"may have been illegally acquired and used.\"","The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. \"It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\" Denham said in a statement.","Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 EU referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee which is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit group.","Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook's processes for dealing with developers who broke the company's rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules - usually because of a story in the news - the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said.","Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers.","Facebook \"relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,\" Parakilas said. \"During my 16 months at the company, I don't recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.\"","Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.","\"Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook's actions on Saturday, including if they ran afoul of their 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.","The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of their agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.","In a statement, Facebook said \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\"","After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry in to U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge's \"psychographic targeting\" techniques - including its use of Facebook data - with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of the Cambridge work.","The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers' likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time.","Cambridge's work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm's data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped.","Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign's data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump's strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.","SCL, Cambridge's parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in \"soft power,\" or persuasion.

The hearing will focus on data privacy and sources inside Facebook say that Zuckerberg will testify.

The CEOs who do attend are sure to be grilled relentlessly by committee members.","The problem actually has to do with the possibility that Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it entered into with the Federal Trade Commission. The decree prevented Facebook from sharing information about subscribers without their permission. Yesterday, the FTC confirmed that it is investigating Facebook.","Zuckerberg has also decided not to testify before a hearing to be held by the British Parliament.

{"originalurl":"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/twitter-google-facebook-cant-show-evidence-russian-meddling/","title":"Despite Senate Demands, Twitter, Google, Facebook Can't Show Evidence of 'Russian Meddling'","text":["Washington, D.C. — (RT) Twitter, Facebook and Google had a hard time providing evidence of “Russian meddling” on social media, transcripts from the US Senate show. However, they did shockingly reveal that RT America had purchased ads aimed at Americans.","On Friday, the US Senate Intelligence Committee released answers provided by Twitter, Facebook and Google in response to questions concerning Russia’s alleged meddlesome use of social media in the devious pursuit of uprooting American democracy.","The Senate’s questions included breathless demands that the tech giants explain why Edward Snowden and Julian Assange are “allowed” to use their services, as well as more mundane requests, such as asking Google if it can confirm crackpot rumors spread by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. However, it turns out the questions were considerably more sensational and accusatory than the tech giants’ responses, which in some cases even raised doubts about the narratives being promoted by the US government and media outlets.","Why does Twitter allow people like Snowden & Assange to have accounts? – curious senator","Tom Cotton, the Republican senator from Arkansas, had by far the most colorful questions for the three tech giants. During his thorough interrogation of Twitter, he asked whether the company’s terms of service prohibit “collaboration with Russian intelligence services to influence an election.” (Twitter reassured the good senator that exerting “artificial influence on an election [is] likely to violate any number of Twitter’s rules and policies.”)","But Cotton’s best moment came when he demanded “justification for allowing entities and individuals such as WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, and Edward Snowden to maintain Twitter accounts.”","Twitter very delicately informed Cotton that “we do not bar controversial figures from our platform or prohibit accounts from posting controversial content … So long as those accounts remain in compliance with our policies, we do not take action against their Tweets or suspend them from the platform.” Undeterred, Cotton asked these same questions to Facebook – and received very similar answers.","RT America bought ads that… ‘focused on’ Americans","In one of the more underwhelming revelations disclosed by the tech giants in the newly-released documents, Twitter reported that “of all of RT’s ad campaigns, 11 were targeted exclusively at English-language speakers, and several others—including all of @RT_America’s seven campaigns—used geographic targeting to focus on US users.”","Twitter also revealed that it had identified nine accounts as being “potentially linked to Russia that promoted election-related, English-language content.” Of these nine nefarious accounts “potentially linked” to Russia, “the most significant use of advertising was by @RT_com and @RT_America. Those two accounts collectively ran 44 different ad campaigns, accounting for nearly all of the relevant advertising we reviewed,” according to Twitter. Once again, Twitter forgot to mention that it pitched a proposal for RT to spend huge sums on advertising for the US presidential election – an offer which RT declined.","However, there is little doubt that before RT was banned from buying Twitter ads, RT America “targeted” Americans.","Facebook can’t trace ‘Russian disinformation campaign’","Senator Mark Warner of Virginia asked Facebook if it could confirm that it was “alerted” by Ukrainian activists and politicians about Russian trolls peddling disinformation on its platform. Unfortunately, Facebook’s response rained on Warner’s anti-Russia parade.","The social media giant explained that most of the “disinformation” reported by Ukrainians was nothing more than Russians calling Ukrainians “khokhol” (a common derogatory term). Facebook also said it received reports of Ukrainians calling Russians “moskal” (another mundane ethnic slur). In some cases, the slurs were deemed hate speech and removed, in accordance with the site’s Community Standards. Facebook was apparently unable to recall any other “Russian misinformation” reported by Ukrainian authorities.","Google questions ‘Ukrainian artillery hack’","In one of many Russia-gate Hail Marys lobbed by Tom Cotton, the Intelligence Committee pressed Google to comment on reports that Russia used malware implanted on Android devices to track Ukrainian artillery units, suggesting that “Russia is not only using your platforms to influence elections, but to gain an advantage on the front lines of a battlefield.”","The question backfired spectacularly, with Google responding: “We are aware of this report and we, although [sic] with others in the industry, have questioned its accuracy.”","The company cited, as one example, that the alleged malware at issue was never distributed through Google’s Play Store.","Scroll on, Russia’s not targeting your FB","Senator Kamala Harris was interested to learn about the types of targeting criteria – “such as demographic, behavioral, lookalike, or email matching” – allegedly used by Russia for its “information operations.” Again, Google’s response did not exactly launch a thousand ships.","“$4,700 of ads attributable to suspected state-sponsored Russian actors were not narrowly targeted to specific groups of users: for example, we found no evidence of targeting by geography (e.g. certain states) or by users’ inferred political preferences (e.g. right or left-leaning),” Google responded. The company added that it was “unaware of any inauthentic accounts linked to Russian information operations flagged by our users.”","Editor’s note: A subheading has been changed to more accurately reflect Tom Cotton’s question for Twitter.","The Free Thought Project wants to continue to spread the ideas of peace and freedom while simultaneously teaching people how to operate outside of the establishment systems of control like using cryptocurrency instead of dollars. Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people.

Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update: Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

It was gathered using a Facebook personality quiz that also took personal data from a user's friends without their knowledge.","Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Facebook reportedly learned of the data breach more than two years ago but did not tell users. Instead, the social media giant told Cambridge Analytica to delete the unauthorized data. The firm claimed it did, but copies of the database still exist.","In 2014, Tillis' campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $30,000, and the North Carolina Republican Party paid $150,000, making the GOP the company's fourth-largest client that year. The party also paid the firm $65,000 in 2015.","\"CA Political was contracted to provide modeled data and data analysis on partisanship, turnout, issue importance and personality profile for North Carolina GOP in the race between Republican Thom Tillis and Democrat Kay Hagan,\" the case study states. \"Harnessing our unique data-rich voter file, we were able to accurately predict partisanship, turnout, issue importance and build psychographic profiles for all voters in North Carolina. We produced clusters of voters based on the modeled data to maximize campaign impact, which enabled the creation of tailored messages directed at those audiences.\"","Those messages went out, according to the case study, in the form of direct mail and get-out-the-vote calls to more than 128,000 voters, increasing turnout by more than 12 percent.","Tillis defeated Hagan by fewer than 50,000 votes following a campaign marked by one negative ad after another on both sides.","Cambridge Analytica's third-largest client in 2014, the John Bolton SuperPAC, was also highly active in the Tillis/Hagan race, spending nearly $1.5 million to benefit Tillis and damage Hagan. The super-PAC spent $341,000 with the company for messaging consulting.","Tillis didn't respond Monday to repeated requests for comment on the allegations against Cambridge Analytica’s methods. Republican 10th District Congressman Patrick McHenry, whose campaign also spent $15,000 on Cambridge Analytica’s services in 2014, also didn't respond to requests for comment.","Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the state Republican Party, said the party uses the Republican National Committee for voter data and never used Cambridge Analytica for that purpose.","\"The vendor in question was one of several contracted to do work on the party's direct mail program. The company was not hired and did not do social media work for the party,\" Woodhouse, who didn't work for the GOP in 2014, said in an email. \"They have not been engaged in nearly four years, and there are no plans to use the company in the future. Any vendor that operated in less than a transparently ethical manner is forbidden from future work.\"","Still, North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin said the new revelations raise a lot of questions about what the GOP, Tillis or McHenry knew about Cambridge Analytica, what they asked the firm to do and when they found out about its connections to Russia.","\"I don't know if it had any direct impact but it certainly was a trial run for what happened in 2016 here in the elections across our country,\" Goodwin said. \"I would never have thought that North Carolina would have been the guinea pig for this type of activity.\"","President Donald Trump used Cambridge Analytica in his general election campaign in 2016.","The company is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon.

Even if you don’t use WhatsApp, if any of your friends have your phone number in their address book, then Facebook has that as WhatsApp harvests each user’s address book. So, your friends can share your data/phone number and you’ll never know.\"","It's unclear at this point whether this specific breach will impact the company's advertising business over the long-run, but eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said it is something for advertisers to be cautious about.","\"This specific incident is not likely to cause advertisers to leave Facebook, but it will cause them to think twice about how data about Facebook’s users is handled,\" Williamson told Fox News. \"Facebook’s advertising system depends on user data, and it has used that data to develop targeted advertising capabilities that are better than any other company can offer. If Facebook were forced to change the way it uses data or the way its ad products work, then advertisers may become less enamored with it.\"","The research firm said it expects worldwide ad spending on Facebook to grow 22 percent in 2018, reaching $48.85 billion, accounting for nearly 18 percent of all global digital advertising.","The company has come under fire from lawmakers after it announced over the weekend it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, which has ties to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.","In Washington, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee told ABC News' \"This Week\" that Cambridge Analytica's work deserved further scrutiny by the panel.","\"We need to find out what we can about the misappropriation of the privacy, the private information of tens of millions of Americans,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said.","Schiff pointed out that the committee had only done one interview with Alexander Nix, the head of the U.K.-based firm. \"Even then it was by a video conference at the GOP's insistence,\" he said.","In a separate statement, Schiff said Facebook must \"answer important questions about why it provided private user information to an academic, how they have informed users in advance of these kinds of data transfers, and whether it can demonstrate that this data has indeed been destroyed. They must also answer questions about how they have notified users about this breach of their personal data.\"","Sen.

{"originalurl":"https://bohatala.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-executive-ethics/","title":"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Executive Ethics | Criticism | Bohatala","text":["Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Executive Ethics","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Executive Ethics","A description of the subject’s ethical beliefs and practices","Mark Zuckerberg is undoubtedly on of the youngest Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) that the modern age has witnessed rise to the helm of a global corporation. Facebook might not present the best case study with regard to ethical practices but a mention of the youthful founder and CEO could attract some rare attention that the topic needs. Some of the reasons that make Zuckerberg a special mention in various spheres of corporate management are his massive impact on the social network industry as well as criticism that he continues to face in his tenure at Facebook. His executive roles in terms of ethical interpretation seem to have a rare following with a mixture of reactions that have apparently been masked by the success that the corporation has made. In tracing Zuckerberg’s track record as an ethical CEO, this discourse displays the two sides of the youthful Facebook icon. This section deals with a description of his ethical beliefs and practices at the helm of the leading social network.","At Facebook, the corporation picture of professionalism is boosted by the founder’s belief that amassing the best professionally capable human resource will salvage the chances of operations. According to the executive approach that the CEO has adopted over the years, a very stable team of managers can only enable the corporation to rise from strength to strength. This is evidenced by the choice of his vice president and other top managers who have a rich history in dealing with corporate affairs. In view of the implication that the choices of the management team that Zuckerberg chose, we can draw an inference that he prefers professionalism in handling of corporate management at Facebook. The fortunes of the company on a backdrop of controversies illustrate an internal strength that professionalism accords Facebook.","Under Zuckerberg’s tenure, Facebook’s corporate responsibility has evolved to keep in touch with the changing business environment. By facilitating one of the most time-progressive policies which acknowledges keeping up with the pace of environmental issues, Zuckerberg paints an image of a CEO who is conscious of ethical principle of corporate social responsibility. Facebook does not only lead in the pack for the campaign to promote climate change responsive agenda, it actually implements on of the most progressive green energy projects at its server facilities. Such community minded leadership is only made fruitful by the contributions of a youthful CEO under the guidance of some ethical principles.","In a separate perspective about Facebook, has been able to handle global mixture in traditions without a major concern due to its application of universal business values. Since inception, Zuckerberg has been a believer in diversity of the international market and the effective identification of neutrality in business values has seen the assimilation of the entire global market without trouble. In applying a neutral ground, for instance facilitation of several global languages in the Facebook interface has assisted in assimilation of every quarter of business without major communication hitches. Zuckerberg is therefore depicted as an executive office who responds to the most pressing issues of market diversity in the most ethical manner. Similarly, the CEO applies basic rules of ethics by not imposing such values as religion on the basic interface, which appears as an ethical stride in performing business with his customers.","An Analysis of the Subject’s Ethics","As mentioned before, there has been some significant amount of criticism from different circles regarding the competence of Zuckerberg as an ethical business executive. Since a reasonable hearing on such an account needs a presentation of the appropriate facts to be weighed out for the determinative conclusion, a presentation of unethical facts from Zuckerberg’s regime is necessary. In this segment therefore, the antagonists’ account of arguments is visited to substantiate a case of his unethical behavior at the helm of Facebook management.","Perhaps the most publicized undoing of Zuckerberg’s style of management is in the manner in which he handled privacy violation cases of Facebook clients. Very weighty scandals implicating Zuckerberg by infringing on the rights of customers’ privacy have certainly stained his reputation that a CEO of his caliber ought to have (Ali and Keenan 2009). According to the authors, the young CEO violated the basic ethical provision that the Facebook fraternity expected of him particularly in dealing with Beacon advertising. Having outlined a clearly laid out security platform for Facebook users, the management of the corporation must have given the client base enough assurances regarding its privacy during Facebook usage.","However, following the unbecoming and unethical behavior of the top most office of the corporation, a serious compromise of the earlier given assurances happened. Due to the isolation of the person that Zuckerberg was depicted in the scenario, there were no major cases of exodus of clients from the social network. Serious implications however had to be met by certain sections of the engagement such as the change of name by Beacon to Social Ads. The implication of such changes in a company could be far reaching bearing the sensitive nature of the online industry that is full of competitive drama. In any case, the client base continued to swell amid such allegations of a top official at the corporation. The damage had been done and apparently, the issuance of an apology by Zuckerberg sounded like a mockery of the trust that users had placed on the assurances given by Facebook.","According to Ben and McGrath (2010), there are several risks of transparency exposed to the society in the design and usage of Facebook since its original launch. The authors reckon that it is the role of the corporate world running such platforms as the social networks to protect the transparency of the networks and mitigate risks involved for its violation. Zuckerberg’s original intention of leaving loopholes in disclosive ethics is represented as an ethical weakness since some users can easily go around the basic disclosure morals and take advantage of other unsuspecting users. Zuckerberg is once again portrayed as a weak executive office who cannot command enough respect for the protection of the security of Facebook users. Some critics would be forgiven if they linked his hacking episode of Beacon’s account to this lenience towards ethical disclosure.","In a rare mention of network ethics that network based proprietors must particularly withhold, Melé (2009, p987) demonstrates how the important element of justice Zuckerberg’s attempts to have a peaceful rein at Facebook. In a separate account of a court proceeding involving the copyright issue of Facebook idea, Zuckerberg terribly fails to demonstrate the author’s emphasis of justice in business as proprietors and executives ought to observe. By engaging in a legal tussle by the Winklevoss twin brothers over the founding rights of Facebook, Zuckerberg’s credentials as high class officer observing justice are deeply tainted (Bolduc, 2011). Although Zuckerberg offered for an outside-court settlement to the twin brothers, it follows that the case acts against his image as business ethics demand (Newkirk and Viehauser, 2008).","In my own opinion, the unwarranted unethical engagements that the CEO makes as an individual drags the entire business into disrepute which damages the opportunities that lie in its success path. Some of the reasons why Zuckerberg acted unethically cannot be substantiated and leaves many questions than answers regarding his ethical conduct as a high profile executive. Perhaps his young and inexperienced age could be his greatest undoing; with age advancement, maybe he will find it appropriate to act more responsibly from informed experience as a CEO. This is not supposed to imply that all young entrepreneurs would be as ineffective to the extent that Zuckerberg finds himself."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

{"originalurl":"https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2018/03/17/facebook-will-carry-health-warning-within-five-years/","title":"Facebook will carry a health warning within five years","text":["About TNW","TNW Sites","Facebook will carry a health warning within five years","I predict that in five years time, Facebook will carry a health warning.","Of course, this is an outrageous prediction, but watching the fiddling going on at Facebook and other online giants while their empires burn, it’s clear they must instigate significant changes before regulators impose new controls. I don’t think that Facebook will carry a health warning not because it’s particularly bad for your health, but because it’s failing to learn the lessons of the past and come up with adequate responses to criticism","There are two main reasons. One, like many giant tech companies before it, it has allowed hubris to lull its executive team into the belief that it’s untouchable; that the overall good it’s offering outweighs the damaging consequences. That’s why Facebook felt it could enter the Indian market with a “free” internet offering that only provided access via its own social network. Unsurprisingly, it was roundly rejected by all sides in India.","Despite its mea culpa about failing to control fake news, extremist and bigoted content it has continued to profit from advertising connected to such posts. It has taken too long to accept it’s not operating in the best interests of its two billion plus monthly users worldwide.","The statements from its spokespeople have too often been guarded and vanilla giving the appearance that its lawyers are more central to its strategy than its technologists. And it has exuded the belief that its size will protect it, because it is simply too important to economies in every corner of the globe.","Facebook’s existential crisis","The litany of criticism from politicians, pressure groups, and media have proven it’s no longer immune. Indeed, I would argue the crisis facing Facebook is even more fundamental to the technology industry than the collapse and rebirthing process of Uber.","Don’t get me wrong I am glad Uber has been made an example of and it should serve as a warning that such behavior is no longer accepted. However, the challenges for Zuckerberg are more fundamental, because they risk undermining the company’s core business.","If regulators require it to strip out unsavory content and provide guarantees it’s not profiting from related advertising, then it throws its revenue model into question. If how the company tracks customers — and non-customers — must change, then it will no longer be able to assure advertisers of the same level of personalization; a central tenet of its sales pitch.","This existential crisis should not come as a surprise. We’ve been here before with Google, Intel, and Microsoft. The Microsoft “run-in” with US and European regulators was a major event at the time and has had a very significant impact on the company’s reputation ever since; indeed, I would go as far as to say the investigations surrounding Internet Explorer stirred up a storm that it is only just now dying down.","Ironically, Microsoft has been able to brush off some of those past negative perceptions, because it has been prepared to radically alter its business model; namely shifting from owning and selling proprietary software to embracing open source alongside its own products.","Facebook has a similar existential threat. The only way it can placate its critics is if it’s prepared to accept a radically different approach to its business model. If the social media giant refuses to see itself as a media company, then it must accept that it is a consumer product similar to those you would see in your supermarket.","This is why it will — eventually — accept a health warning as a way of educating users and protecting itself from excessive regulatory scrutiny. If Facebook cannot block illegal content and have the mechanisms in place to ensure the voracity of user generated content, then it will have to advise users about the potential limitations of what they are viewing and reading.","Clearly, this could have consequences for its relationship with users, who will make choices about whether they view Facebook as a trusted source; this alone could significantly impact its business. Yet if it does not take this step, it’s hard to see how it will remain beyond the reach of international regulators.","However, carrying a health warning will not be enough and Facebook should turn to next generation internet technologies to redefine its proposition. Ultimately, Facebook will have to redefine its relationship with its customers and this should include giving them more rights over whether they opt-in to the content and adverts they are seeing.","That would require giving users far more control of their data and potentially even rewarding users for access to their data. Ironically, Zuckerberg referenced this when he admitted that today’s internet is more centralized than ever before, a far cry from its original decentralized principles.","Getting back to decentralization","If Facebook wanted to return control to users, it could do so by returning to these original concepts. The decentralized web is producing far more innovation and a real movement for change in how we interact with online companies. A much more positive, and braver decision for Facebook, would be to embrace the decentralized web and become its champion; just as Satya Nadella did when he turned his back on Steve Ballmer’s venomous statement that Linux was a cancer.","Taking this approach would lead to a far more equitable version of the shared economy than the one we have today and could (long-term) incentivize more users to engage with the network. Naturally, it could dent Facebook’s traditional revenue model, but what if it adopted a crypto-currency? Zuckerberg appears to be exploring this idea already, but who does he have in mind to benefit from the rewards of such a currency?","There’s also a well-worn argument that the blockchain could ensure transactions are immutable and for Facebook this could mean that the ultimate sources of content could be more traceable. More importantly, though, it could become a mechanism which allows Facebook to reward its users for access to their data. This would create a far more mutually beneficial relationship and force the social network giant to work harder to keep customers with its network.","The key challenge is that any change must be embraced throughout the organization and not just be seen as the annual pet project of the CEO. Microsoft failed to recognize (or ignored) the warning signs for many years and I would argue this cost it in reputational terms for nearly 30 years. It’s only just back on track now. Facebook can learn the lessons of the technology industry’s past and by embracing the potential of the decentralized web it can turn a crisis to its advantage."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

We Should Act Like It. | Long Beach Business Journal","text":["Millennial Pulse: Our Data Is Currency. We Should Act Like It.","Unofficial Millennial-In-Chief Mark Zuckerberg appeared stony-faced and characteristically awkward under the spotlight on CNN last week as he answered to the fallout of a whistleblower’s story that the data of more than 50 million Facebook users had been compromised and perhaps used to influence the 2016 presidential election.","As he sheepishly explained how a personality quiz application on his social media network started it all, I marveled at how CNN Tech Correspondent Laurie Segall somehow managed not to roll her eyes with the rest of America.","I had to laugh. Of course, 300,000 people had signed away their information (and that of all their friends, and friends’ friends, and so on) just so some online application they knew nothing about could give some validation of their own sense of self. Of course. Because the rise of social media has coincided with two toxic trends: an insufferable need for instant validation or inclusion, and a corresponding willingness to throw privacy out the window to get it.","Just think about how many people in your Facebook feed, each day, post results of personality quizzes. Want to know which Harry Potter character you are? What your Myers-Briggs profile is? No problem. Just blithely check the box that allows a company you’ve never heard of access to everything you’ve ever posted on your Facebook page, like all those pictures of your kids, every place you’ve been in the past year, your political views, your e-mail address, what you ate for breakfast on February 9, 2011, and on and on. No big deal, right?","The thing about “free” applications, whether they are games on your smartphone or quiz apps on Facebook, is that they’re really not free. If you absentmindedly skip past the terms of agreement (as many of us do), you’re not even aware that you’re paying to play – but your currency isn’t actual money. It’s your data.","The lures used to convince people to sign over their personal data typically play into natural human instincts that drive behavior across social media: the need to fit in, to share common experiences, to connect with others. For example, if all your friends are suddenly using customized emojis that look like them, would you be tempted to download the app, too? I have to admit I fell for that one, until, days after installing it, a pop-up told me that I needed to download a special keyboard to use the emojis. The catch? The app developer would have access to everything I typed and sent in text messages. It would have been like willingly allowing a privately run version of the NSA access to my phone. I deleted the app.","As I wrote this, I decided to check out which apps have access to my data and discovered I had unwittingly allowed several quiz apps access to my Facebook profile information. Oops. Guess I’ll have to trade in my high horse for a miniature steed.","Obviously, it’s not just Millennials signing their information away to retailers, tech firms, advertisers and, apparently, politically motivated data research firms with ties to presidential campaigns (that’s a Cambridge Analytica reference for those of you who haven’t turned on the news in a week). But when you think about the rise of social media – of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. – which generation is always given the most credit (and criticism) for integrating those platforms into our lives?","As the first generation to come of age in the era of widespread Internet access, Millennials’ online behaviors have more than once been studied in relation to their feelings about data sharing and privacy.","A 2016 Gallup poll found that, while the majority (67%) of Millennials trust their primary bank to safeguard their personal data, far fewer trust basically every other kind of organization. For example: only one quarter of Millennials trusted cellphone platforms to safeguard their data, and just 19% said they trusted the federal government with their digital information.","However, the Gallup poll found that Millennials place more trust in companies to keep their information private than did older generations: 44% of Millennials said they trusted companies to keep their information private all or most of the time, while only 32% of Gen X-ers and Baby Boomers said the same.","An analysis of data privacy research by eMarketer, an international research firm, found that Millennials were far more comfortable than the general population with their phones tracking their habits, ranging from location to spending to physical activity. The company also found that Millennials were three times more likely than people aged 65 and older to share such personal information with their favorite retailers.","After the revelation that Facebook signed away the right to tens of millions of people’s data with little more than a promise that it would solely be used for academic research purposes, only for that data to be manipulated by a firm working for a presidential campaign, we have to be savvier.","If our data is being used as currency, we need to treat it as such. Think about it this way. Would you give Facebook all the money in your checking account so you can find out which Hogwarts house you belong to?","If the answer is yes, let me save you the time. You’re a squib.","And if you don’t know or care what that means, you’re probably one step ahead of the rest of us."],"isopubdate":""}

Now. - The Washington Post","text":["Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg need to come clean about 2016. Now.","Over the weekend, the New York Times and the Observer of London posted a blockbuster investigative piece revealing that Cambridge Analytica, the firm brought on by the Trump campaign to target voters online, used the data of tens of millions of people obtained from Facebook without proper disclosures or permission.","In the wake of this report, it’s more than past time for Mark Zuckerberg to testify to Congress about Facebook’s role in the 2016 elections and why he believes existing privacy laws are adequate to protect Americans from misuse and abuse of technology platforms.","And I mean Mark Zuckerberg. Not a Facebook lawyer, like the one the company sent to Congress last year for hearings on how fake news swamped tech platforms such as, oh, Facebook. As Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) tweeted:","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The investigation published by the Times revealed that Cambridge Analytica, after receiving $15 million from conservative donor Robert Mercer in 2014 to micro-target voters, obtained the information to do so in a questionable way. A British professor collected the information from Facebook, saying he was conducting an academic personality study. He did get the approval of about 270,000 people who signed up to take part in the study — they were told their information would be used. He did not, however, get the permission of the users’ friends, whose information was also gathered — an estimated 50 million people.","It’s not just that such an action is unethical. It might well be a violation of an agreement Facebook made with the federal government. Two former employees of the Federal Trade Commission have now told The Post that it’s quite possible that Facebook violated a 2011 agreement with the agency to notify and offer users an out when there is an effort to use their personal information in a way not in line with their privacy settings. This agreement was reached after consumer groups complained that Facebook was cavalier with personal information.","So back to Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook found out, courtesy of a 2015 piece in the Guardian, that Cambridge Analytica and British academics had information on many users that agreed to such a collection, it demanded the information be destroyed. This did not happen. Facebook cited this when pressed on the latest revelations by the Times, claiming that the companies that misused the data “certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","(On Monday afternoon, Facebook announced that Cambridge Analytica agreed to a digital audit to prove it destroyed the disputed materials. The professors involved in using the data also agreed to an audit.)","And so, after the Times published its piece, Facebook didn’t own up to what happened. Instead, Facebook executives have gotten into a multiplespats with reporters and others over whether the Cambridge Analytica incident is a “breach” or a mere misuse of personal information, since some (but not all!) the people whose data was involved did give permission for their data to be taken and the company was not actually hacked. Facebook’s motive for this is almost certainly legal and regulatory. As Bloomberg News notes, a “breach” is a specific term that requires the company to notify users their information was illegally accessed.","But there is quite possibly a bigger motive. Painting Cambridge Analytica as the villain is an attempt to get Facebook off the hook for its ongoing role in everything from other invasions of privacy (more about that in a moment) to the ongoing complaints about its role in spreading fake news in the 2016 elections. If one or two rogue companies such as Cambridge Aanlytica — and not Facebook — are responsible for this mass misuse of data, perhaps the company can say more regulation is not needed.","But don’t fall for the idea that Facebook is not the problem. This is hardly a first-time offense for Facebook, which — a reminder — allowed fake news to flood many users’ news feeds in the months leading up to the 2016 elections.","In fact, Washington perhaps should have gotten interested in Facebook well before the Trump election contretemps. Over time, Facebook has indulged in numerous instances of dodgy behavior. There was the time Facebook altered news feeds to study whether they could affect the mood of people on the platform. There was the reveal that its platform permitted ad buyers to target people with such delightful terms as “jew hater.” And the discovery that Facebook made it possible to target housing ads to whites only.","Whether this latest scandal was a breach or a misuse of information is irrelevant. It was wrong. Zuckerberg needs to explain — slowly and clearly and without legal terminology or whiny excuses — what went wrong at the company he founded in his Harvard dorm room, and what steps the company is taking to make sure it never happens again. My suspicion? He can’t do that. Instead, a Zuckerberg appearance will demonstrate the need for significant federal regulation of large technology platforms.

(Hendrik Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images)","With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve.","THE BIG IDEA:","PALO ALTO, Calif. — When historian Niall Ferguson moved from Harvard to Stanford two years ago, he was struck by Silicon Valley’s indifference to history. The hubris he saw reminded him of what he encountered on Wall Street as he researched a book about the history of banking during the years before the financial crisis. He became convinced the technology sector was careening toward its own crisis and decided to write about it.","The crisis has finally arrived, thanks to Cambridge Analytica, conveniently timed to coincide with the publication of Ferguson’s new book on the history of social networks, from the Freemasons to Facebook. “The Square and the Tower” is a cautionary tale that challenges the conventional wisdom that growing interconnectedness is inherently good for society. “Our networked world is fundamentally vulnerable, and two-factor authentication won’t save us,” Ferguson said at the Hoover Institution, where he is a senior fellow.","Since President Trump’s victory, much has been written about parallels between the present and the rise of authoritarian leaders in the 1930s. Ferguson thinks that’s lazy analysis. For most of the 20th century, communications systems were amenable to central control. This was a fluke of the Industrial Revolution, which produced telegraphs and then telephones. These technologies had an architecture that allowed whoever controlled the hub to dominate the spokes, which led to more hierarchical power structures.","To understand the current era, Ferguson believes we need to look more at what happened after Johannes Gutenberg developed the printing press. Like the Web, the use of these presses was difficult to centrally control. “At the beginning of the Reformation 501 years ago, Martin Luther thought naively that if everybody could read the Bible in the vernacular, they’d have a direct relationship with God, it would create ‘the priesthood of all believers’ and everything would be awesome,” Ferguson said.","“We’ve said the same things about the Internet,” he added. “We think that's obviously a good idea. Except it's not obviously a good idea, any more than it was in the 16th century. Because what the Europeans had was not ‘the priesthood of all believers.’ They had 130 years of escalating religious conflict, culminating in the Thirty Years War — one of the most destructive conflicts ever.”","The more he studies that period, the more echoes Ferguson sees in the 21st century. “What one can see in the 16th and 17th centuries is polarization, fake news-type stories, the world getting smaller and therefore contagion is capable of spreading much faster,” Ferguson said. “These big shifts in network structure led to revolutions against hierarchical institutions.”","Ferguson points to recent studies showing that fake news can spread faster and farther than real news when it’s especially sensational. “The crazy stuff is more likely to go viral because we're kind of interested in crazy stuff, but this is not surprising historically,” he said. “The idea that witches live amongst us and should be burned went as viral as anything that Martin Luther said ... Indeed, it turned out that witch burning was more likely to happen in places where there were more printing presses.”","In a sobering 90-minute conversation, the author said he’s driven to sleeplessness when he thinks about how some of the dynamics on social media will play out in the future. “I'm much more worried than a non-historian by what I see because history tells me that the polarization process keeps going, and it doesn't just stop at verbal violence because at a certain point that's not satisfying,” Ferguson said.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg meets with a group of entrepreneurs in St. Louis last November. (Jeff Roberson/AP)","Enter Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is worth around $64 billion as a 33-year-old because of his brilliance at creating an addictive social network that capitalized on the human desire for connection. The site was already embattled for allowing the Kremlin to use its platform to sow domestic discord. The Russians were literally buying political ads to target American voters with rubles. Now Zuckerberg is under growing scrutiny for the firm’s failure to safeguard data in the wake of damning whistleblower revelations about Cambridge Analytica, a voter profiling firm which harvested the personal information of as many as 50 million users and earned $6 million from President Trump’s 2016 campaign.","The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook broke the law or violated a 2011 settlement agreement. A bipartisan chorus in Congress is demanding that Zuckerberg testify under oath. His lobbyists are negotiating the details of an appearance. Recognizing the political risk, Facebook executives have even begun saying publicly that they’re receptive to being more heavily regulated.","“I don’t think they have thought deeply at all about the historical significance of their predicament, and I blame Mark Zuckerberg for dropping out of Harvard before he took any of my classes,” Ferguson quipped. “If he had taken my course in western civilization, he'd know that he's become a strange amalgam of John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst all at once. When you look back on the experience of these figures, what's the common characteristic? They went through a phase of deep unpopularity.”","Ferguson, who like Carnegie is a native of Scotland, believes that the American government must move aggressively to rein in the power of companies like Facebook. “If we don't act, the next phase of the process will be even uglier than the current Cambridge Analytica phase — which is the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “Think of how many other people have downloaded the data. The window was open for years.”","He believes Facebook should be treated under the law more like a content publisher than a technology company. Amending the Telecommunications Act of 1996 could increase their liability and make them more accountable for damaging information trafficked on their platforms. “It is an untenable state of affairs that a few private companies know more about the citizens of a country than the citizens themselves, much less the government,” said Ferguson. “And it is untenable that the companies concerned are … so easily instrumentalized by hostile foreign governments that as many people saw Russian-originated content in 2016 as voted in the presidential election. Regardless of where you are on the political spectrum, you cannot possibly think this is okay.”","Despite all the attention paid to the ongoing Russia probes, Ferguson thinks media coverage of the midterms needs to emphasize how vulnerable the Internet remains to manipulation by the forces of darkness. “It's as if people who work professionally in politics just want to pretend that it's still pre-2008, whereas the entire system of politics has completely changed,” he said. “Facebook advertising is the most powerful tool in politics. I don't think we're doing nearly enough to avoid another legitimacy crisis around this.”","-- Kim Jong Un did meet with the Chinese president in Beijing, Chinese and North Korea state media confirmed. The “unofficial visit” is believed to be Kim's first trip abroad since coming to power in 2011. Emily Rauhala reports: “In Washington, [Sarah Huckabee Sanders] said that the Chinese government had briefed the Trump administration about the visit …The Trump administration sees the development ‘as further evidence that our campaign of maximum pressure is creating the appropriate atmosphere for dialogue … ’ [Sanders added]. Kim is expected to meet [South Korean President Moon Jae-in] next month, and is in discussions about talks with Trump … \"","-- Trump tweeted about his planned meeting with Kim this morning:","For years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility.

David J. Lynch writes: “South Korea agreed to limit its steel exports to the United States, a key U.S. goal, and take several steps to open its auto market to American companies. In return, Trump agreed to exempt South Korea from his new 25 percent tariff on imported steel. But threatening negotiating partners with tariffs unless they make concessions, as the United States did with South Korea, is not President Trump’s innovation. It is a tactic that Washington often used before the creation of the World Trade Organization, though one that did little to reduce the bilateral trade deficits that preoccupy the president. It also may prove a riskier strategy when U.S. negotiators take on more-powerful countries, including China … ”","-- Stormy Daniel’s attorney is seeking to depose Trump about his knowledge of an alleged $130,000 payout to the adult-film star. Derek Hawkins reports: “In documents filed early Wednesday morning, Michael Avenatti said he was seeking to depose Trump and [his lawyer Michael] Cohen for no more than two hours each to find out whether Trump was aware of the agreement and whether he consented to it. Avenatti requested the court hold a hearing on the matter on April 30.

It has raised questions, too, about what’s being done to restore order at the agency after weeks of turmoil have left little doubt that Shulkin … is next to go in what’s become a pronounced leadership shake-up. What’s befallen Shulkin is a favorite tactic of Trump’s, who followed a similar approach with [Rex Tillerson and H.R.

John Hudson reports: “In his new job, Bolton will not directly oversee the State Department, but his powerful perch [will] offer opportunities to shape and influence policy and personnel at Foggy Bottom. Bolton’s advisers and former colleagues say he has a good relationship with [secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo]. But they said Bolton is unlikely to take a back seat to the former Kansas congressman on the issues he cares about most: Iran and North Korea … How Bolton will fit into a combustible Cabinet ecosystem of strong personalities … is unclear, but contemporaries of Bolton said he should not be underestimated.Individuals close to Bolton said they [expect] him to ‘clear house’ at the NSC and remove staffers viewed as allies of H.R.

Josh Rogin writes: “The Trump administration has not done enough to respond to Russia’s attack on the United States and our democratic institutions, Bolton said [last month at the Daniel Morgan Graduate School of National Security], and Putin must pay a heavy price for his actions. … The United States should respond in ‘cyberspace and elsewhere,’ Bolton said, suggesting offensive action against the Russian operatives that perpetrated the interference. Only if the response is overwhelming will Russia and other countries be deterred. … But Bolton doesn’t want Trump to stop there. As he explained during his extensive remarks, the United States should also push back on a range of Kremlin transgressions: its support for Syria, its alliance with Iran, its undermining of North Korea sanctions, and its coordination with China to thwart the West.”","-- White House budget director Mick Mulvaney is poised to get greater control over Treasury Department regulations. Politico’s Nancy Cook and Aaron Lorenzo report: “The move, which could come in the next few weeks, would end the autonomy the Treasury Department has enjoyed since the 1980s when it comes to issuing tax rules, while giving greater power to one of Trump’s favorite Cabinet members at the expense of another.

Josh Dawsey and Mike DeBonis report: “Trump has told advisers that he was spurned in a large spending bill last week when lawmakers appropriated only $1.6 billion for the border wall. He has suggested to [Defense Secretary Jim Mattis] and congressional leaders that the Pentagon could fund the sprawling project, citing a ‘national security’ risk. After floating the notion to several advisers last week, Trump told [Paul Ryan] that the military should pay for the wall[.] Ryan offered little reaction to the idea … but senior Capitol Hill officials later said it was an unlikely prospect. In another interaction with senior aides last week, Trump noted that the Defense Department was getting so much money as part of the spending bill that the Pentagon could surely afford the border wall … The Pentagon has plenty of money, but reprogramming it for a wall would require votes in Congress that the president does not seem to have. Taking money from the 2018 budget for the wall would require an act of Congress[.]”","Sarah Huckabee Sanders deflected a question about using dedicated military funds for the wall: “I can’t get into the specifics of that at this point, but I can tell you that the continuation of building the wall is ongoing, and we’re going to continue moving forward in that process,” she told reporters.","-- The administration’s decision to add a census question on citizenship has sparked political and legal backlash, mostly recently from New York, which promised a “multistate” lawsuit challenging the policy. From Seung Min Kim and Tara Bahrampour: “[T]here is little [Democratic lawmakers] can do to immediately counter the move. The massive spending bill lawmakers passed last week would have been the best chance the minority party had this year to try to block the Census Bureau from moving forward with its plan, with congressional Republicans so far showing little appetite to protest the decision. The confrontation becomes another key factor hanging in the balance in the upcoming midterm elections, with Democrats gaining considerable leverage to scrap the census decision should they win control of either chamber.”","-- CNN’s Harry Enten crunched the numbers to find out how blue states would be affected by the citizenship question: “According to the 2016 American Community Survey, there are 13 million non-citizens living in states (and Washington DC) won by Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. There are only about 9.5 million non-citizens living in states won by Republican Donald Trump. In other words, about 58% of non-citizens live in Clinton states and 42% live in Trump states. These percentages, however, undersell the political impact to blue states. The vast majority of the states to be impacted are blue states. Clinton-won states make up 76% of the states where there are more non-citizens than the average state to Trump's 24%. …","“California and blue states in general could definitely lose seats in Congress too if non-citizens (here legally or illegally) are afraid to answer the Census. Let's say every non-citizen were afraid to answer Census. That's unlikely to happen, but it gives you a good idea of the stakes. … The 2016 American Community Survey suggests California could lose up to four seats in Congress in such a scenario. No other state would lose more than one.”","-- Trump terminated deportation protections for 4,000 Liberians, who first received temporary protected status 27 years ago. From USA Today’s Alan Gomez: “Liberians were first granted TPS in March 1991 under former President George H.W. Bush due to armed conflicts that were gripping the country. Starting in 1999, Liberians were transferred into a separate program called Deferred Enforced Departure, a classification that allowed them to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation. That status was approved several times by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama as the country grappled with a civil war, ongoing armed conflicts, and an outbreak of the Ebola virus. But on Tuesday, after consulting with the departments of State and Homeland Security, Trump concluded that those conditions had been largely resolved. Liberians will have 12 months to get their affairs in order and return to their home country.”","-- The Orange County Sheriff’s Department is moving to sidestep California State Bill 54, which restricts communication between federal immigration authorities and local law enforcement. Alex Horton reports: “[The sheriff’s office said] it would put the date an inmate will be released on its website. ‘This action will enhance communication between the Sheriff’s Department and our law enforcement partners to remove dangerous offenders from our community,’ the department said in a statement … But critics say the measure will cast too wide a net and hand ICE information on the whereabouts of undocumented immigrants who may never be charged with a crime.”","Christopher Steele.

The New York Times’s Nicholas Confessore and Matthew Rosenberg report: “It was a Palantir employee in London, working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge’s psychological profiling technology, who suggested the scientists create their own app — a mobile-phone-based personality quiz — to gain access to Facebook users’ friend networks, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. Cambridge ultimately took a similar approach. By early summer, the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app.”","-- Christopher Steele, the former MI6 officer who wrote the Trump dossier, provided the FBI with another secret report that claimed Vladimir Putin’s former media czar was beaten to death at a D.C. hotel in 2015. This directly contradicts the U.S. government’s official finding that Mikhail Lesin died by “accident.” BuzzFeed News reports Lesin died “on the eve of a scheduled meeting with US Justice Department officials. They had planned to interview Lesin about the inner workings of RT, the Kremlin-funded network that he founded. … The Steele report is not the FBI's only source for this account of Lesin's death: Three other people, acting independently … said they also told the FBI that Lesin had been bludgeoned to death by enforcers working for the same oligarch named by Steele.”","-- The dearth of top talent on Trump’s legal team has led to the promotion of a little-known former prosecutor, Reuters’s Karen Freifeld reports. “Andrew Ekonomou, 69, is one of a handful of lawyers assisting Jay Sekulow, the main attorney representing Trump in [Mueller’s] investigation. .... Sekulow said Ekonomou, who works under contract as an assistant district attorney in Brunswick, Georgia, was a ‘brilliant strategist’ who has handled complex investigations for decades. Ekonomou assisted Sekulow in a famous case involving the religious group Jews for Jesus before the Supreme Court in the 1980s. While Ekonomou has also worked on criminal matters, he has not handled cases as high-profile and complex as the Mueller probe.”","-- A bipartisan pair of senators who wrote a bill meant to protect Mueller’s investigation issued a statement urging Trump not to interfere with the special counsel. Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) said: “This should not be a partisan issue. … We urge President Trump to allow the Special Counsel to complete his work without impediment, which is in the best interest of the American people, the President, and our nation.” (Politico)","-- Robert Mueller’s team claimed in a court filing it has connected Rick Gates to a person with Russian intelligence ties. CNN’s Katelyn Polantz reports: “That Gates and the unnamed person, who had lived in Kiev and Moscow and worked for one of Paul Manafort's companies, were in touch in September and October 2016 was ‘pertinent to the investigation,’ [the court filing said]. The acknowledgment that Gates knew the person had Russian intelligence ties is alleged in a report prosecutors filed about the coming sentencing of [Dutch attorney Alex van der Zwaan]. … [Van der Zwaan] pleaded guilty last month to lying to [Mueller's] investigators about his interactions with Gates and the unnamed person.”","-- Paul Manafort is asking for 18 criminal charges against him in Virginia to be thrown out. From Spencer S. Hsu: “Manafort’s attorneys in January and again in a longer, 38-page filing Tuesday argued that acting attorney general Rod J.

(Reuters)","FLORIDA FALLOUT:","-- Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a New York Times op-ed arguing for the repeal of the Second Amendment: “Concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states led to the adoption of that amendment, which provides that ‘a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.’ Today that concern is a relic of the 18th century. For over 200 years after the adoption of the Second Amendment, it was uniformly understood as not placing any limit on either federal or state authority to enact gun control legislation.”","-- “[R]arely do we see such an unhelpful, untimely and fanciful idea as the one put forward by [Stevens],” Aaron Blake writes. “The move might as well be considered an in-kind contribution to the National Rifle Association, to Republicans' efforts to keep the House and Senate in 2018, and to President Trump's 2020 reelection bid. In one fell swoop, Stevens has lent credence to the talking point that the left really just wants to get rid of gun ownership and reasserted the need for gun-rights supporters to prevent his ilk from ever being appointed again (with the most obvious answer being: Vote Republican).”","-- Polling shows only 1 in 5 Americans would support such an appeal, Christopher Ingraham notes. “In February, for instance, the Economist and YouGov asked Americans whether they supported a repeal of the Second Amendment. Twenty-one percent said they favored such a proposal, compared with 60 percent in opposition. The poll does, however, show surprisingly robust support for Second Amendment repeal (39 percent) among Democrats (by contrast, 8 percent of Republicans would support a full repeal).”","-- The far-right Internet has circulated memes comparing the Parkland, Fla., survivors to Nazis. From Eli Rosenberg: “Alex Jones, the conservative host of Infowars known for spreading baseless conspiracy theories, depicted two of the most prominent students, Emma González and David Hogg, in a jarring video that spliced images and videos of them into what appeared to be Nazi footage. … Jones’s staff also played a Hitler speech over video of Hogg speaking at the march. Jones said the images were meant to communicate the ‘truly frightening historical iconography that you cannot deny in these parallels of this youth march.’”","-- Margaret Sullivan writes the growing acceptance of such conspiracy theories on the more traditional right underscores the “spreading stain” of extreme partisanship: “What we’re seeing here is a spreading stain, in which conspiracy mongering from the likes of Infowars and, yes, Gateway Pundit is adopted by some elements of the formerly mainstream right and peddled to a receptive audience softened up for decades by Fox News. … There seems to be no floor of indecency that we agree to stay above. As Charlie Warzel, who covers ‘information wars’ for BuzzFeed News, put it recently: Extreme partisanship — pro-Trump media as well as parts of the far left — ‘is not about intellectual courage. It’s about winning.’”","THE MIDTERMS:","-- Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.), who had already ruled out running for Congress again, announced he would remove his name from the GOP primary ballot. Dave Weigel explains: “Had Costello remained on the ballot, he would have faced Greg McCauley, a tax attorney and first-time candidate who began running for a different district in February and jumped into the 6th after the new maps were drawn.”","-- The Cook Political Report views McCauley as too conservative for the district and gives the edge to Democrats to pick up the seat. Amber Phillips notes: “Democrats have two near-certain pickups in Pennsylvania. (The first being Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a special election this month in a district that Trump won by 20 points; Lamb is likely to win in the district in November because of the redrawn lines.) … Put another way: We're entering an election cycle in which every pickup for Democrats matters, and Republican retirements are set to be a major factor in their ability to knock off Republicans.”","-- Mitt Romney pointed to his stance on “dreamers” as an example of how he is more conservative than Trump on certain issues. The Daily Herald’s Katie England reports: “Romney went so far as to say he’s more conservative on certain issues than President Trump. ‘For instance, I’m a deficit hawk ... That makes me more conservative than a lot of Republicans and a lot of Democrats. I’m also more of a hawk on immigration than even the president. My view was these DACA kids shouldn’t all be allowed to stay in the country legally.’”","-- Congressional Republicans are angling for another round of tax cut votes with an eye on the midterms. Politico’s Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade report: “GOP leaders are weighing a series of votes to make last year’s temporary tax cuts for individuals permanent, according to Republicans in both chambers. The strategy would portray the party as the guardian of Americans’ paychecks, Republicans say, and buoy the GOP during a brutal election year. Republicans argue they win regardless of whether it culminates with a Rose Garden ceremony: Either Democrats support the legislation, giving the GOP a major legislative accomplishment in its scramble to save its majorities. Or, more likely, Democrats block the bill — allowing Republicans to paint them as opponents of the middle class.”","-- Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) were in regular contact for days before the “spontaneous” announcement that Florida had been exempted from the administration’s offshore drilling expansion. Politico’s Matt Dixon reports: “[Obtained] documents … contradict the supposed spontaneous event that portrayed Scott as single-handedly securing a politically popular win for Florida’s environmental future only days after the administration had spelled out a controversial new national five-year plan to boost offshore oil drilling. … The records reaffirm the perception at the time that the Trump administration’s decision to reverse course and remove Florida from the list was carefully choreographed to give Scott a political win in his widely expected challenge this year to unseat [Sen.

All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

Facebook declined immediate comment.","In a tweet, Stamos did not deny he was leaving but said: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change.”","The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election","London-based Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denied the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party application in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.","However, further allegations about the firm’s tactics were reported late Monday by British broadcaster Channel 4 which said it secretly taped interviews with senior Cambridge Analytica executives in which they boasted of their ability to sway elections in countries around the world with digital manipulation and traditional political trickery.","Cambridge Analytica rejected the allegations, saying in a statement that the Channel 4 report “is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”","Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from the U.S. Congress after the reports in the New York Times and London’s Observer over the weekend.","Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Widen sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties.","Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.","Facebook and other social media companies including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled.","Late on Monday, the Connecticut Attorney General said the office will initiate an inquiry into Facebook data policies.","The Senate was expected to move forward on Monday with a bill that would chip away at the internet industry’s legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking.","The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

And Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon sat on its board, even naming the company, according The New York Times.","According to the newspaper, \"the firm was effectively a shell\" based in the U.K. and run by foreigners whose contracts with American campaigns — including that of presidential hopeful Ted Cruz — possibly violated Federal Election Commission rules. (The Times interviewed Wylie, who has since left the company and runs another firm.)","The Trump campaign says it briefly used Cambridge Analytica for TV ads and paid some of its data employees, according to The Associated Press.","But congressional investigators have questioned CEO Alexander Nix about the company's role in the campaign.","Nix said last fall that the firm reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the runup to the election to request emails connected to the Hillary Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks said no. It was around the same time that Cambridge began working for the Trump campaign, reports The Wall Street Journal.","The Journal also reports that the firm has become ensnared in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.","And yet as the firm sought to build \"psychographic profiles\" to help discern whom Internet users are and how political messaging might be tailored to them, it turned to Kogan, the Cambridge University psychology professor. The Times says Kogan created the app using a technique developed at the school's Psychometrics Centre, which is designed to map personality traits based Facebook likes. Kogan then put the app on Facebook under the false pretense of using it for academic purposes.","All told, the Times says Kogan handed over more than 50 million profiles to Cambridge Analytica, including information from app users' friends — who had never consented to forgoing their data. Around 30 million of those profiles contained enough information to build psychographic profiles, the newspaper says.","The firm said in its statement, \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Facebook says it will take legal action if it finds something unlawful occurred."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

They were worried about Amazon.","The article, published in 2005 by the Associated Press, addressed concerns that Amazon was amassing too much data about what its customers bought, thought about buying or wished others would buy for them -- not to mention credit card information.","For nearly as long as the current crop of internet giants have existed, there has been scrutiny over how much data they collect and how it's used. And yet we've only continued to hand over more and more of our personal information to these businesses as they've become more embedded in our daily lives.","Call it the grand bargain. You let a tech company eavesdrop on your searches, contacts and whereabouts. In return, the company directs you to the perfect people, products and experiences, free of charge. Or, as Amazon CTO Werner Vogels put it in the 2005 article: \"We collect as much information as possible such that we can provide you with the best feedback.\"","Now, the calculus may be changing. News broke this month that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to President Donald Trump's campaign, reportedly accessed information from about 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.","The resulting scandal has sparked a long awaited data awakening among internet users.","\"People are digging in and looking at the data that's been collected on them,\" says Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT. \"In the past, a lot of us have been willing to say we understand we are in this constant dance with commercial providers.\"","What's changed is people waking up to the fact that their data isn't just used to sell products, but also potentially to affect elections. \"It just feels different,\" Zuckerman said.","Numerous outlets have published articles in recent days detailing the vast amount of data Facebook has collected on its users. In response to a CNN article on the subject, dozens of readers wrote to the author with questions about what Facebook knows and whether the information is ever really deleted.","It's not just Facebook. This week, hundreds of thousands of people engaged with a Twitter thread from a web developer sharing the trove of information that Google collects, including web search history, location data and hobbies.","Even some experts were taken aback by what they found.","\"I had turned off YouTube history under my Google account settings. Today, I find out YouTube has been keeping my history for years anyway,\" Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist who studies the intersection of emerging technology and society, wrote on Twitter. \"I track this stuff for a living. HOW THE HECK IS AN ORDINARY PERSON SUPPOSED TO MANAGE THIS?\"","Inside the tech industry, employees have long been conscious of the potential damaging impact that a data breach could have on user trust.","\"We were always paranoid about that,\" says Wesley Chan, an early product manager at Google who left the company in 2014. \"They're trusting us with their information.\"","But there is also an awareness in Silicon Valley that today's internet users face a \"Hotel California\" dilemma. They can sign out anytime they like, but they can never leave.","\"The problem is with Facebook and Google and even Apple, you're already bought into the service. What alternative do you have?\" Chan says. \"You're switching from Apple to Android or Android to Apple, but you're unfortunately locked onto one of those systems, or both.\"","Case in point: Each of these companies have faced privacy issues before, only to keep adding users and their data.","Years ago, the FTC found Facebook allowed third-party applications to access more user data than they needed to operate. Apple was criticized in 2011 for how it stored user location data. And Google was fined in 2013 for scooping up data from unknowing users while gathering mapping images for its Streetview product.","Critics say that the feeling of being locked in to these services is very much by design.","\"Google, Facebook and other companies put a lot of resources into making that the case,\" says Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for user privacy.","But Gebhart says it's not too late to change our data relationship with the big tech companies, whether it be through new company practices, more educated user choices, or regulation.","\"The surveillance-based business model that runs in most of the popular web is something that's not inevitable,\" she said. \"Right now, there is a broader opportunity to rethink and reset that.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

{"originalurl":"http://mprcenter.org/blog/2013/01/how-obama-won-the-social-media-battle-in-the-2012-presidential-campaign/","title":"How Obama Won the Social Media Battle in the 2012 Presidential Campaign","text":["How Obama Won the Social Media Battle in the 2012 Presidential Campaign","The 2008 Obama Presidential campaign made history. Not only was Obama the first African American to be elected president, but he was also the first presidential candidate to effectively use social media as a major campaign strategy. It’s easy to forget, given how ubiquitous social media is today, that in 2008 sending out voting reminders on Twitter and interacting with people on Facebook was a big deal. When Obama announced his candidacy in 2007, Twitter had only just started and there wasn’t even an iPhone yet.","An effective social media campaign is based on the psychology of social behaviors not the current technology","Four years later, the media landscape looks a lot different. There are an ever-increasing number of social media tools and a rapidly growing user base across all demographics. Current measures of American adults who use social networks are at 69%; that’s up significantly from the 37% of those who had social network profiles in 2008. And contrary to concerns about social media causing civic disengagement, numbers out of Pew Research show that 66% of social media users actively engage in political activism online. They estimate that to be the equivalent of 39% of all American adults. Like many other behaviors, online activities translate into offline ones. Researchers at the MacArthur Research Network on Youth & Participatory Politics report that young people who are politically active online are twice as likely to vote than those who are not.","In the run-up to the 2012 presidential election, there was lots of speculation about the potential impact of social media this time around. In 2008, McCain’s campaign was as social-media-deaf as Obama’s was social-media-savvy. Would the Romney campaign be able to compete in the social cyberspace? Would the Obama campaign be able to effectively harness social technologies again?","Like JFK was the first president who really understood television, Obama is the first social media president. In 2012, Obama not only had the expertise on his team, he had an established social media machine up and running. Since social media is about relationships, having a running start building those connections is a distinct benefit. While the Romney campaign was not left in the dust as McCain’s had been, they did not achieve the traction that the Democrats did.","Obama dominated the social media space because his team got how networks work. The real power of social media is not in the number of posts or Tweets but in user engagement measured by content spreadability. For example, Obama logged twice as many Facebook “Likes” and nearly 20 times as many re-tweets as Romney. With his existing social media base and spreadable content, Obama had far superior reach.","The real drivers of an effective social media campaign, however, are based on the psychology of social behaviors not the current technology.","Participatory Democracy","Social media creates a new political dialogue. It takes the power of political messaging away from the mass media model and places it firmly into peer-to-peer, public discourse. In the 1950s, sociologists Lazersfeld and Katz proposed a two-step model of communication. Their model proposed that opinions area not formed through direct information from mass media but through individual interactions with opinion leaders who were similar in demographics, interests, and socio-economic factors to those they influenced. In other words, opinion leaders are the people you connect with on your social networks, such as family, friends, colleagues and shared-interest group members. As any marketer will tell you, word of mouth advertising—a recommendation from someone you trust–is the most powerful form of persuasion. Social media creates multiple levels of trust based on relationships. Social media also allows information and opinions to travel across networks, like ripples in a pond, amplifying ideas and allowing each person to participate as an opinion leader through media production and distribution, not just by passive consumption. In the 2012 election, 30% of online users report that they were urged to vote via social media by family, friends or other social network connections, 20% actively encouraged others and 22% posted their decision when the voted.","There are lots of social dynamics that influence people’s opinions and behaviors. From social validation to familiarity that turns into acceptance, social networks and the ability to link peer to peer, supercharge the type of self-organizing movement that Obama’s campaign seeded through strategic social media use.","Individual Agency","The increasing use of social media demonstrates to people the power they have as individuals to make a difference increasing both individual and collective agency. Obama’s group tapped into this increasing sense of political empowerment to generate support in spreading the word, encouraging other voters and raising funds. Social media and text messaging create opportunities for individual involvement that feel personal. Personal encourages participation; participation creates ownership. By encouraging contribution through small donations using the social media and cellphones rather than focusing on the traditional big donor strategy, Obama’s campaign succeeded in raising nearly $1billion not to mention the breadth of social capital.","A Campaign of Memes","The immediacy of social media creates instant channels for memes—an idea or symbol—to take hold and spread rapidly. Memes become a dominant cultural event; they frame or even override other messaging. Romney’s campaign was hurt by their lack of understanding of both this phenomenon and the fluidity of Internet media channels. The most notable meme faux pas was the ‘binders full of women’ remark that started on Twitter and immediately went viral across multiple media including parody accounts on Tumblr, Twitter and Facebook.","The Use of Big Data","A final aspect of the Obama campaign’s social media success comes from the increasing sophistication of online data collection. We may equate data harvesting with large online presences such as Google or Amazon, but they aren’t the only ones mining user data. The ability to collect and analyze data on a large scale allowed the Obama team to model behaviors and coordinate and target communications based. They could, for example, predict which types of people could be persuaded by which forms of contact and content. The Obama field offices ranked call lists in order of persuadability allowing them to predict donor behaviors and to mobilize volunteers to get people out to vote, particularly in the critical swing states.","Smart Social Media Strategy Matters","As the 2012 elections show, social media is no longer the “exciting new frontier” for political campaigning. Social media is a normal and central form of communications with distinctly different properties than traditional mass media approaches.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Wylie's revelations detail CA's use of a personality test app to scrape information about not only the Facebook profiles of the app's users, but also their friends. The app harvested personal details of over 50 million users, which were analysed to create targeted political advertising profiles for clients including the Trump campaign in the 2016 US presidential election.

The number of users’ data the firm reportedly gained access to (50 million) is much higher because it includes the users’ friends. The number of user data, it follows, was much higher for the Obama campaign, too.","The Obama campaign created a Facebook app for supporters to donate, learn of voting requirements, and find nearby houses to canvass. The app asked users’ permission to scan their photos, friends lists, and news feeds. Most users complied.","The people signing up knew the data they were handing over would be used to support a political campaign. Their friends, however, did not.","The people who downloaded the app used by Cambridge Analytica did not know their data would be used to aid any political campaigns. The app was billed as a personality quiz that would be used by Cambridge University researchers.","Aleksandr Kogan, one of the Cambridge researchers involved in the project, sold the data to the upstart political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The company then sold its services not only to the Trump campaign, but to the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz and the senatorial campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., among others.","When Facebook discovered a developer had shared users’ data without their consent in 2015, it asked both the original app and the consultancy to delete the data. That didn’t happen.","\"The thing that is true is that every Facebook app you downloaded back then was getting access to your entire friends list,\" said David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. \"When tech people were trying to raise outrage about it they were being ignored. Now, everyone is outraged. But what (McCain) is wrong about this is that Kogan then sold it, and for a much creepier purpose.\"","How it was used","Obama operatives used Facebook data to get users to send their messaging for them, according to Eitan Hersh, a Tufts professor who wrote Hacking the Electorate, a book on Obama’s microtargeting strategies.","Facebook friends lists, tags and photos allowed Obama operatives to identify a person’s close friends, which they then matched with offline public records. (Was this person likely to vote for Obama, but unlikely to get out to vote?) They then told the app users which of their friends they should send campaign messages to.","Cambridge Analytica dialed up what Karpf called the creepiness factor. They combined the survey results with the Facebook data to create psychological profiles they then sold to campaigns. The idea was, if the firm could discover how these people thought, they could target ads toward them.","They then sent targeted ads to the users on the database. The friends of the app users weren’t being targeted by their friends, but by the campaign itself. In other words, the consenting middle man was gone.","In his research, Hersh found that neither tactic was greatly effective at persuading people to vote.","Our ruling","McCain said that there was a strong equivalence between how the Obama and Trump campaigns accessed user data on Facebook.","The Obama campaign and Cambridge Analytica both gained access to huge amounts of information about Facebook users and their friends, and in neither case did the friends of app users consent.","But in Obama’s case, direct users knew they were handing over their data to a political campaign. In the Cambridge Analytica case, users only knew were taking a personality quiz for academic purposes.","The Obama campaign used the data to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends. Cambridge Analytica targeted users and their friends directly with digital ads."],"isopubdate":""}

This weekend, Facebook banned the high-profile data firm Cambridge Analytica — paid more than $6 million by President Trump’s 2016 campaign — after a joint New York Times/Guardian probe revealed the improper harvesting of data from an estimated 50 million users of the platform.","PAUL SAKUMA/ASSOCIATED PRESS","“It’s like Nixon on steroids.”","Nixon on steroids, indeed. In 1972, the 37th president's dirty tricksters got caught in the Watergate with some Radio Shack-style gizmos and some badly applied duct tape trying to bug the Democratic Party's headquarters so they could try to steal the words of one man, party chief Larry O'Brien. That act — and the various cover-ups and sleazy maneuvers that surrounded it — cost Richard Nixon his presidency.","You might have heard this weekend that Facebook — from whom the data was obtained and where much of the ensuing psychological warfare took place in the summer and fall of 2016 — has now banned the firm, Cambridge Analytica. It was not a bold move by Mark Zuckerberg's social media behemoth but a cowardly one, taken just minutes before some stellar reporting by the Guardian's Carole Cadwalladr and journalists from the New York Times jointly exposed the hijacking of the data and, arguably, the theft of an American presidential election. Facebook's too-little-too-late action was the ultimate closing of the barn door after the horse has already bolted — the horse being American democracy.","What CA lacked, however, was the data the pull this off. That's when what Facebook's top lawyer has now acknowledged was \"a scam — and a fraud\" came into play. Wylie — the young political data maven now turned whistleblower — and the team assembled by Mercer and Bannon turned to experts in \"psychometrics\" at Britain's Cambridge University; there, a Russian American (heh … a bit more on that later) professor named Aleksandr Kogan was hired for $800,000. Kogan reportedly then lied to Facebook about his real project — a personality quiz and an app that 270,000 people consented to but which allowed the firm to pull Facebook \"likes\" and other personal info from 50 million unsuspecting Americans. (The company also seems to have lied to Facebook about later destroying the data.)","Indeed, Wylie noted that Cambridge Analytica emerged from a defense contractor called SCL and what it began to market in the mid-2000s was \"cyber warfare for elections.\" The Mercer-and-Bannon-backed CA was initially hired to work for GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016 — Mercer's initial horse in the race — but the team had switched by summer 2016 to party nominee Trump, which then paid the firm about $6 million.","What does political cyber warfare look like? As you might imagine, pretty ugly. In an election where most voters' preferences are deeply rooted, a campaign like the one engineered by Cambridge Analytica tried to tap into the psychology of the voters who could most easily be peeled away from Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton — young people who might be convinced to vote third-party, or blacks who'd been enthusiastic about Barack Obama but could be discouraged from showing up in 2016. Data seemingly as trivial as what sneakers or candy bars you like helped develop profiles of the persuadable.","There are three big takeaways here. The first one goes well beyond Trump's election as president. Folks have been warning about this for years, but clearly we have created something of a monster in the rise of social media. Make no mistake: There are many positives you can attribute to sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram: reconnecting with friends from yesteryear, getting information about news or sports in real time, or launching powerful social movements. But at the end of the day, a capitalist company such as Facebook and its billionaire founder Zuckerberg have gotten rich by exploiting the essence of our humanity — our friendships and even our personalities — for profit. The Trump-Cambridge Analytica scandal is a two-lane highway to hell — your intimate personal data flowing north to shady operators, then flowing back south as divisive negative politics or even \"fake news.\" That's an existential threat not just to democracy but to a broader civil society."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

City Pages first reported Franson’s comments. Her Facebook page was back online Wednesday.","First, she shared another person’s Facebook post referring to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student David Hogg, who is advocating for gun reforms, as “Supreme Leader Hogg.”","Soon after that, she reposted a comment from Ryan Saavedra with the conservative opinion website The Daily Wire. Saavedra had said, “Parkland student says at the #MarchForOurLives rally: ‘When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile!’ This is why you do NOT give anything to left on anything.”","“And there you have it friends ... the anti gunners, the high school students who speak for all, aren’t interested in an ‘inch’. They want the mile. They want your guns. Gone,” Franson wrote above Saavedra’s comments.","Fifteen minutes later, she shared a web page labeled “Indoctrinating Youth” from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and posted an Adolf Hitler quote with it.

I’ve deleted the post to clear up any confusion,” Franson said in an e-mail Tuesday.","But Douglas County DFL Chairman Jon Koll said he was not surprised to see the series of posts, and he noted a situation last year when Franson declined requests to meet with the Alexandria Area High School Democratic Club. After pressure mounted she met with the students, but was “blatantly rude” and “condescending,” he said.","Previous comments in public or on social media have also landed Franson in the news during her four terms in the Legislature.

{"originalurl":"https://www.slashgear.com/facebook-personal-audit-privacy-app-sharing-19523634/","title":"You need to do this personal Facebook audit - SlashGear","text":["You need to do this personal Facebook audit","Facebook is under fire for how carefully it treats your personal data, but you don’t need to wait for regulators to wade in before doing an audit on how socially exposed you are. The social network doesn’t make it too obvious how you can limit the visibility on things like third-party apps and what Facebook games can see about you, but it’s not impossible. Indeed, it’s worth taking a few minutes to go through and make sure you’re comfortable with just how your Facebook account is set up.","Certainly, I can’t blame you if you decide to delete your Facebook account altogether. The social network has always been a huge potential time-sink. Now, with reports of voter manipulation, fake news squeezing out real reports, and little evidence that Facebook has put cleaning things up any higher than its efforts to encourage you to log back in again and again, even more people are left wondering whether they can do without the social network altogether.","All the same, washing your hands of Facebook completely might be too much for many to stomach. After all, it’s become the primary way that a lot of people keep in touch with distant family and friends; despite efforts by others, little has stepped in with a realistic chance of replacing that. That doesn’t mean you can’t do some housekeeping of your own, mind.","A good place to start with that is your Facebook App Settings. If you’ve been using the site for a while, you might be surprised to discover just how many sites and services have been granted access to your Facebook data. Happily the site does have a page which pulls them all together, and if you’re anything like me it can make for surprising reading.","Services I’d not used for literally years were still hanging around in there. Sites I’d tried once and then never used again, but which had been merrily linked to my Facebook account ever since. Remember MOTOBLUR, or the Nokia N900? Those apps still had access.","Facebook makes it straightforward to delete them, and you can also delete any of the activities – including posts, photos, and videos – that they may have added to your account over the years. It’s good practice to do this across any social network that offers third-party integration, frankly: I do it periodically with Twitter, but hadn’t thought to dig into my Facebook account, which I use primarily for work purposes.","You can go further than that, however. If the Cambridge Analytica controversy has you spooked about Facebook, but you don’t want to drop the social network altogether, there are two other options.","First is “Turn Platform Off.” Basically, that shuts down all Facebook integrations on third-party apps and websites. Turn it off, and you can’t log into them using your Facebook credentials, any posts by third-party apps will be deleted from your profile, and any apps you’ve logged into are removed. Facebook friends using third-party apps and services won’t be able to interact with you through them, even though you’re still friends on the site.","The other change worth considering is “Apps others use”: it’s this which turned less than 300k people playing one Facebook research game into about a data cache of 50m users and started the whole Cambridge Analytica saga. In short, it’s what permissions Facebook has to share your details when your friend uses another app. Even if you’re not playing games on Facebook, or taking tests, if your friends are, the creators of those games and tests could get access to your information.","When I checked, most of the data was set to share by default. That meant companies I never interacted with could see my birthday, family and relationships, my online status, and indeed my own app activity. It’s worth noting, though, that even if you uncheck every box, apps and websites will still be able to see your friend list, gender, and information you’ve made public.","Certainly, there’s nothing quite so secure when it comes to preserving the “personal” in personal information as deleting your Facebook account altogether. Nonetheless if you’re not quite at that stage yet – and I can’t entirely blame you for that – there are still some steps worth taking in making sure your data is as protected as possible."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.”","Facebook shares fell as much as 6.5 percent, briefly dipping below $150 for the first time since July 2017, before recovering the day's losses to close up 0.4 percent at $160.06.","The shares are still down 13 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channelled to Cambridge Analytica. The company has lost more than $70 billion (£49.1 billion) in market value since then.","The recovery in Facebook's stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company's relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.","The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.","If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.","Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company's privacy practices.","The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.","The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.","“Facebook's failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,\" said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.","In Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is \"absolutely certain\" that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.","Zuckerberg apologised last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.","\"The was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,\" Zuckerberg said in the ads. \"We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"","'FUTURE REGULATION'","His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany's justice minister said Facebook's promises were not enough.","\"In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,\" Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.","Advertisers and users are also unhappy.","U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet's YouTube for one week.","Internet company Mozilla Corp, Germany's second-largest bank Commerzbank AG and British advertising group ISBA all suspended advertising on Facebook last week.","Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.","Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.","(Reporting by David Shepardson; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Susan Thomas)"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie.

Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

Because I know that they could have prevented it.’\nPhotograph: Robert Gumpert","Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.","Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.","Where's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds","Read more","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.","Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Revelations over the weekend about its reckless sharing of user data sent its stock price plunging on Monday, and fresh calls for regulations on the social media network are looking more real than ever.","In the last few days, multipleoutlets broke various facets of the story: Facebook has known since 2015 that Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining company hired by President Trump’s election campaign, improperly obtained the personal data of 50 million of the network’s users—and the social giant failed to do much of anything about it.

And whatever you do, Facebook execs say, don’t call this a “breach.”","So after years of Facebook big shots telling us to just trust them when it comes to the ways it handles our data and targets us with advertising, a third-party allegedly violated Facebook’s trust.

According to Reuters:","One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised ‘systemic problems’ with Facebook’s business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform...","‘We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,’ said Brian Wieser, analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group, which already has a ‘sell’ rating on a stock that rose 60 percent last year.","Wieser argued that regulatory risks for the company would intensify and enhanced use of data in advertising would be at greater risk than before.","He added, however, that it was unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the company’s business for now, with advertisers unlikely to ‘suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform.’","Advertisement","It’s true that Facebook has previously weathered similar storms by either outright denying any issues exist or promising to just keep tweaking that algorithm and rolling out new terms of service. But this time feels a bit different.","Lawmakers around the world have vocally called for regulations, hearings, and investigations into this incident over the last few days and more continue to chime in. New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone insisted on Monday that “the Energy and Commerce Committee must hold hearings soon.” That follows Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobucher’s demand that Mark Zuckerberg appear to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden grilling him with questions.","On top of that, experts say that this case could easily be determined as a violation of the FTC’s consent decree that resolved a previous privacy case in 2011. If FTC investigators decided to throw the book at Facebook, they could potentially levy “trillions of dollars” worth of fines against the company.","Advertisement","British Prime Minister Theresa May released a statement on Monday expressing her concerns about the story, and British Parliament member Damian Collins went further, saying, “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”","In the past, Zuckerberg has typically addressed controversies with long essays on his personal Facebook page and promises to do better. But so far, the CEO has been quiet about this particular controversy. We’ve reached out to Facebook to ask if it has a timeframe for when Zuckerberg plans to address this incident personally and we’ll update this post when we receive a reply.","Facebook’s growth and revenue have consistently gone up over the years, but in late January the company reported that people were spending less time on the platform and it experienced its first-ever decline in daily users. As awareness grows about this incident, public wariness of Facebook is certain to increase. After all, how many other “non-breaches” have occurred just like this one?","Advertisement","But it’s lawmakers, above all, that Facebook and its investors need to fear. Protracted investigations and hearings could have a chilling effect on the company’s stock as uncertainty grows. It will likely be alone in any fights against Washington as the tech industry looks for a sacrificial lamb to offer up in penance for its sins. And politicians around the globe are dealing with populist uprisings fueled by outside actors agitating through Facebook—in other words, they have an ax to grind.","All of the mega-corporations of tech have misdeeds to account for, but Facebook is relatively unique in the ways that its platform has been used, and the extremely personal information it collects.","Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytics employee who blew the whistle on this case, claimed in an interview with The Guardian that he “made Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool.” While Wylie may have made the tool, it seems more and more clear that Mark Zuckerberg provided the steel, the forge, and the target."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

(Image: Sinclair Broadcast Group)","WASHINGTON (SBG) —","A number of Facebook users are changing their status with the social media giant from \"It's Complicated\" to \"Separated\" after learning the company mishandled user data and shared it with third-party developers.","For any public company, trust is its currency. The latest revelations of a massive user privacy breach at Facebook have raised new questions about whether the company can and should be trusted to responsibly manage the personal data of its more than 2.1 billion users.","#DeleteFacebook began trending last week after reports that Facebook allowed the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly access the personal data of as many as 50 million users. According to admissions by Cambridge Analytica, the data was used to develop psychographic profiles to help political campaigns target voters.","In the aftermath of these revelations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone on a charm offensive, speaking with reporters, apologizing for mishandling user data and promising to do better in the future.","On Sunday, Zuckerberg took out a full-page ad in multiple U.S. newspapers that read, \"We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't we don't deserve it.\"","The ad referred to the Cambridge Analytica operation and the actions of a \"university researcher,\" Aleksandr Kogan, who developed a quiz app in 2014 on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Under Facebook's policy at the time, Kogan was able to pay for a feature called \"friends permission.\" That allowed him to harvest the data of 270,000 quiz-takers, who gave explicit consent to use their data, as well as the data that could be gleaned from their friend networks.","In his ad, Zuckerberg admitted that Kogan's app was not the only one that trawled large amounts of user information. \"We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,\" Zuckerberg said. He concluded, \"Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.\"","Some have taken note of the CEO's apology and applauded the company for taking steps to make its data-sharing policies more transparent. Zuckerberg and other executives at Facebook have published notices explaining steps they're taking to crack down on platform abuses as well as their efforts to make privacy settings more user-friendly.","Others have pointed to the fact that Facebook's business model is based on monetizing user data.","\"Facebook says we don't sell your data, but they certainly provide access to it,\" observed Michelle De Mooy, director of the privacy and data project at the Center for Democracy and Technology.","Moreover, Facebook acknowledged that it knew about Cambridge Analytica's questionable contract with Kogan in 2015. At that time, they suspended Kogan and asked him to confirm that he had deleted the user data. According to reports, that user data remained accessible to Cambridge Analytica for years.","\"Facebook has been dragged, seemingly kicking and screaming into being more transparent,\" said Dave Levine, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University. \"Facebook has not done nearly as much as it could, simply by way of explanation to the public about its behaviors, about how your information or posts are curated, about what kind of data it collects and how it shares it.\"","The Cambridge Analytica breach is only the latest example of the company's opacity and delayed response to public outcry. Facebook has been at the center of the fake news controversy and spreading misinformation during the 2016 election. The company has been called before Congress over their role in facilitating Russian election interference and online terrorist recruitment. And the company finally acknowledged and changed their newsfeed policy after being caught suppressing conservative content.","Each scandal has temporarily hurt Facebook, but the latest scandal over violating users' privacy could be the one that tips the scales and imposes real costs and consequences on the social media giant.","\"Ultimately the problem here is one of trust,\" explained Julian Sanchez, privacy and technology fellow at the Cato Institute. If users no longer believe the company is responsibly handling their information or feel they cannot understand the company's policies for sharing their data, Zuckerberg's apologies will be \"too little, too late,\" Sanchez noted.","\"Once that's burned, once people don't have a sense of trust, I don't know if the specific policy changes will help much,\" he continued. \"Even if they really are making genuine improvements, as it appears they are, once that trust is gone, it's hard to get back.\"","In a new poll conducted in the days after the data sharing scandal erupted, Reuters/Ipsos found that the majority of respondents do not trust Facebook to handle their data.","Facebook was deemed the least trustworthy when it came to obeying laws that protect American's personal information when compared to other companies that gather user data like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo.","\"Maybe the poll is new, but the sentiment is not,\" De Mooy explained. The reason, she said, is that social media platforms \"are designed for opacity,\" intentionally making it harder for users to understand and make informed decisions about their data.","Facebook and other companies that rely on selling access to user data have had to walk a thin line between protecting their users' data and monetizing it. Consistently over recent years, polls have shown that even as users sign up and sign away some of the rights to their data, they are wary of how that information is being used.","Periodically, this concern has translated into relatively short-lived calls for people to deactivate their Facebook accounts, but it is not clear that those efforts have caused the company to fundamentally change how it operates.","\"If a few hundred-thousand people delete their Facebook accounts that will have a marginal impact on their bottom line,\" Levine noted. \"However if there is a reputational hit at the trust level, which is what Facebook needs to maintain in order to be a viable business, that cumulatively could create problems.\"","In recent weeks, Facebook has taken a significant hit with the markets valuing the breach of privacy and trust in the tens of billions. Since the story broke earlier this month, Facebook's stock has plunged more than 15 percent in a selling spree that has cost the company over $75 billion in market value.","Facebook could also be facing even more costs as the consumer protection watchdogs at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Monday that they had opened a non-public investigation into Facebook's privacy and data use policies based on the reports about the company's relationship with Cambridge Analytica.","The FTC already brought charges against Facebook in 2011 for what it termed \"deceptive privacy claims.\" At the time, Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC and signed a consent decree which, among other things, required the company to obtain a user's explicit consent before allowing third parties to access their data. Moreover, the agreement required Facebook to inform users if they discovered they were unable to protect their data.","\"Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here,\" former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection Jessica Rich told the Washington Post last week. \"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties.\"","If the FTC finds Facebook in violation of the consent decree, the company could face a $40,000 fine per violation. It is not clear whether that fine would apply to the alleged 50 million users whose data was shared inappropriately with Cambridge Analytica. In a statement to the Post, a Facebook spokesperson said the company rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\"","De Mooy said she is encouraged by the FTC investigation, emphasizing that \"the consent decrees need to be meaningful.\" However, she worries that regulators simply lack the enforcement authority when it comes to protecting consumer data.","In the United States, consumer data is largely governed by contracts and terms of use agreements between the consumer and the company. This approach is vastly different from the European Union, which will be implementing a new regime of privacy protections, the General Data Protection Regulation, beginning in May.","The new privacy regime will directly impact U.S. tech companies that will be required to be more transparent in informing consumers about their sharing practices in order to get consent. Companies that fail to protect user data can also expect to see millions of dollars in fines.","It is yet to be seen whether U.S. lawmakers, who have traditionally taken a lax approach to regulating internet companies, will take steps to strengthen data privacy protections."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

It's bought and sold every day.","When advertisers want to target a specific group of customers who, for example, are a particular age and have a certain political affiliation or interest, Facebook makes that possible. The stuff you share and the inferences Facebook makes about you are packaged together with similar people's data, stripped of names and sold to companies. That allows businesses to put ads in front of people they're certain they can influence.","On Facebook, you are the product. Advertisers are the customer.","Facebook's not alone. Most advertiser-supported networks sell some of your information to third parties. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL, Amazon, Twitter and Yelp do the same.","Related: What You need to know about Facebook's data debacle","Giving up our privacy is the price we pay for getting to use Facebook for free. Most of the time, that tradeoff works: People take advantage of free services by posting, searching and sharing. Most companies that collect our data use it for legitimate purposes and within the bounds that companies like Facebook permit.","That arrangement has turned Facebook and Google into online advertising juggernauts. They have built massive audiences of billions of customers, and advertisers flock to them. Facebook and Google control three-quarters of the $83 billion digital advertising market in the United States, according to eMarketer.","But the customer-is-the-product deal doesn't always work to the user's advantage. This weekend, the public learned data company Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed 50 million Facebook users' personal information to influence the 2016 election.","Internet companies have a financial disincentive to give users more control over their data. If people share less, social networks will earn less money.","Most companies offer privacy settings, and some even let you leave and take your data with you. But they don't make it easy, and critics say social networks and internet companies should give users far more say about which data ends up in advertisers' hands -- and when.","\"Tech companies can and should do more to protect users, including giving users far more control over what data is collected and how that data is used,\" said the Electronic Freedom Foundation in a statement. \"That starts with meaningful transparency.\"","Once you share something on any digital service, your personal information leaves your control.

It was a very strange speech. Was it one branch of the intelligence services sending a shot across the bows of another? Or was it pointed at Theresa May’s government? Does she know something she’s not telling us?”Senior intelligence analyst, April 2017","In January 2013, a young American postgraduate was passing through London when she was called up by the boss of a firm where she’d previously interned. The company, SCL Elections, went on to be bought by Robert Mercer, a secretive hedge fund billionaire, renamed Cambridge Analytica, and achieved a certain notoriety as the data analytics firm that played a role in both Trump and Brexit campaigns. But all of this was still to come. London in 2013 was still basking in the afterglow of the Olympics. Britain had not yet Brexited. The world had not yet turned.","Follow the data: does a legal document link Brexit campaigns to US billionaire?","Read more","“That was before we became this dark, dystopian data company that gave the world Trump,” a former Cambridge Analytica employee who I’ll call Paul tells me. “It was back when we were still just a psychological warfare firm.”","Was that really what you called it, I ask him. Psychological warfare? “Totally. That’s what it is. Psyops. Psychological operations – the same methods the military use to effect mass sentiment change. It’s what they mean by winning ‘hearts and minds’. We were just doing it to win elections in the kind of developing countries that don’t have many rules.”","Why would anyone want to intern with a psychological warfare firm, I ask him. And he looks at me like I am mad. “It was like working for MI6. Only it’s MI6 for hire. It was very posh, very English, run by an old Etonian and you got to do some really cool things. Fly all over the world. You were working with the president of Kenya or Ghana or wherever. It’s not like election campaigns in the west. You got to do all sorts of crazy shit.”","On that day in January 2013, the intern met up with SCL’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, and gave him the germ of an idea. “She said, ‘You really need to get into data.’ She really drummed it home to Alexander. And she mentioned to him a firm that belonged to someone she knew about through her father.”","I had been speaking to former employees of Cambridge Analytica for months and heard dozens of hair-raising stories, but it was still a gobsmacking moment. To anyone concerned about surveillance, Palantir is practically now a trigger word. The data-mining firm has contracts with governments all over the world – including GCHQ and the NSA. It’s owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal and major investor in Facebook, who became Silicon Valley’s first vocal supporter of Trump.","In some ways, an intern showing up and referring to Palantir is just another weird detail in the weirdest story I have ever researched.","A weird but telling detail. Because it goes to the heart of why the story of Cambridge Analytica is one of the most profoundly unsettling of our time. What’s clear is that the power and dominance of the Silicon Valley – Google and Facebook and a small handful of others – are at the centre of the global tectonic shift we are currently witnessing.","It also reveals a critical and gaping hole in the political debate in Britain. Because what is happening in America and what is happening in Britain are entwined. Brexit and Trump are entwined. The Trump administration’s links to Russia and Britain are entwined. And Cambridge Analytica is one point of focus through which we can see all these relationships in play; it also reveals the elephant in the room as we hurtle into a general election: Britain tying its future to an America that is being remade - in a radical and alarming way - by Trump.","There are three strands to this story. How the foundations of an authoritarian surveillance state are being laid in the US. How British democracy was subverted through a covert, far-reaching plan of coordination enabled by a US billionaire. And how we are in the midst of a massive land grab for power by billionaires via our data. Data which is being silently amassed, harvested and stored. Whoever owns this data owns the future.","My entry point into this story began, as so many things do, with a late-night Google. Last December, I took an unsettling tumble into a wormhole of Google autocomplete suggestions that ended with “did the holocaust happen”. And an entire page of results that claimed it didn’t.","Google’s algorithm had been gamed by extremist sites and it was Jonathan Albright, a professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, who helped me get to grips with what I was seeing. He was the first person to map and uncover an entire “alt-right” news and information ecosystem and he was the one who first introduced me to Cambridge Analytica.","He called the company a central point in the right’s “propaganda machine”, a line I quoted in reference to its work for the Trump election campaign and the referendum Leave campaign. That led to the second article featuring Cambridge Analytica – as a central node in the alternative news and information network that I believed Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon, the key Trump aide who is now his chief strategist, were creating. I found evidence suggesting they were on a strategic mission to smash the mainstream media and replace it with one comprising alternative facts, fake history and rightwing propaganda.","Mercer is a brilliant computer scientist, a pioneer in early artificial intelligence, and the co-owner of one of the most successful hedge funds on the planet (with a gravity-defying 71.8% annual return). And, he is also, I discovered, good friends with Nigel Farage. Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s communications director, told me that it was Mercer who had directed his company, Cambridge Analytica, to “help” the Leave campaign.","The second article triggered two investigations, which are both continuing: one by the Information Commissioner’s Office into the possible illegal use of data. And a second by the Electoral Commission which is “focused on whether one or more donations – including services – accepted by Leave.EU was ‘impermissable’”.","What I then discovered is that Mercer’s role in the referendum went far beyond this. Far beyond the jurisdiction of any UK law. The key to understanding how a motivated and determined billionaire could bypass ourelectoral laws rests on AggregateIQ, an obscure web analytics company based in an office above a shop in Victoria, British Columbia.","It was with AggregateIQ that Vote Leave (the official Leave campaign) chose to spend £3.9m, more than half its official £7m campaign budget. As did three other affiliated Leave campaigns: BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist party, spending a further £757,750. “Coordination” between campaigns is prohibited under UK electoral law, unless campaign expenditure is declared, jointly. It wasn’t. Vote Leave says the Electoral Commission “looked into this” and gave it “a clean bill of health”.","How did an obscure Canadian company come to play such a pivotal role in Brexit? It’s a question that Martin Moore, director of the centre for the study of communication, media and power at King’s College London has been asking too. “I went through all the Leave campaign invoices when the Electoral Commission uploaded them to its site in February. And I kept on discovering all these huge amounts going to a company that not only had I never heard of, but that there was practically nothing at all about on the internet. More money was spent with AggregateIQ than with any other company in any other campaign in the entire referendum. All I found, at that time, was a one-page website and that was it. It was an absolute mystery.”","Moore contributed to an LSE report published in April that concluded UK’s electoral laws were “weak and helpless” in the face of new forms of digital campaigning. Offshore companies, money poured into databases, unfettered third parties… the caps on spending had come off. The laws that had always underpinned Britain’s electoral laws were no longer fit for purpose. Laws, the report said, that needed “urgently reviewing by parliament”.","AggregateIQ holds the key to unravelling another complicated network of influence that Mercer has created. A source emailed me to say he had found that AggregateIQ’s address and telephone number corresponded to a company listed on Cambridge Analytica’s website as its overseas office: “SCL Canada”. A day later, that online reference vanished.","There had to be a connection between the two companies. Between the various Leave campaigns. Between the referendum and Mercer. It was too big a coincidence. But everyone – AggregateIQ, Cambridge Analytica, Leave.EU, Vote Leave – denied it. AggregateIQ had just been a short-term “contractor” to Cambridge Analytica. There was nothing to disprove this. We published the known facts. On 29 March, article 50 was triggered.","Then I meet Paul, the first of two sources formerly employed by Cambridge Analytica. He is in his late 20s and bears mental scars from his time there. “It’s almost like post-traumatic shock. It was so… messed up. It happened so fast. I just woke up one morning and found we’d turned into the Republican fascist party. I still can’t get my head around it.”","He laughed when I told him the frustrating mystery that was AggregateIQ. “Find Chris Wylie,” he said.","Who’s Chris Wylie?","“He’s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica. And he’s from west Canada. It’s only because of him that AggregateIQ exist. They’re his friends. He’s the one who brought them in.”","There wasn’t just a relationship between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, Paul told me. They were intimately entwined, key nodes in Robert Mercer’s distributed empire. “The Canadians were our back office. They built our software for us. They held our database. If AggregateIQ is involved then Cambridge Analytica is involved. And if Cambridge Analytica is involved, then Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon are involved. You need to find Chris Wylie.”","Key to understanding how data would transform the company is knowing where it came from. And it’s a letter from “Director of Defence Operations, SCL Group”, that helped me realise this. It’s from “Commander Steve Tatham, PhD, MPhil, Royal Navy (rtd)” complaining about my use in my Mercer article of the word “disinformation”.","I wrote back to him pointing out references in papers he’d written to “deception” and “propaganda”, which I said I understood to be “roughly synonymous with ‘disinformation’.” It’s only later that it strikes me how strange it is that I’m corresponding with a retired navy commander about military strategies that may have been used in British and US elections.","What’s been lost in the US coverage of this “data analytics” firm is the understanding of where the firm came from: deep within the military-industrial complex. A weird British corner of it populated, as the military establishment in Britain is, by old-school Tories. Geoffrey Pattie, a former parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence procurement and director of Marconi Defence Systems, used to be on the board, and Lord Marland, David Cameron’s pro-Brexit former trade envoy, a shareholder.","Steve Tatham was the head of psychological operations for British forces in Afghanistan. The Observer has seen letters endorsing him from the UK Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and Nato.","SCL/Cambridge Analytica was not some startup created by a couple of guys with a Mac PowerBook. It’s effectively part of the British defence establishment. And, now, too, the American defence establishment. An ex-commanding officer of the US Marine Corps operations centre, Chris Naler, has recently joined Iota Global, a partner of the SCL group.","This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.”","Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,” David tells me.","And it was Facebook that made it possible. It was from Facebook that Cambridge Analytica obtained its vast dataset in the first place. Earlier, psychologists at Cambridge University harvested Facebook data (legally) for research purposes and published pioneering peer-reviewed work about determining personality traits, political partisanship, sexuality and much more from people’s Facebook “likes”. And SCL/Cambridge Analytica contracted a scientist at the university, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, to harvest new Facebook data. And he did so by paying people to take a personality quiz which also allowed not just their own Facebook profiles to be harvested, but also those of their friends – a process then allowed by the social network.","Facebook was the source of the psychological insights that enabled Cambridge Analytica to target individuals. It was also the mechanism that enabled them to be delivered on a large scale.","The company also (perfectly legally) bought consumer datasets – on everything from magazine subscriptions to airline travel – and uniquely it appended these with the psych data to voter files. It matched all this information to people’s addresses, their phone numbers and often their email addresses. “The goal is to capture every single aspect of every voter’s information environment,” said David. “And the personality data enabled Cambridge Analytica to craft individual messages.”","Finding “persuadable” voters is key for any campaign and with its treasure trove of data, Cambridge Analytica could target people high in neuroticism, for example, with images of immigrants “swamping” the country. The key is finding emotional triggers for each individual voter.","Cambridge Analytica worked on campaigns in several key states for a Republican political action committee. Its key objective, according to a memo the Observer has seen, was “voter disengagement” and “to persuade Democrat voters to stay at home”: a profoundly disquieting tactic. It has previously been claimed that suppression tactics were used in the campaign, but this document provides the first actual evidence.","But does it actually work? One of the criticisms that has been levelled at my and others’ articles is that Cambridge Analytica’s “special sauce” has been oversold. Is what it is doing any different from any other political consultancy?","“It’s not a political consultancy,” says David. “You have to understand this is not a normal company in any way. I don’t think Mercer even cares if it ever makes any money. It’s the product of a billionaire spending huge amounts of money to build his own experimental science lab, to test what works, to find tiny slivers of influence that can tip an election. Robert Mercer did not invest in this firm until it ran a bunch of pilots – controlled trials. This is one of the smartest computer scientists in the world. He is not going to splash $15m on bullshit.”","Tamsin Shaw, an associate professor of philosophy at New York University, helps me understand the context. She has researched the US military’s funding and use of psychological research for use in torture. “The capacity for this science to be used to manipulate emotions is very well established. This is military-funded technology that has been harnessed by a global plutocracy and is being used to sway elections in ways that people can’t even see, don’t even realise is happening to them,” she says. “It’s about exploiting existing phenomenon like nationalism and then using it to manipulate people at the margins. To have so much data in the hands of a bunch of international plutocrats to do with it what they will is absolutely chilling.","“We are in an information war and billionaires are buying up these companies, which are then employed to go to work in the heart of government. That’s a very worrying situation.”","Google is not ‘just’ a platform. It frames, shapes and distorts how we see the world","Read more","A project that Cambridge Analytica carried out in Trinidad in 2013 brings all the elements in this story together. Just as Robert Mercer began his negotiations with SCL boss Alexander Nix about an acquisition, SCL was retained by several government ministers in Trinidad and Tobago. The brief involved developing a micro-targeting programme for the governing party of the time. And AggregateIQ – the same company involved in delivering Brexit for Vote Leave – was brought in to build the targeting platform.","David said: “The standard SCL/CA method is that you get a government contract from the ruling party. And this pays for the political work. So, it’s often some bullshit health project that’s just a cover for getting the minister re-elected. But in this case, our government contacts were with Trinidad’s national security council.”","The security work was to be the prize for the political work. Documents seen by the Observer show that this was a proposal to capture citizens’ browsing history en masse, recording phone conversations and applying natural language processing to the recorded voice data to construct a national police database, complete with scores for each citizen on their propensity to commit crime.","“The plan put to the minister was Minority Report. It was pre-crime. And the fact that Cambridge Analytica is now working inside the Pentagon is, I think, absolutely terrifying,” said David.","These documents throw light on a significant and under-reported aspect of the Trump administration. The company that helped Trump achieve power in the first place has now been awarded contracts in the Pentagon and the US state department. Its former vice-president Steve Bannon now sits in the White House. It is also reported to be in discussions for “military and homeland security work”.","In the US, the government is bound by strict laws about what data it can collect on individuals. But, for private companies anything goes. Is it unreasonable to see in this the possible beginnings of an authoritarian surveillance state?","A state that is bringing corporate interests into the heart of the administration. Documents detail Cambridge Analytica is involved with many other right-leaning billionaires, including Rupert Murdoch. One memo references Cambridge Analytica trying to place an article with a journalist in Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal: “RM re-channeled and connected with Jamie McCauley from Robert Thomson News Corp office,” it says.","It makes me think again about the story involving the intern, Cambridge Analytica and Palantir. Is it a telling detail, or is it a clue to something else going on? Cambridge Analytica and Palantir both declined to comment for this article on whether they had any relationship. But witnesses and emails confirm that meetings between Cambridge Analytica and Palantir took place in 2013. The possibility of a working relationship was at least discussed.","Further documents seen by the Observer confirm that at least one senior Palantir employee consulted with Cambridge Analytica in relation to the Trinidad project and later political work in the US. But at the time, I’m told, Palantir decided it was too much of a reputational risk for a more formal arrangement. There was no upside to it. Palantir is a company that is trusted to handle vast datasets on UK and US citizens for GCHQ and the NSA, as well as many other countries.","Now though, they are both owned by ideologically aligned billionaires: Robert Mercer and Peter Thiel. The Trump campaign has said that Thiel helped it with data. A campaign that was led by Steve Bannon, who was then at Cambridge Analytica.","A leading QC who spends a lot of time in the investigatory powers tribunal said that the problem with this technology was that it all depended on whose hands it was in.","“On the one hand, it’s being done by companies and governments who say ‘you can trust us, we are good and democratic and bake cakes at the weekend’. But then the same expertise can also be sold on to whichever repressive regime.”","In Britain, we still trust our government. We respect our authorities to uphold our laws. We trust the rule of law. We believe we live in a free and fair democracy. Which is what, I believe, makes the last part of this story so profoundly unsettling.","The details of the Trinidad project finally unlocked the mystery that was AggregateIQ. Trinidad was SCL’s first project using big data for micro-targeting before the firm was acquired by Mercer. It was the model that Mercer was buying into. And it brought together all the players: the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, AggregateIQ, Chris Wylie, and two other individuals who would play a role in this story: Mark Gettleson, a focus group expert who had previously worked for the Lib Dems. And Thomas Borwick, the son of Victoria Borwick, the Conservative MP for Kensington.","When my article linking Mercer and Leave.EU was published in February, no one was more upset about it than former Tory adviser Dominic Cummings, the campaign strategist for Vote Leave. He launched an irate Twitter tirade. The piece was “full of errors & itself spreads disinformation” “CA had ~0% role in Brexit referendum”.","Questions had already been swirling about whether there had been any coordination between the Leave campaigns. In the week before the referendum, Vote Leave donated money to two other Leave groups – £625,000 to BeLeave, run by fashion student Darren Grimes, and £100,000 to Veterans for Britain, who both then spent this money with AggregateIQ.","The Electoral Commission has written to AggregateIQ. A source close to the investigation said that AggregateIQ responded by saying it had signed a non-disclosure agreement. And since it was outside British jurisdiction, that was the end of it. Vote Leave refers to this as the Electoral Commission giving it “a clean bill of health”.","On his blog, Dominic Cummings has written thousands of words about the referendum campaign. What is missing is any details about his data scientists. He “hired physicists” is all he’ll say. In the books on Brexit, other members of the team talk about “Dom’s astrophysicists”, who he kept “a tightly guarded secret”. They built models, using data “scraped” off Facebook.","Finally, after weeks of messages, he sent me an email. We were agreed on one thing, it turned out. He wrote: “The law/regulatory agencies are such a joke the reality is that anybody who wanted to cheat the law could do it easily without people realising.” But, he says, “by encouraging people to focus on non-stories like Mercer’s nonexistent role in the referendum you are obscuring these important issues”.","And to finally answer the question about how Vote Leave found this obscure Canadian company on the other side of the planet, he wrote: “Someone found AIQ [AggregateIQ] on the internet and interviewed them on the phone then told me – let’s go with these guys. They were clearly more competent than any others we’d spoken to in London.”","The most unfortunate aspect of this – for Dominic Cummings – is that this isn’t credible. It’s the work of moments to put a date filter on Google search and discover that in late 2015 or early 2016, there are no Google hits for “Aggregate IQ”. There is no press coverage. No random mentions. It doesn’t even throw up its website. I have caught Dominic Cummings in what appears to be an alternative fact.","But what is an actual fact is that Gettleson and Borwick, both previously consultants for SCL and Cambridge Analytica, were both core members of the Vote Leave team. They’re both in the official Vote Leave documents lodged with the Electoral Commission, though they coyly describe their previous work for SCL/Cambridge Analytica as “micro-targeting in Antigua and Trinidad” and “direct communications for several PACs, Senate and Governor campaigns”.","And Borwick wasn’t just any member of the team. He was Vote Leave’s chief technology officer.","This story may involve a complex web of connections, but it all comes back to Cambridge Analytica. It all comes back to Mercer. Because the connections must have been evident. “AggregateIQ may not have belonged to the Mercers but they exist within his world,” David told me. “Almost all of their contracts came from Cambridge Analytica or Mercer. They wouldn’t exist without them. During the whole time the referendum was going on, they were working every day on the [Ted] Cruz campaign with Mercer and Cambridge Analytica. AggregateIQ built and ran Cambridge Analytica’s database platforms.”","Cummings won’t say who did his modelling. But invoices lodged with the Electoral Commission show payments to a company called Advanced Skills Institute. It takes me weeks to spot the significance of this because the company is usually referred to as ASI Data Science, a company that has a revolving cast of data scientists who have gone on to work with Cambridge Analytica and vice versa. There are videos of ASI data scientists presenting Cambridge Analytica personality models and pages for events the two companies have jointly hosted. ASI told the Observer it had no formal relationship with Cambridge Analytica.","Here’s the crucial fact: during the US primary elections, Aggregate IQ signed away its intellectual property (IP). It didn’t own its IP: Robert Mercer did. For AggregateIQ to work with another campaign in Britain, the firm would have to have had the express permission of Mercer. Asked if it would make any comment on financial or business links between “Cambridge Analytica, Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon, AggregateIQ, Leave.EU and Vote Leave”, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said: “Cambridge Analytica did no paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU.”","This story isn’t about cunning Dominic Cummings finding a few loopholes in the Electoral Commission’s rules. Finding a way to spend an extra million quid here. Or (as the Observer has also discovered )underdeclaring the costs of his physicists on the spending returns by £43,000. This story is not even about what appears to be covert coordination between Vote Leave and Leave.EU in their use of AggregateIQ and Cambridge Analytica. It’s about how a motivated US billionaire – Mercer and his chief ideologue, Bannon – helped to bring about the biggest constitutional change to Britain in a century.","Because to understand where and how Brexit is connected to Trump, it’s right here. These relationships, which thread through the middle of Cambridge Analytica, are the result of a transatlantic partnership that stretches back years. Nigel Farage and Bannon have been close associates since at least 2012. Bannon opened the London arm of his news website Breitbart in 2014 to support Ukip – the latest front “in our current cultural and political war”, he told the New York Times.","Britain had always been key to Bannon’s plans, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee told me on condition of anonymity. It was a crucial part of his strategy for changing the entire world order.","“He believes that to change politics, you have to first change the culture. And Britain was key to that. He thought that where Britain led, America would follow. The idea of Brexit was hugely symbolically important to him.”","On 29 March, the day article 50 was triggered, I called one of the smaller campaigns, Veterans for Britain. Cummings’s strategy was to target people in the last days of the campaign and Vote Leave gave the smaller group £100,000 in the last week. A small number of people they identified as “persuadable” were bombarded with more than a billion ads, the vast majority in the last few days.","I asked David Banks, Veterans for Britain’s head of communications, why they spent the money with AggregateIQ.","“I didn’t find AggegrateIQ. They found us. They rang us up and pitched us. There’s no conspiracy here. They were this Canadian company which was opening an office in London to work in British politics and they were doing stuff that none of the UK companies could offer. Their targeting was based on a set of technologies that hadn’t reached the UK yet. A lot of it was proprietary, they’d found a way of targeting people based on behavioural insights. They approached us.”","It seems clear to me that David Banks didn’t know there might have been anything untoward about this. He’s a patriotic man who believes in British sovereignty and British values and British laws. I don’t think he knew about any overlap with these other campaigns. I can only think that he was played.","And that we, the British people, were played. In his blog, Dominic Cummings writes that Brexit came down to “about 600,000 people – just over 1% of registered voters”. It’s not a stretch to believe that a member of the global 1% found a way to influence this crucial 1% of British voters. The referendum was an open goal too tempting a target for US billionaires not to take a clear shot at. Or I should say US billionaires and other interested parties, because in acknowledging the transatlantic links that bind Britain and America, Brexit and Trump, so tightly, we also must acknowledge that Russia is wrapped somewhere in this tight embrace too.","For the last month, I’ve been writing about the links between the British right, the Trump administration and the European right. And these links lead to Russia from multiple directions. Between Nigel Farage and Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica.","A map shown to the Observer showing the many places in the world where SCL and Cambridge Analytica have worked includes Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Iran and Moldova. Multiple Cambridge Analytica sources have revealed other links to Russia, including trips to the country, meetings with executives from Russian state-owned companies, and references by SCL employees to working for Russian entities.","What Brexit should have taught us about voter manipulation | Paul Flynn","Read more","Article 50 has been triggered. AggregateIQ is outside British jurisdiction. The Electoral Commission is powerless. And another election, with these same rules, is just a month away. It is not that the authorities don’t know there is cause for concern. The Observer has learned that the Crown Prosecution Service did appoint a special prosecutor to assess whether there was a case for a criminal investigation into whether campaign finance laws were broken. The CPS referred it back to the electoral commission. Someone close to the intelligence select committee tells me that “work is being done” on potential Russian interference in the referendum.","Gavin Millar, a QC and expert in electoral law, described the situation as “highly disturbing”. He believes the only way to find the truth would be to hold a public inquiry. But a government would need to call it. A government that has just triggered an election specifically to shore up its power base. An election designed to set us into permanent alignment with Trump’s America.","Martin Moore of King’s College, London, pointed out that elections were a newly fashionable tool for would-be authoritarian states. “Look at Erdoğan in Turkey. What Theresa May is doing is quite anti-democratic in a way. It’s about enhancing her power very deliberately. It’s not about a battle of policy between two parties.”","This is Britain in 2017. A Britain that increasingly looks like a “managed” democracy. Paid for by a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us.

The initial wave of this scandal began last week when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy, had acquired information on more than 50 million Facebook users via an app that accessed that information through the Facebook platform several years ago.","Last week, Zuckerberg said in one of several interviews that, “if it ever the case that I am the most informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify, I will happily do that.” Clearly, it appears that Congress wants the chief executive officer of the formerly-$500 billion advertising-driven business to be the one to do the explaining amid the increased fallout over the Cambridge Analytica debacle.","While Facebook is not unfamiliar with privacy snafus, this appeared to be one of the final straws, forcing Facebook CEO to issue a sort of non-apology-ish apology — as well as take out full page (in wildly not-very-engaging full text form, weirdly enough) ads in several major newspapers. Zuckerberg in particular has been a face absent in front of Congress, but it appears the pressure from this incident may be too much for the company to handle without getting his face out there in order to neutralize the fallout.","Facebook offered CTO Mike Schroepfer and chief product officer Chris Cox to meet with the UK committee this morning, but Zuckerberg again was absent there. Indeed, it was several days following the Cambridge Analytica reports that Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg made a formal statement in the form of Facebook posts, as well as a number of interviews with various media outlets to try to explain themselves out of the situation.","We reached out to Facebook for a comment and will update the post when we hear back."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Kogan had developed a personality prediction app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that compiled personal information from people based on what they liked on Facebook.","Through his company, Global Science Research, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica paid roughly 270,000 people to download the app and take a personality test, per the Guardian report.","The demo helped Cambridge Analytica compile information not only from the users who took part in Kogan’s research, but from their friends’ profiles as well, exposing millions of users’ data.

That means that around 300,000 people could sign up for a personality test quiz, and in the process hand over information of 150 times that number.Now, however, Facebook apps are only allowed to gather information from users who have directly signed up for them, greatly limiting their reach. That change was made in 2014, and rolled out to every Facebook app over the course of 2015.But it’s still the case that apps which you have directly enabled can harvest a significant amount of data from your account – often information which you might be surprised to know you’re handing over.The app settings page on Facebook is the place to manage the apps you’ve given access to. Clicking on the link will bring up a list of apps under “logged in with Facebook”. Hopefully you’ll recognise most of them – if there’s any you don’t, consider clicking the “X”, deauthorising them from your account.You might also want to click on the edit button under the “apps others use” heading lower down the page. This takes you to your privacy settings for the modern version of the same feature Cambridge Analytica profited from. The information others can hand over on your behalf is limited, but still includes data such as your date of birth, religious and political views, and activities, interests and things you like. Consider unchecking all the boxes. According to Facebook, leaving them all checked will make your friends’ “experience better and more social”, which doesn’t seem like a good trade-off for you.If that’s not enough for you to feel safe, maybe now’s the time to delete your Facebook account altogether.That’s somewhat harder to do. If you go through the account settings, Facebook will attempt to push you to “deactivate” your account, which “will disable your profile and remove your name and photo from most things that you’ve shared on Facebook”. Notably, it won’t remove any of your data from Facebook’s servers, and your account lies dormant hoping you will change your mind.If you actually want to delete your information from Facebook, the real setting is hidden in a help document with the title “how do I permanently delete my account?” Clicking on “let us know” on that page will take users to the real account deletion screen. Clicking “delete my account” will take you to another screen. Filling in your password and proving you aren’t a robot on that screen will finally… deactivate your account. Wait two weeks after that, and then, at long last, Facebook will begin the 90 day process of deleting all your data from the site.By September, then, you too could be Facebook-free.","Thecomputerheale.com makes no claims about the efficacy of the information contained in the documents and related graphics published on this website for any purpose.

Mozilla, Tesla and other companies are distancing themselves from Facebook following revelations of a major leak of user data to political consultants associated with the 2016 Trump campaign.","LONDON — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company's subscribers. The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.","A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.","The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.","\"For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,\" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. \"I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.\"","The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.","EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized \"the right to be forgotten,\" allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.","Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.","In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.","But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.","A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.","Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.","\"The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,\" said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.","The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.","While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.","The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking \"I Agree.\" The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.","To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.","Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.","Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to \"bracket off\" European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.","Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.","\"Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,\" she said.","Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. \"We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,\" it says.","But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.","Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.","\"Cambridge Analytica's story sounds like a spy novel,\" he said. \"It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix. It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer. It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon. It is working for right-wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds,\" he said. \"We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively.\"","Get today’s top stories right in your inbox.

I’ve written multiple articles over the years warning people about the platform (links at the end), but these mostly fell on deaf ears.","That’s just the way things go. All sorts of horrible behaviors can continue for a very long time before the corporate media and general public come around to caring. You typically need some sort of external event to change mass psychology. In this case, that event was Trump winning the election.","The more I read about the recent Facebook scandal, it’s clear this sort of thing’s been going on for a very long time. The major difference is this time the data mining was used by campaign consultants of the person who wasn’t supposed to win. Donald Trump.","Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.","Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach…","Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.","“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it”…","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying”…","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","This is deeply unethical and sleazy behavior, but it also was routine for years before the Cambridge Analytica news.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems”…","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","There’s a lot to process, so let’s recap the key points. Until around 2014, Facebook allowed app developers to harvest data of not only the people who actually downloaded the app and gave permission, but also the data of the app users’ friends without their knowledge. It’s hard to overstate how sleazy and unethical this is.","When internal employees, such as Sandy Parakilas, noted the glaring issues with such practices and voiced them to management, he was repeatedly ignored and advised to look the other way. It was completely obvious to Mr. Parakilas that a black market for the data of millions was being unleashed into the wild due to Facebook’s shady policy.","Rampant data harvesting by third parties was routinely going on way before Cambridge Analytica came into the picture, and academic research highlighted the problem all the way back in 2010. Finally, Mr. Parakilas suspects the reason Facebook backed away from this sleazy practice wasn’t due to ethical or privacy concerns, but because executives feared others would collect enough user information from the company to eventually compete with it in the data mining business.","Where were these worries four years ago for the much larger and arguably more manipulative effort by the Obama campaign?","Instead of using a personality quiz, the Obama campaign merely got a portion of its core supporters to use their Facebook profiles to log into a campaign site. Then they used well-tested techniques of gaining consent from that user to harvest all their friends’ data. Sasha Issenberg gushed about how the Obama campaign used the same permissions structure of Facebook to extract the data of scores of millions of Facebook users who were unaware of what was happening to them. Combining Facebook data with other sources such as voter-registration rolls, Issenberg wrote, generated “a new political currency that predicted the behavior of individual humans. The campaign didn’t just know who you were; it knew exactly how it could turn you into the type of person it wanted you to be.”","The level of data sophistication was so intense that Issenberg could describe it this way:","Obama’s campaign began the election year confident it knew the name of every one of the 69,456,897 Americans whose votes had put him in the White House. They may have cast those votes by secret ballot, but Obama’s analysts could look at the Democrats’ vote totals in each precinct and identify the people most likely to have backed him. Pundits talked in the abstract about reassembling Obama’s 2008 coalition. But within the campaign, the goal was literal. They would reassemble the coalition, one by one, through personal contacts.","Today’s Cambridge Analytica scandal causes our tech chin-strokers to worry about “information” you did not consent to share, but the Obama team created social interactions you wouldn’t have had. They didn’t just build a psychological profile of persuadable voters, and algorithmically determine ways of persuading them, but actually encouraged particular friends — ones the campaign had profiled as influencers — to reach out to them personally. In a post-election interview, the campaign’s digital director Teddy Goff explained the strategy: “People don’t trust campaigns. They don’t even trust media organizations,” he told Time’s Michael Sherer, “Who do they trust? Their friends?” This level of manipulation was celebrated in the press.","How did Facebook react to the much larger data harvesting of the Obama campaign? The New York Times reported it out, in a feature hailing Obama’s digital masterminds:","The campaign’s exhaustive use of Facebook triggered the site’s internal safeguards. “It was more like we blew through an alarm that their engineers hadn’t planned for or knew about,” said [Will] St. Clair, who had been working at a small firm in Chicago and joined the campaign at the suggestion of a friend. “They’d sigh and say, ‘You can do this as long as you stop doing it on Nov. 7.’ ”","In other words, Silicon Valley is just making up the rules as they go along. Some large-scale data harvesting and social manipulation is okay until the election. Some of it becomes not okay in retrospect. They sigh and say okay so long as Obama wins. When Clinton loses, they effectively call a code red.","What’s genius when it helps Obama, is suddenly a threat to Democracy when Trump wins. The truth is, it was dangerous and unethical before and it’s dangerous and unethical now.","A former Obama campaign official lit up the internet on Monday after claiming that Facebook allowed them to mine massive amounts of Facebook data because “they were on our side.”","Now, comments she made in 2015 are shining even more light on exactly how extensive the data mining effort was — and how it may have given Democrats an “unfair” data advantage going forward.","Carol Davidsen, former director of integration and media analytics for Obama for America, said the Obama campaign was able to “ingest the entire social network” in the United States.","“Where this gets complicated is, that freaked Facebook out, right? So they shut off the feature,” she added. “Well, the Republicans never built an app to do that. So the data is out there, you can’t take it back, right? So Democrats have this information”…","“I’m a Democrat, so maybe I could argue that’s a great thing, but really it’s not in the overall process,” Davidsen said. “That wasn’t thought all the way through and now there’s a disadvantage of information that, to me, seems unfair. But I’m not Facebook.”","Here are the relevant tweets.","They came to office in the days following election recruiting & were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.","What’s going on here is pretty obvious. Mainstream press and “resistance” pundits have finally decided to care about the pernicious practices of a platform monopoly only because the wrong guy won. I’m fine with this, since I don’t really care why we decide to address serious societal issues, as long as we do address them.","That said, the danger is scores of dishonest actors are trying to hijack the narrative and make this only about Trump and Cambridge Analytica, versus a long-standing systemic issue of predatory practices that have always been central to Facebook’s business model. Monetizing your information.","It’s a topic I’ve written about many times over the years. Here are a few of those pieces:"],"isopubdate":""}

Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company.

His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","How to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely","Read more","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself.

In the eyes of then-Rep. Edward J. Markey and Rep. Joe Barton, the company had failed its users in allowing app developers to take personal data from them and their friends — and transmit it to marketers.","Fretting that those “series of breaches of consumer privacy” had affected millions on the social site, the bipartisan duo then sought to issue Facebook a subtle warning, touting the “comprehensive privacy legislation [that] is currently pending” on Capitol Hill.","Such legislation never passed. Almost eight years later, though, Facebook is once again under fire for a privacy mishap involving millions of users’ personal details landing in the hands of a third party, Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm that worked for the Trump campaign. And some members of Congress are once again threatening to act.","“I think that this privacy spill is politically the equivalent of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico,” said Markey, now a senator from Massachusetts, in an interview Thursday. “Because it involves our very democracy, I think [it] is going to draw more attention of the American public to this issue.”","The new catalyst is Cambridge Analytica. Facebook last week said the data firm in 2015 wrongfully obtained names, “likes” and other personal information from at least 30 million Facebook users, which it used to help create “psychographic” profiles of voters. In response, Cambridge Analytica said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","The incident, revealed last week, still has exposed Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to unprecedented criticism. The social networking company’s stock tumbled, wiping away billions of dollars in value. It took days for Zuckerberg to publicly address the crisis — and when he finally did, on Wednesday, he suggested there are “things like ads transparency regulation that I would love to see.”","A spokesman for Facebook didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday, though, Zuckerberg personally pledged to “learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward.”","Policymakers in the United States and around the world didn’t wait for Zuckerberg to speak to start scrutinizing the company, hoping that Facebook’s mistakes — and a general, turning political tide against the tech industry — might finally help them tame web giants’ appetites for consumers’ personal information.","On Friday, a powerful group of lawmakers, the Senate Commerce Committee, became the second panel on Capitol Hill to invite Zuckerberg to testify. Its leaders, Republican Chairman John Thune (S.D.) and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson (Fla.), said in a statement they hoped to press the Facebook chief executive on his “plans to restore lost trust, safeguard users’ data, and end a troubling series of belated responses to serious problems.” And several investigations are underway, including at the Federal Trade Commission, which could slap Facebook with fines that spill into the millions of dollars.","“I think the allegations here absolutely highlight the limited rights Americans have to their data, and [they] should tee up a conversation about the kind of protections we need for the digital age,” Democratic FTC Commissioner Terrell McSweeny said in an interview. She declined to comment on the agency’s probe.","For now, the U.S. government isn’t totally lacking in laws that govern the ways that companies collect, swap and sell data. There are strict rules that govern the privacy of Americans’ financial transactions and health records, for example, and there are special protections for children younger than 13 who browse the Web.","But there’s nothing in federal rule books that requires tech giants, advertising behemoths and other barons of the digital economy to obtain a Web user’s permission every time they collect a specific piece of data about their online activity or swap or sell it with a third party. Companies like Facebook and Google aren’t required to minimize the volume of data they collect or delete it after a certain period of time, either.","Meanwhile, a key U.S. enforcement agency, the FTC, is strictly limited in its ability to issue fines. Often, it can only slap tech companies with major financial penalties on their second offense. Technically, its governing statute doesn’t mention privacy; it’s just supposed to probe those companies that act unfairly or deceive consumers, including those online. And the agency is severely hamstrung in its ability to write its own rules, too.","McSweeny, the FTC commissioner, said her agency should have “some kind of civil penalty authority” so it can punish the worst abusers.","Newly, though, McSweeny said she supported a “substantial policy conversation around the kind of data practices” used by firms like Cambridge Analytica. That includes psychographics, and “really powerful analytics and automated technology,” and “AI-driven systems that can be used for misinformation on a massive scale.”","“I think we should take these warnings for what they are,” she said.","To Republican Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), meanwhile, there are myriad unresolved troubles with the Web — including terrorists who use it as a recruiting tool and “manipulation by foreign governments and intelligence services,” he said in an interview. “And then you’ve got the fact that data can be used for political purposes, probably outside people’s imaginations.”","Asked whether he believed that would merit a new law on these and other issues, Graham replied: “The long-winded answer is: yes.”","Zuckerberg’s early, broad support for greater regulation in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy contrasts with the years of lobbying by Facebook and its tech peers in D.C. to stave off any new rules that would restrict the information they collect — the lifeblood of their business models.","“I think the tech sector has been enormously effective at arguing about all the benefit it provides through the explosion of digital commerce, and has been able to constantly push back against privacy legislation,” said Gene Kimmelman, the president of Public Knowledge, a D.C.-based consumer group.","In 2016, for example, the Federal Communications Commission under President Barack Obama sought to issue new privacy rules for the Internet. At the time, a top trade group for the tech industry, the Internet Association, urged the agency to leave companies like Facebook and Google untouched, focusing its efforts instead on providers like AT&T and Comcast.","Last year, an effort by Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.) that would require these tech companies to obtain customers’ permission before selling their data to advertisers drew sharp opposition from a wide array of players, including Facebook and Google. Together, they shelled out nearly $30 million in lobbying expenses in 2017 on a range of issues, including a campaign to fight her proposal, according to federal records.","And Facebook joined with Google, Comcast and others this year in fighting a ballot measure in California that would allow consumers to opt out from having their information shared with advertisers while opening the companies to new lawsuits if they suffer data breaches. Facebook so far has spent about $200,000 to try to defeat the idea, state ethics records reflect.","In response, the tech industry stressed it isn’t unregulated or uncooperative.","“The internet industry routinely works with lawmakers and regulators as they evaluate legislative and regulatory proposals,” Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association, said in a statement. “Our companies comply with a wide variety of regulations, including on privacy, and frequently take part in the regulatory process on a host of issues. We will continue to be a productive part of the privacy conversation in the U.S. and around the world.”","Some Republicans in Congress also have been wary of additional regulation, raising the specter that any push to rein in the privacy practices of Facebook and the rest of Silicon Valley still faces a tough climb.","For example, in the aftermath of Facebook’s missteps, Thune, the Commerce Committee chairman, said it would “depend on how they react, what they decide to do on their own.”","Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), meanwhile, acknowledged this week that “most people would be surprised at how much data mining takes place, how much information these companies acquire to sell advertising and to sell to third parties for various purposes,” he said. But on regulation, he added: “I would want to get information first before we consider something like that.”","For Markey, those statements suggest that political obstacles remain even years after one of his earlier warnings about Facebook — “given the deregulatory philosophy of Republicans combined with the still great monetary power of the tech community,” he said.","“But,” Markey added in an interview, “I’m eternally optimistic. That’s why I’m still here. I do know that the moment is coming.”","Tony RommTony Romm is a technology policy reporter at The Washington Post.

The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

If users had not adjusted their privacy settings on the social media outlet, however, the app didn’t just capture the survey responses — it also gathered as much data from each account as possible.","That data included information from Facebook users’ friends and contacts, as well.","\"So by you filling out my survey I capture 300 records on average right,\" Wylie told ITN Channel 4 News. \"And so that means that, all of a sudden, I only need to engage 50,000, 70,000, 100,000 people to get a really big data set really quickly, and it’s scaled really quickly. We were able to get upwards of 50 million plus Facebook records in the span of a couple of months.\"","Similar stories based on the same reporting also appeared in the New York Times and the Observer of London.","According to Wylie, the project was of particular importance to Steve Bannon, who later served as the chief executive of Trump's campaign. He added that the former head of the right-wing media organization Breitbart wanted to use the data netted by Cambridge Analytica to influence and galvanize the views of the American public.","\"Steve wanted weapons for his culture war, that’s what he wanted,\" Wylie said.","\"We offered him a way to accomplish what he wanted to do, which was change the culture of America,\" Wylie added.","A Cambridge Analytica spokesman refuted all of Wylie's claims, calling his decision to speak to the media \"a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\"","\"We were forced to take action against Mr. Christopher Wylie to prevent his misuse of the company's intellectual property and he is the subject of restraining undertakings in this regard,\" the spokesman said. \"It is clear that he has a grudge to bear and appears set on trying to damage the company.\"","But Wylie said in the initial interview that this wasn’t about getting back at Cambridge Analytica, noting that \"if it was about revenge I could have done this years ago.\"","Instead, Cambridge Analytica’s former director of research calls his whistleblowing a crisis of conscience.","\"It weighs on me that I played a pivotal role in setting up a company that I think has done a lot of harm to the democratic process in a lot of countries,\" Wylie said.","The idea behind the project was that political preferences can be predicted by personal details people voluntarily provide on their social media accounts.

The news that Facebook's Android app has been collecting call and text histories is yet another black eye for the social media giant. The social network acknowledged on Sunday, March 25, 2018, that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015 - first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)","How Facebook was able to siphon off phone call and text logs","How Facebook was able to siphon off phone call and text logs","By RYAN NAKASHIMA and MAE ANDERSON","Mar. 27, 2018","https://apnews.com/3bb6a06ca1f343b2be3a446f014da873","Link copied!","The news that Facebook's Android app has been collecting call and text histories is yet another black eye for the social media giant. But just why was Facebook able to siphon off records of who its users were contacting — and when — in the first place?","The short answer: Because Google let it. The longer answer: Well, it's complicated.","The social network acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015 — first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app. Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected, that it didn't collect the contents of messages or calls, and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings.","Facebook did not respond to multiple requests for more specifics. The kerfuffle over this data collection, first reported by the website Ars Technica , follows a week of turmoil for the social network involving charges that it allowed political consultants to steal the data of 50 million users in order to influence elections.","There's a reason Facebook's actions were restricted to Android phones. Apple locks down app permissions tightly, which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users. \"Apple's fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running, and keep customers in control of the information,\" said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security firm Securosis.","But Android has long been more indulgent.","Until recently, in fact, Google let app developers gain access to a phone's call and text logs. All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts. Once users agreed, Android would then also grant access to those communication histories.","Starting in 2012 with its \"Jelly Bean\" release, Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs, but still required them to agree to all those permissions at once. Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn't work.","It wasn't until 2015 when Google released Android 6.0, dubbed \"Marshmallow,\" that Android phones finally split up those permissions. That meant users could agree to share contacts, but reject access to their messaging and phone histories.","That's the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information. But many Android users aren't using the latest version of the software. In fact, they often can't get it even if they want it.","Apple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones, which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will. Google, by contrast, is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions.","There are nearly 20,000 Android phone models now in service, and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks. As a result, new Android versions reach users very slowly.","As of January, about 65 percent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software, introduced in 2017. Less than 1 percent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android, known as \"Oreo.\" (Many of them are owners of Google's new Pixel phones, which get software updates directly from Google.)","Just over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions, which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs. Last October, Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates, even on phones running older versions of Android.","All that leaves two big questions unanswered. Why did Google set up Android permissions this way? And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup?","Experts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google's advertising-based business model, which — like Facebook — depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads. Apple, meanwhile, derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music.","Another possible factor: Android was playing catch-up with Apple for many years, and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple's App Store. Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive — as Facebook did.","Experts say it's not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts, but it's very possible.","\"In a lot of ways, Facebook is the tip of the iceberg,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. \"There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection.\"","It is unclear how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users' call logs had been sent to app developers. A Google spokesperson declined to comment.","One major Android phone maker expressed uncertainty over its role in protecting user privacy. \"At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution,\" LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday in a statement.","___","AP Technology Writer Youkyung Lee in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report."],"isopubdate":""}

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

A New Poll Shows Americans Trust Facebook Less Than Its Big Tech Counterparts","In the midst of ongoing backlash from the alleged misuse of personal user data, Facebook is earning less trust from Americans than other key players in the Big Tech space, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll.","When asked how much they trust a selection of tech companies to obey data privacy protection laws, 41% of Americans say they trust Facebook, while 51% do not.","Out of the same set of respondents, 66% say they trust Amazon to obey data privacy protection laws, while 62% trust Google. The audience was also asked the same question about Microsoft (60% trust), Apple (53%), and Yahoo (48%).","The poll results, which were released on Sunday, came shortly before the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) confirmed it will be conducting a non-public investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. It's not the social network's first run-in with this particular federal agency -- in 2011, it also had to settle FTC charges after failing to make good on several promises regarding user privacy.","2. Facebook, Meanwhile, Continues to Make News Feed Changes: This Time, With Local News","Facebook announced yesterday it would continue to prioritize local news in users' News Feeds: a change that was first announced in January, while being tested in six U.S. cities.","Now, according to yesterday's announcement, the change will be rolling out \"in all countries, in all languages.\"","The statement, written by Facebook's Head of News Product Alex Hardiman and Head of News Partnerships Campbell Brown, notes these changes to the News Feed algorithm will allow users to see more news \"from local sources covering their current city and other cities they may care about.\"","According to the initial January pilot, a \"local\" news source is defined by the number of clicks its links receive by users in a certain geographic area. That means, for a user in a given region, stories from these sources are more likely to appear higher in the News Feed if you follow their Pages, or your friends share content from them.","But with this update, the scope of \"local\" is a bit more flexible -- and now, \"we’ll consider a publisher as local to multiple cities if the people in those cities are more likely than the people outside of those cities to read articles from the publisher’s domain,\" write Hardiman and Brown.","These changes appear to be part of Facebook's ongoing efforts to emphasize personal-network-focused content in the News Feed. That overarching change to the algorithm was also first announced in January, following initial revelations the network had been weaponized to spread misinformation and divisive content to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.","3. Uber Is Exiting Southeast Asia","In an email to the company's Southwest Asia staff, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi confirmed that the ride-hailing app would be exiting that region, and selling its shares to its largest competitor there: Grab.","Grab, which describes itself as \"O2O mobile platform\" (online-to-offline), currently operates across six countries in the region, including Singapore and Thailand. For Uber, this is not the first major international market exit of this nature -- in China, one of its largest geographical competitors, Didi, acquired Uber's business in that country in 2016. And in Europe, Uber merged with Russian competitor Yandex.Taxi last July, ceasing its operations there.","\"One of the potential dangers of our global strategy is that we take on too many battles across too many fronts and with too many competitors,\" wrote Khosrowshahi. \"This transaction now puts us in a position to compete with real focus and weight in the core markets where we operate.\"","To some, those \"core markets\" are the U.S. and Europe, where SoftBank -- Uber's largest shareholder following a $9.3 billion investment in January -- has verbally stressed it wants the company to focus its efforts.","The deal with Grab will leave Uber with a 27.5% stake in what Khosrowshahi called \"the combined company,\" where roughly 500 Uber employees will be working once the transition is complete.","The news comes on the heels of a fatal incident involving one of Uber's self-driving cars in Arizona last week, which has led to the suspension of autonomous vehicle testing by several manufacturers -- including, according to Recode's Johana Bhuiyan, Toyota and Nvidia.","4. Twitter Has Officially Banned Cryptocurrency Ads","Following rumors it might join its counterparts at Facebook and Google, Twitter has officially banned ads pertaining to cryptocurrency.","According to Reuters, the new policies will prohibit ads pertaining to both cryptocurrency sales, as well as initial coin offerings (ICO). The rules are said to have rolled out yesterday -- and the following appears on Twitter's Restricted Content Policies for financial services:","The announcement comes among suspicions that Twitter, as well as Facebook and Google, might be facing government regulation that it has seemingly sought to avoid. Following recent allegations that personal Facebook user data was misused by bad actors, the CEOs of all three companies have been invited to testify before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee (Zuckerberg has been asked to appear before two additional congressional committees, as well, and there are reports he has agreed), raising questions about the potential of a federal gatekeeping role in the area of user privacy.","It's also worth noting that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force this May, which concerns the personal data of EU citizens -- leaving many wondering if a U.S. version might be on the horizon.","5. Apple Unveiled An \"Affordable\" iPad for Students","At a press event in Chicago yesterday, Apple announced it would be selling a new 9.7-inch iPad at a lower price point with a certain audience in mind: students. The product unveil came ahead of the company's June World Wide Developers Conference.","In keeping with the theme of education -- the event was held at Chicago's Lane Tech high school -- Apple also announced the iPad will be available for $299 for students and schools, compared to $329 for other consumers. It's also designed to work with Apple Pencil: a digital wand that allows users to draw and write on the device screens as they might with a pen.","Before this announcement, the Apple Pencil was only supported by the (pricier) iPad Pro, and wasn't included. Instead, it had to be purchased separately for $99.","With this newest product release, the Apple Pencil still has to be purchased separately, but it's available at a lower price point for students and schools at $89 (the price point for other consumers is $99). That makes the total combined product cost just shy of $400, or more if users also choose to purchase a keyboard.","Compare that to the very first Chromebook tablet, which was unveiled the day before Apple's event, and is also priced at $329 -- and according to Google's official announcement, it comes with a stylus -- a similar digital pen -- inside the package.","It's also being positioned as a product particularly fitting for the education sector, with the benefits to students outlined in the product launch announcement, including the tablet's augmented reality (AR) capabilities that will allow students to simulate such experiences as looking \"into the eye of a miniature Category 5 hurricane or ... a strand of DNA.\"","Promotion around Apple's new iPad also emphasizes its \"immersive AR experiences\" that allow students to simulate activities like dissections.","What Else Is Going Down in Tech Town?","Facebook Is Updating Its Privacy Tools","Facebook has announced new privacy tools that are expected to make it easier for users to understand and control their personal data. Here's what to expect. Read full story >>","No Smart Speaker from Facebook ... For Now","Facebook has reportedly shelved its plans to unveil an AI-powered smart speaker at its May 2018 F8 developer conference.

However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

{"originalurl":"https://which-50.com/cover-story-why-this-breach-why-did-the-facebook-cambridge-analytica-story-finally-cut-through/","title":"Cover Story: Why this breach? Why the Facebook Cambridge Analytica story finally cuts through - Which-50","text":["The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal has hastened the inevitable backlash against rampant data collection and micro-targeting online. And it’s threatening to deliver a wave of regulation behind it.","The story first broke as a result of a joint investigation by The Observer and The New York Times a week ago, but many in the industry familiar with the way Facebook operates could be initially forgiven for underestimating the magnitude of the story.","Because what is now being presented as shocking — the use of social data to target the aspirations and fears of consumers — is basically standard operating procedure for your typical digital marketer.","After all, what Cambridge Analytica did wasn’t new. Indeed, that was how the Facebook platform for developers was designed to work at the time.","As Which-50 writer John Birmingham noted on his Alien Side Boob blog (on Facebook, ironically), “Mark Zuckerberg’s complaint that what they did was unauthorised and unfair is like a mad scientist complaining, ‘I built a monster-making machine, and people used it to make monsters’.”","But the details of what happened, when married to the toxic political climate in the US that Cambridge Analytica helped create, and in the midst of a long-running investigation into Russian interference in US elections, makes this data-privacy story more dramatic.","Unlike many massive data breaches of recent years — which consumers routinely shrugged off — this breach of privacy, enabled by Facebook’s wide-reaching surveillance and incompetent governance, struck a chord with the public (bad for Facebook) and with regulators (existentially awful for Facebook).","Ay, there’s the rub for Zuckerberg and the rest of the leadership team at Facebook. They are not really concerned about a wave of defections from their social network, but they are terrified that regulators will change the rules around how data can be used. That would threaten their spectacularly successful business model.","Facebook’s share price plummeted ten per cent as traders immediately priced a tougher and more unfavourable regulatory environment into its valuation. By last Thursday the company had lost $57 billion in market value.","It fell again after the FTC confirmed it had launched an investigation.","According to Tom Pahl, Acting Director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, “The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers. Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honour their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act.”","His statement also noted that companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements.","“Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.”","As well as the FTC probe, the company now faces investigations by multiple US state attorneys-general, and questions from officials in Europe — including the UK’s Information Commissioner, whose staff raided Cambridge Analytica last week in London.","Facebook said it will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before it changed its platform “to dramatically reduce data access in 2014”. Any developer that doesn’t pass the audit will be banned from the social media network. Users will be notified if it is discovered their data has been misused, including those who downloaded — or whose friends downloaded — Thisisyourdigitallife, the app that was used to harvest the information given to Cambridge Analytica.","All of which is to say this story isn’t going away anytime soon.","Graphic: Which-50","The furore comes after months of debate about whether technology giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon should be broken up and/or more closely regulated. Some kind of regulation seems inevitable now, even if it is slow-moving.","Along with Europe’s incoming GDPR regulation, the scandal gives data-driven decision makers reason to pause. Businesses that are making big investments in technology stacks based on collecting consumer data are faced with the reality that this technology investment might be superseded by a change in consumer attitudes or regulation.","The advice from Benjamin Bloom, Gartner Research Director for Marketing Technology and Emerging Trends, isn’t to abandon their efforts — but to invest in building “their own war chests of consumer data”.","“My research on this topic has shown that marketers must increase their awareness and investment in analytics and customer data technologies to gain customer experience advantages and to insulate them from the whims of scaled digital platforms such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon,” Bloom told Which-50.","Google, Facebook and Amazon offer powerful data-driven solutions, but limit the portability of data that marketers need for measurement and insights. That means marketers will need to make their own investments to future-proof their marketing tactics.","Building a wall","“The ‘walled gardens’ have become increasingly powerful in tracking users across platforms and devices. Recent changes from Apple have had a material impact on the tracking of users on mobile devices. It is incumbent upon brands to build their own war chests of consumer data and to ensure that they provide fair value back to the customer when collecting their data.”","Ad buyers will explore tactics which will still give them reach with zero liability, according to an agency exec speaking to Digiday.","Turning to the subject of trust, the high-profile scandal will likely make consumers more suspicious of marketers’ methods and motives.","“Marketers should be on alert that response to marketing content, offers and messages could be affected by the perception that brands are out to manipulate their audiences,” Bloom warns.","“They must tread carefully the line between personalised or targeted, and creepy. The line between a 1:1 customer journey and an invasion of personal space is being more closely monitored.”","Bloom argues that marketers and data professionals already hold themselves to a generally higher standard when it comes to safeguarding personal data.","“Data and BI professionals in leading companies adopt a ‘privacy by design’ approach to storing consumer data: storing as little as is needed to deliver needed functionality or personalisation, and using encryption and access control to reduce the risk of consumer information being revealed,” Bloom says.","Facebook’s handling of the Cambridge Analytica debacle over the years before the story became public serves as a reminder that security and privacy aren’t interchangeable. Internet giants may be the best in the world for security, for example, but not necessarily privacy.","“If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn’t have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third party ticking a box on a form wouldn’t free the company from responsibility, then it had no business collecting anyone’s data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalisation, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance.”","Who’s leading the backlash","Advertisers can’t, and probably won’t, walk away from buying ads on the platform.","According to Gartner’s The State of US Advertising, 2017-2018, Google and Facebook together will take in 72 per cent of digital ad revenue earned by all digital publishers, ad networks and ad tech vendors in the US. That’s up from 69 per cent in 2016.","Similarly, consumers are unlikely to desert the platform in a way that will materially impact the company’s bottom line despite the emergence of a #DeleteFacebook campaign.","Earlier this year, L2 Founder and NYU Stern Professor Scott Galloway told Which-50 he believes the two cohorts that will lead the battle against big tech will be regulators and parents.","“Consumers talk a big game about supply chain ethics and then want a little black dress for $9.99. They claim to care about their privacy and then less than one per cent clear their cookies. So this revolution will not be consumer-led,” Galloway said.","Instead, Galloway — an advocate for breaking up Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon — argues that European regulators and concerned parents will be the ones to cause headaches for Facebook.","“I think it will be led by regulators out of Europe and parents globally who are starting to observe their kids having more what I’ll call emotional stress and strain at the hands of social media platforms,” Galloway said.","In Australia, Information and Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim said last week that his office is making inquiries with Facebook to determine whether Australians were affected by the Cambridge Analytica data breach.","It’s not the end of the World (Wide Web)","In response to the scandal, World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee struck an optimistic tone, saying all can be repaired.","“This is a serious moment for the Web’s future. But I want us to remain hopeful. The problems we see today are bugs in the system. Bugs can cause damage, but bugs are created by people, and can be fixed by people,” Berners-Lee tweeted.","“General rules for us all: Any data about me, wherever it is, is mine and mine alone to control. If you are given the right to use data for one purpose, use it for that purpose alone.”","Why now?","So why is this moment different to all the previous huge and arguably more global breaches? Theft of medical data, for instance, is arguably more problematic — and more common. Likewise, credit card and financial data.","And as Facebook said — in a typically tin-eared response last week — this wasn’t even a breach. The original researcher who hoovered up Facebook’s data, Aleksandr Kogan, did so legitimately. He then passed it to Cambridge Analytica illegitimately.","His Russian-sounding name, the fact that he worked in St Petersberg, and had Russian clients at the same time, only added to the delicious madness of the story. (As did the fact that he briefly changed his surname to Spectre — the acronym for the international organisation for evil in the original James Bond novels. You can’t make this stuff up.)","We asked marketing, communication and media professionals to tell us why they felt this story has cut through like none previously (for instance, Facebook was pinged by the FTC in 2011, but no one much cared at the time).","According to Janine Peres, founder and CEO of Thinksmart Marketing, a Sydney-based marketing agency, “Like all significant change events, the collective pain threshold was finally met.”","Pares told Which-50 the context is important. “[There is] a growing undercurrent of fear of the power and control of the big platforms like Facebook and Google — we hate the data they hold on us all, and we worry about what they might use that data for — but we also benefit from that data and so we tolerate the fear and the pain (how bad could it be, right?).","“But it was US President Donald Trump’s unexpected November 2016 election win that really explains why this story is reverberating. Depending on your politics, Trump is either a welcome disruptor to a corrupt world order, or a Russian intelligence asset. If you’re an independent, both might be true.","“People are demanding to know why and how. His win also sent Cambridge Analytica straight into the mainstream as the hero (or villain) of the Trump win. Our greatest fears have been realised in ways we couldn’t have predicted. Data is used to influence election outcomes. Now it’s real and it impacts regulators, politicians, and everyday people. It’s too big a price to pay to do nothing.”","Carolyn Loton, owner and director of Juntos Marketing, said “we are only just now starting to see the outcomes of the social experiment we are all living through. The level of social connection through Facebook, as well as the total lack of regulation — the lawlessness of social media — both are unprecedented. So this Cambridge Analytica breach of privacy tangibly demonstrates what has been hypothetical in a way until now, yet is what we all fear.”","The final word goes to Simon Sharwood, APAC editor of global tech media title The Register, and an occasional Which-50 contributor.","“This was everyone’s half-articulated fears made real in both the private and public spheres. We all fear the loss of personal privacy. We’ve all learned to fear weaponised information. This realises both those fears at once.”","The Author","Tess Bennett","Tess Bennett is the editor of Which-50 and is responsible for leading the publication’s daily coverage of Australia's digital businesses for C-Suite executives, strategists, founders and directors.

What have you guys found out?","ANGELO CARUSONE (MEDIA MATTERS PRESIDENT): So there's two things that I would point out as the way they used it. One is they used it for advertising. So they used the data in part to help engage in what was essentially a suppression or a neutralization campaign -- sort of target voters that are unlikely to vote for Trump or likely to vote for Hillary Clinton -- with deceptive messages or, in some cases, completely fabricated storylines to just keep them home, right? To depress their vote. But the second thing I think is more insidious, and it's something that most people aren't discussing, but it is of great concern to me, and that's that there's a lot of indicia out there that it's not just that the campaign was actually using Cambridge's services, but that they actually replicated the dataset as a part of their larger Project Alamo. In particular, Brad Parscale,who is now the campaign manager but then was the digital director, talked about the fact that they were linking and combining three databases, what the Trump campaign had already had prior to their contract with Cambridge Analytica when Cambridge came on board in August, and then lastly the RNC's data.

Photograph: Cliff Owen/AP","The US military is developing software that will let it secretly manipulate social media sites by using fake online personas to influence internet conversations and spread pro-American propaganda.","A Californian corporation has been awarded a contract with United States Central Command (Centcom), which oversees US armed operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, to develop what is described as an \"online persona management service\" that will allow one US serviceman or woman to control up to 10 separate identities based all over the world.","The project has been likened by web experts to China's attempts to control and restrict free speech on the internet. Critics are likely to complain that it will allow the US military to create a false consensus in online conversations, crowd out unwelcome opinions and smother commentaries or reports that do not correspond with its own objectives.","The discovery that the US military is developing false online personalities – known to users of social media as \"sock puppets\" – could also encourage other governments, private companies and non-government organisations to do the same.","The Centcom contract stipulates that each fake online persona must have a convincing background, history and supporting details, and that up to 50 US-based controllers should be able to operate false identities from their workstations \"without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries\".","He said none of the interventions would be in English, as it would be unlawful to \"address US audiences\" with such technology, and any English-language use of social media by Centcom was always clearly attributed. The languages in which the interventions are conducted include Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and Pashto.","Centcom said it was not targeting any US-based web sites, in English or any other language, and specifically said it was not targeting Facebook or Twitter.","Once developed, the software could allow US service personnel, working around the clock in one location, to respond to emerging online conversations with any number of co-ordinated messages, blogposts, chatroom posts and other interventions. Details of the contract suggest this location would be MacDill air force base near Tampa, Florida, home of US Special Operations Command.","It also calls for \"traffic mixing\", blending the persona controllers' internet usage with the usage of people outside Centcom in a manner that must offer \"excellent cover and powerful deniability\".","The multiple persona contract is thought to have been awarded as part of a programme called Operation Earnest Voice (OEV), which was first developed in Iraq as a psychological warfare weapon against the online presence of al-Qaida supporters and others ranged against coalition forces. Since then, OEV is reported to have expanded into a $200m programme and is thought to have been used against jihadists across Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Middle East.","OEV is seen by senior US commanders as a vital counter-terrorism and counter-radicalisation programme. In evidence to the US Senate's armed services committee last year, General David Petraeus, then commander of Centcom, described the operation as an effort to \"counter extremist ideology and propaganda and to ensure that credible voices in the region are heard\". He said the US military's objective was to be \"first with the truth\".","Centcom confirmed that the $2.76m contract was awarded to Ntrepid, a newly formed corporation registered in Los Angeles. It would not disclose whether the multiple persona project is already in operation or discuss any related contracts.","Nobody was available for comment at Ntrepid.","In his evidence to the Senate committee, Gen Mattis said: \"OEV seeks to disrupt recruitment and training of suicide bombers; deny safe havens for our adversaries; and counter extremist ideology and propaganda.\" He added that Centcom was working with \"our coalition partners\" to develop new techniques and tactics the US could use \"to counter the adversary in the cyber domain\".","Asked whether any UK military personnel had been involved in OEV, Britain's Ministry of Defence said it could find \"no evidence\". The MoD refused to say whether it had been involved in the development of persona management programmes, saying: \"We don't comment on cyber capability.\"","It is unclear whether a persona management programme would contravene UK law. Legal experts say it could fall foul of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, which states that \"a person is guilty of forgery if he makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or another shall use it to induce somebody to accept it as genuine, and by reason of so accepting it to do or not to do some act to his own or any other person's prejudice\". However, this would apply only if a website or social network could be shown to have suffered \"prejudice\" as a result.","• This article was amended on 18 March 2011 to remove references to Facebook and Twitter, introduced during the editing process, and to add a comment from Centcom, received after publication, that it is not targeting those sites."],"isopubdate":"2011-03-17"}

It will now take a Herculean effort to restore public trust in Facebook's commitment to privacy and data protection, they said. Outside observers think regulation has suddenly become more likely, and yet CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears missing in action.","The scandal also highlights a problem that is built into the company's DNA: Its business is data exploitation. Facebook makes money by, among other things, harvesting your data and selling it to app developers and advertisers. Preventing those buyers from passing that data to third parties with ulterior motives may ultimately be impossible.","Indeed, the most alarming aspect of Cambridge Analytica's \"breach\" is that it wasn't a breach at all. It happened almost entirely above board and in line with Facebook policy.","Aleksandr Kogan, a University of Cambridge professor, accessed the data of more than 50 million Facebook users simply by creating a survey filled out by 270,000 people. Facebook provided Kogan with the data of anyone who took the survey, as well as their friends' data. In a statement, Facebook said, \"Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time.\"","The one rule Kogan violated, according to Facebook, was passing the user data to third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm founded by former Trump aide Steve Bannon and conservative donor Robert Mercer.","But even Facebook sources acknowledged to CNN that it is impossible to completely monitor what developers and advertisers do with the data once it's in their hands. It's like selling cigarettes to someone and telling them not to share the cigarettes with their friends.","The limits of Facebook's ability to enforce compliance with data usage was highlighted by Facebook's own response to Kogan's violation. Facebook says it learned of Kogan's violation in 2015 and was subsequently assured by all parties that the data had been destroyed. But Facebook also says it learned just days ago that \"not all data was deleted.\"","In a statement, Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said \"protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do.\" That may be a hard argument for the public to accept given that Facebook's business is providing people's information to outside parties whose ultimate goals are unknowable.","Facebook says that starting in 2014 it gave users greater control over what parts of their information are shared with app developers and advertisers. It also says it has enhanced its app review process to require developers \"to justify the data they're looking to collect and how they're going to use it — before they're allowed to even ask people for it.\"","Still, the sources inside Facebook acknowledge that such measures cannot guarantee that some people won't succeed in mining Facebook data and passing it off to third parties.","On Capitol Hill, the talk of regulation is growing louder. Lawmakers seeking tighter restrictions on big tech feel even more emboldened than they did in the wake of revelations about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a source on Capitol Hill told CNN.","Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar has called on Zuckerberg to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which she serves, to explain \"what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters.\"","Meanwhile, Zuckerberg and the rest of the Facebook leadership seem conspicuously absent. Neither the Facebook CEO nor his top deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, have commented publicly on the matter. They have left that task to Grewal, a lawyer. No one has provided an adequate explanation for why Facebook did not disclose Kogan's violation to the more than 50 million users who were affected when the company first learned about it in 2015.","\"We are conducting a comprehensive internal and external review and are working to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information,\" Grewal said in a statement Sunday.","All of this comes as Facebook is already getting questions about the long-term appeal of its platform, at least in the United States. The number of daily active users in the United States — a whopping 184 million — declined for the first time last quarter. Facebook also lost 2.8 million users under the age of 25 last year, and is set to lose another 2 million this year, according to eMarketer.","The Cambridge Analytica scandal is likely to hasten user disenchantment with the network, sources inside Facebook acknowledged. Facebook is increasingly being seen as a platform vulnerable to manipulation by political groups, foreign governments, or worse.","Ultimately, however, the real culprit in the eyes of the American public may not be Cambridge Analytica or the Russians, but rather Facebook itself."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

It's also a move that will have very tangible affects on Facebook's business, as many marketers rely on this type of data to target ads on the platform.","How it works: Facebook previously let marketers target advertisers using three types of data. They are now shutting down the tool that let them use the third type of data listed below to target ads.","First-party data, or data users give to Facebook upon using the service, like birthdays, workplace and data through engagement (photo ploads, likes, etc.)","Advertiser data, or data that advertisers bring to Facebook to target, like a catalog list or a list or potential voters.

This type of data typically comes from back-end business-to business technology firms, like Acxiom, Experian.","Be smart: It's a common industry practice to use third-party data to target ads online, especially on big tech platforms like Facebook. Traditional publishers and many of Facebook's technology competitors do this often. This move will give Facebook a less competitive edge in ad sales, but the company thinks it's worth it given the chaos that's surrounded their data policies over the past few weeks.","\"We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories. This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.\"","— Graham Product, Marketing Director","Our thought bubble: Facebook made roughly $13 billion dollars on ad revenue last quarter, with almost all of that ad that revenue coming from programmatic, or automated ads.

His attorney, Tamsin Allen, said in a statement early Sunday that when Facebook became aware of the articles about to published about data harvesting at the social media giant, the company \"privately welcomed\" his help -- and then publicly suspended his account.","Facebook announced Friday night that it had suspended Wylie along with a researcher at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan and the consulting company Strategic Communication Laboratories -- the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. In the release about the suspension, Facebook said Kogan had passed along data harvested from a digital app to Cambridge Analytica and Wylie and lied to Facebook about deleting the data.","Facebook's release about the suspensions came just hours before exposés about the company's practices were published in The New York Times and the Guardian. Wylie spoke to both outlets, saying he and Kogan \"exploited\" Facebook.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles,\" Wylie told the Guardian. \"And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"","According to the Guardian, data was harvested from 50 million profiles and Facebook failed to inform uses and did little to recover the data. Although only 270,000 downloaded Kogan's app, there was a loophole at Facebook at the time that allowed app developers to not only see the data of people who downloaded the app but also everyone in that user's friend network, Wired senior reporter Issie Lapowsky told CBSN Saturday.","Wylie's attorney, Tamsin Allen, said in a statement when Facebook learned about the articles, the company \"privately welcomed\" his help but then criticized him publicly and suspended his account.","\"This behavior is more consistent with damage limitation than with a genuine attempt to resolve a serious problem,\" Allen said. \"None of this would have been revealed without Mr Wylie speaking out and taking his share of responsibility. Facebook should be doing the same rather than simply blaming others.\"","A Facebook spokesperson has since responded saying: \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account.

They've just really got to do better,\" she said.","In a statement via his attorney, Wylie said he \"helped set up\" Cambridge Analytica when he was 23 years old and he says he now feels \"a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world.\" Cambridge Analytica pushed back against the claim that he was a founder, tweeting Saturday that Wylie was a \"contractor.\"","Cambridge Analytica insisted Saturday that Kogan's company, Global Science Research (GSR) harvested the data. The company said once it learned GSR sold it data that it shouldn't have, it deleted the data.","Cambridge Analytica became a household name in 2016 after it was hired by the Trump campaign's digital guru, Brad Parscale.

It is our job to help keep it secure for them,\" she said. To illustrate the increase in regulations, Johnson who was in Mumbai on Monday cited the example of Europe which has introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regime, which tech companies have to adhere to.","It can be noted that following the revelations that data of over 50 million Facebook users could have been illegally accessed for influencing electoral results by the London-based consultancy Cambridge Analytica, the social network had volunteered to be regulated more closely.","Johnson said technology alone can help overcome the present set of worries which allegedly owe its genesis to misuse of the technology itself. \"Technology can actually help the problem that is surfacing now.","Things like blockchain can be a part of the solution here, because it is transparent, it is secure... It can actually be a part of the solution to some of these concerns that are being raised by the regulators,\" she said, adding her company is already building on such solutions through its cloud platform Azure.","She said the company has been working on cybersecurity and has helped as many as 125 Indian companies with protecting their data since launching the offering in mid-2016 through a dedicated centre that works closely with academia as well.","On the recent car crash involving a driverless car in the US, which killed one pedestrian, Johnson said Uber did the right thing by stalling the autonomous car experiments and added that more simulation using the tech is the solution to avoid any mishaps in the future.","\"I think AI (artificial intelligence) can help that situation. I think if you can gather data and run simulations, rather than actual cars (on the road),\" she said. \"Stopping the testing was right thing to do till they (Uber) analyse what went wrong there.

Johnson said the company wants to \"democratise AI\" tools and is already working on the healthcare and the agriculture sector in the country.","In healthcare, the interventions are focused on the oncology or cancer diagnosis and treatment front, and also ophthalmology, while in agriculture, it has a tie-up with a state-run institute.","The AI-led interventions have led to a 30 per cent increase in productivity for the farmers, and also helped in preserving the quality of the soil, she said, underlining that the latter is very important from a sustainability perspective.","For Breaking News from OneindiaGet instant news updates throughout the day.","We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)","News reports about Facebook’s role in the aggressive form of data collection have raised serious questions about whether the company violated a landmark consent decree with a federal watchdog agency designed to prevent privacy violations.","Share story","U.S. and European officials Sunday called for Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how personal information about tens of millions of users ended up in the hands of a data-analysis firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign — without the permission or knowledge of the vast majority of those affected.","News reports about Facebook’s role in the aggressive form of data collection also have raised serious questions about whether the company violated a landmark consent decree with a federal watchdog agency designed to prevent privacy violations.","Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines.","“I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,” said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree.","Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the “maximum exposure” could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences.","Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social-media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond.","The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015.","But the number of affected people was many more — likely in the tens of millions — because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user’s list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches.","Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement.","Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,” Schiff said in an interview Sunday. “There’s still a lot we’re learning about foreign issues on these platforms.”","Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union’s justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said Sunday. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.”","At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate.","Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica’s actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook’s systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company’s terms of service, at least initially.","Facebook suspended the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook’s request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor’s role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring.","The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica’s app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent decree with the FTC.","In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend’s data were used by third-party developers such as Cambridge.","In November 2011, the FTC faulted Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social-media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

Nearly $40 billion was wiped off Facebook’s market value Monday, an emergency meeting is due to be held Tuesday morning, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been criticized for remaining silent during what some analysts are describing as a threat to the company’s existence.","Zuckerberg has been summoned to the British parliament to give evidence about the how it handles people's personal data. The head of a British inquiry into 'fake news,' Damian Collins, has accused Facebook of previously 'misleading' a parliament committee, adding: \"It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process.\"","As anger grew toward Cambridge Analytica on Monday after Britain’s Channel 4 broadcast a report showing company executives boasting about their extreme propaganda strategies, including filming opponents in compromising situations with Ukrainian sex workers, authorities in the U.K. and the U.S. also questioned whether Facebook mishandled the alleged breach and it’s now facing damaging investigations that will further tarnish its brand.","Britain’s information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, confirmed she was applying to the courts for a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s London offices and said Tuesday morning that she has been left frustrated by the company’s reluctance to cooperate with her investigation.","Fears have also been raised that the investigation may have been compromised by the presence of cybersecurity consultants from Stroz Friedberg—the company hired by Facebook to audit Cambridge Analytica on its behalf—who were in the London offices on Monday evening, until they were asked to leave by the information commissioner.","Asked if there was a risk of Cambridge Analytica or Facebook destroying evidence, Denham said on Sky News: “As this point we’re not satisfied with the cooperation we’re getting from Cambridge Analytica, so the next step is for us to apply to the court and to do an audit to get some answers as to whether data was misused and shared inappropriately.”","British Parliament Culture Committee Chairman Damian Collins said: “This is a matter for the authorities. Facebook sent in data analysts and lawyers who they appointed. What they intended to do there, who knows? The concern would have been, were they removing information or evidence which could have been vital to the investigation? It’s right they stood down but it’s astonishing they were there in the first place.”","Denham said Facebook itself will be subject to an investigation over its actions, saying: “We are looking at whether or not Facebook secured and safeguarded personal information on the platform and whether when they found out about the loss of the data they acted robustly and whether or not people were informed.”","In the U.S., Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) has called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) sent a letter to the Facebook CEO to inquire about the company’s policies for sharing user data with third parties. It’s unlikely Zuckerberg will appear before Congress, as the company usually sends lawyers in place of company figures.","Congress has also called on Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Alexander Nix to be hauled in for questioning. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said it was particularly pressing for Nix to be interviewed after reports that the academic who worked on the data-harvesting tool, Aleksandr Kogan, also received grants from the Russian government to research Facebook users’ emotional states.","Schiff said: “Reports that an American professor with links to Russia was at the center of this illicit transfer of information raises further questions, which the committee must investigate. Despite our request, and as set out in our status report, the committee has not had the opportunity to talk with numerous Cambridge Analytica personnel who may have knowledge of this and other issues—they must now be brought in for interviews.”","The whistleblower who raised the misuse of data, Christopher Wylie, also raised the links between Cambridge Analytica and Russia on Tuesday, saying on NBC News: “This company misappropriated data of upwards of 50 million people from Facebook. They misused that data. That data was processed by psychologists who were going back and forth between London and Russia, who are also working on projects in Russia for Russians.","“This company was using this data meanwhile as it was talking to the second largest oil company of Russia [and] sending work that I was doing to the CEO of Lukoil, which has known links with the Russian FSB ,which is their state security services. I think we need to step back for a second and depoliticize this because this is about the safety of Americans and the integrity of the American democratic process.”","Wylie also told CNN that Cambridge Analytica tested possible Trump slogans, such as “drain the swamp” and “build that wall,” as early as 2014—before his presidential run was announced.","Wylie said: “A lot of these narratives which at the time would have seemed crazy for a mainstream candidate to run on, those were the things we were finding there were pockets of Americans who this really appealed to. Steve Bannon knew that, because we were doing the research on it.”","“We were testing these narratives well before Trump even announced.”","Meanwhile, a new whistleblower and former Facebook insider told The Guardian that hundreds of millions of people are likely to have had their data harvested by companies using similar methods as Cambridge Analytica. He said he warned warned senior executives at the company that its poor data protection risked a major breach.","“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” said Sandy Parakilas."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report.","Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of Kogan's data was used in its 2016 election work for the \"avoidance of doubt.\"","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","The Facebook blog post, written by deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\"","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Trump's general-election campaign.","Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","\"The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\"","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.","A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.","The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.","Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August.

Nix said Assange denied the request, which came after Assange had said publicly that he had the emails. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.","Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling.","Revelations that Cambridge Analytica misused social media data could also be of interest to Mueller's investigation. While much of the thrust of special counsel's investigation has been tightly held, Mueller has requested that the firm turn over the emails of any employees who worked on the campaign, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last year.","Mueller is also looking at the role Wikileaks played in acquiring and making public the stolen Clinton campaign emails."],"isopubdate":""}

Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebook’s official post.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” the added language argued.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","While the language is up for debate, lawmakers don’t appear to be looking kindly on Facebook’s arguably legitimate effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.)","While most lawmakers and politicians haven’t crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebook’s chief executive — and not just its counsel — to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee.","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I’ve called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in tech’s role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to “prevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.”","“This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,” Warner said in a statement. “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”","That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healey’s office for additional information.","On Cambridge Analytica’s side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a “broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.”","“Now is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,” said Nuala O’Connor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. “Internet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.”","Just what lawmakers intend to do about big tech’s latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out.","I am a self‐learned digital executive, leader, strategist and trainer by profession and experience.

Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The Brobdingnagian numbers tell much of the story. In 1994, four years after the first Internet browser was created, Bezos stumbled upon a startling statistic: the Internet had been growing at the rate of 2,300 percent annually. In 1995, the year Bezos, then 31, started Amazon, just 16 million people used the Internet. A year later, the number was 36 million, a figure that would multiply at a furious rate. Today, more than 1.7 billion people, or almost one out of every four humans on the planet, are online. Bezos understood two things. One was the way the Internet made it possible to banish geography, enabling anyone with an Internet connection and a computer to browse a seemingly limitless universe of goods with a precision never previously known and then buy them directly from the comfort of their homes. The second was how the Internet allowed merchants to gather vast amounts of personal information on individual customers.","The Internet permitted a kind of bespoke selling. James Marcus, who was hired by Bezos in 1996 and would work at Amazon for five years, later published a revealing memoir of his time as Employee #55. He recalls Bezos insisting that the Internet, with “its bottomless capacity for data collection,” would “allow you to sort through entire populations with a fine-tooth comb. Affinity would call out to affinity: your likes and dislikes—from Beethoven to barbecue sauce, shampoo to shoe polish to Laverne & Shirley—were as distinctive as your DNA, and would make it a snap to match you up with your 9,999 cousins.” This prospect, Marcus felt, “was either a utopian daydream or a targeted-marketing nightmare.”","Related Article","Whichever one it was, Bezos didn’t much care. “You know, things just don’t grow that fast,” he observed. “It’s highly unusual, and that started me thinking, ‘What kind of business plan might make sense in the context of that growth?’” Bezos decided selling books would be the best way to get big fast on the Internet. This was not immediately obvious: bookselling in the United States had always been less of a business than a calling. Profit margins were notoriously thin, and most independent stores depended on low rents. Walk-in traffic was often sporadic, the public’s taste fickle; reliance on a steady stream of bestsellers to keep the landlord at bay was not exactly a sure-fire strategy for remaining solvent.","Still, overall, selling books was a big business. In 1994 Americans bought $19 billion worth of books. Barnes & Noble and the Borders Group had by then captured a quarter of the market, with independent stores struggling to make up just over another fifth and a skein of book clubs, supermarkets and other outlets accounting for the rest. That same year, 513 million individual books were sold, and seventeen bestsellers each sold more than 1 million copies. Bezos knew that two national distributors, Ingram Book Group and Baker & Taylor, had warehouses holding about 400,000 titles and in the late 1980s had begun converting their inventory list from microfiche to a digital format accessible by computer. Bezos also knew that in 1992 the Supreme Court had ruled in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota that retailers were exempt from charging sales tax in states where they didn’t have a physical presence. (For years, he would use this advantage to avoid collecting hundreds of millions of dollars in state sales taxes, giving Amazon an enormous edge over retailers of every kind, from bookstores to Best Buy and Home Depot. In recent months, however, Amazon, under mounting pressure, has eased its opposition and reached agreements with twelve states, including California and Texas, to collect sales tax.) “Books are incredibly unusual in one respect,” Bezos said, “and that is that there are more items in the book category than there are items in any other category by far.” A devotee of the Culture of Metrics, Bezos was undaunted. He was sure that the algorithms of computerized search and access would provide the keys to a consumer kingdom whose riches were as yet undiscovered and barely dreamed of, and so he set out to construct a twenty-first-century ordering mechanism that, at least for the short term, would deliver goods the old-fashioned way: by hand, from warehouses via the Postal Service and commercial shippers.","2","3","4","5","One of Amazon’s consultants was publishing visionary Jason Epstein. In 1952 Epstein founded Anchor Books, the highbrow trade paperback publisher; eleven years later he was one of the founders of the New York Review of Books, and for many decades was an eminence at Random House. His admiration for Bezos was mixed with a certain bemusement; he knew that for Amazon to really revolutionize bookselling, physical books would have to be transformed into bits and bytes capable of being delivered seamlessly. Otherwise, Bezos would have built only a virtual contraption hostage to the Age of Gutenberg, with all its cumbersome inefficiencies. But Epstein could not fathom that the appeal of holding a physical book in one’s hand would ever diminish. Instead, he dreamed of machines that would print on demand, drawing upon a virtual library of digitized books and delivering physical copies in, say, Kinkos all across the country. The bookstores that might survive in this scenario would be essentially stocking examination copies of a representative selection of titles, which could be individually printed while customers lingered at coffee bars awaiting the arrival of their order. Ultimately, Epstein would devote himself to this vision.","Bezos looked elsewhere, convinced that one day he could fashion an unbroken chain of ordering and delivering books, despite the deep losses Epstein warned he’d have to sustain to do so. But first he had to insert the name of his new company into the frontal lobe of America’s (and not only America’s) consumers. Like all great and obsessed entrepreneurs, his ambitions were imperial, his optimism rooted in an overweening confidence in his own rectitude. He aimed to build a brand that was, in Marcus’s phrase, “both ubiquitous and irresistible.” A decade before, while a student at Princeton in the mid-1980s, he had adopted as his credo a line from Ray Bradbury, the author of Fahrenheit 451: “The Universe says No to us. We in answer fire a broadside of flesh at it and cry Yes!” (Many years later, the octogenarian Bradbury would decry the closing of his beloved Acres of Books in Long Beach, California, which had been unable to compete with the ever-expanding empire of online bookselling.) A slightly built, balding gnome of a man, Bezos often struck others as enigmatic, remote and odd. If not exactly cuddly, he was charismatic in an otherworldly sort of way. A Columbia University economics professor who was an early boss of Bezos’ said of him: “He was not warm…. It was like he could be a Martian for all I knew. A well-meaning, nice Martian.” Bill Gates, another Martian, would welcome Bezos’ arrival to Seattle, saying, “I buy books from Amazon.com because time is short and they have a big inventory and they’re very reliable.” Millions of book-buyers would soon agree.","As the editor of the Los Angeles Times Book Review, I had watched Bezos’ early rise with admiration, believing that whatever complications he was bringing to the world of bookselling were more than compensated for by the many ways he was extending reader access to a greater diversity of books. After all, even the larger 60,000-square-foot emporiums of Barnes & Noble and Borders could carry no more than 175,000 titles. Amazon, by contrast, was virtually limitless in its offerings. Bezos was then, as he has been ever since, at pains to assure independent bookstores that his new business was no threat to them. He claimed that Amazon simply provided a different service and wasn’t trying to snuff bricks-and-mortar stores. Independent booksellers weren’t so sure.","* * *","In the mid- to late 1990s, when online bookselling was in its infancy, Barnes & Noble and Borders were busy expanding their empires, often opening stores adjacent to long-established community bookstores. The independents were alarmed by these and other aggressive strategies. The chain stores could give customers deeply discounted offerings on a depth of stock made possible by favorable publishers’ terms not extended to independents. Clerks at the chains might not intimately know the tastes and predilections of the surrounding neighborhood, but the price was right: lower was better, lowest was best.","The death toll tells the tale. Two decades ago, there were about 4,000 independent bookstores in the United States; only about 1,900 remain. And now, even the victors are imperiled. The fate of the two largest US chain bookstores—themselves partly responsible for putting smaller stores to the sword—is instructive: Borders declared bankruptcy in 2011 and closed its several hundred stores across the country, its demise benefiting over the short term its rival Barnes & Noble, which is nonetheless desperately trying to figure out ways to pay the mortgage on the considerable real estate occupied by its 1,332 stores across the nation. It is removing thousands of physical books from stores in order to create nifty digital zones to persuade customers to embrace the Nook e-book readers, the company’s alternative to Amazon’s Kindle. Persistent rumors that B&N’s owners wish to sell regularly sweep the corridors of publishing. But the very idea of owning a bookstore strikes most savvy investors as forlorn. In recent weeks, Microsoft Corp. decided to challenge Amazon by investing $605 million in B&N’s digital-book business, an arrangement that calls for sharing revenue from e-book sales and other content.","For many of us, the notion that bricks-and-mortar bookstores might one day disappear was unthinkable. Jason Epstein put it best in Book Business, his incisive 2001 book on publishing’s past, present and future, when he offered what now looks to be, given his characteristic unsentimental sobriety, an atypical dollop of unwarranted optimism: “A civilization without retail bookstores is unimaginable. Like shrines and other sacred meeting places, bookstores are essential artifacts of human nature. The feel of a book taken from the shelf and held in the hand is a magical experience, linking writer to reader.”","That sentiment is likely to strike today’s younger readers as nostalgia bordering on fetish. Reality is elsewhere. Consider the millions who are buying those modern Aladdin’s lamps called e-readers. These magical devices, ever more beautiful and nimble in design, have only to be lightly rubbed for the genie of literature to be summoned. Appetite for these idols, especially among the young, is insatiable. For these readers, what counts is whether and how books will be made available to the greatest number of people at the cheapest possible price. Whether readers find books in bookstores or a digital device matters not at all; what matters is cost and ease of access. Walk into any Apple store (temples of the latest fad) and you’ll be engulfed by the near frenzy of folks from all walks of life who seemingly can’t wait to surrender their hard-earned dollars for the latest iPad, Apple’s tablet reader, no matter the constraints of a faltering economy. Then try to find a bookstore. Good luck. If you do, you’ll notice that fewer books are on offer, the aisles wider, customers scarce. Bookstores have lost their mojo.","* * *","The bookstore wars are over. Independents are battered, Borders is dead, Barnes & Noble weakened but still standing and Amazon triumphant. Yet still there is no peace; a new war rages for the future of publishing. The recent Justice Department lawsuit accusing five of the country’s biggest publishers of illegally colluding with Apple to fix the price of e-books is, arguably, publishing’s Alamo. What angered the government wasn’t the price, but the way the publishers seemed to have secretly arranged to raise it. Many publishers and authors were flabbergasted, accusing the Obama administration of having gone after the wrong culprit. Scott Turow, president of the Authors Guild, denounced the suit, as did David Carr, the media critic of the New York Times, who said it was “the modern equivalent of taking on Standard Oil but breaking up Ed’s Gas ‘N’ Groceries on Route 19 instead.” On its face, the suit seemed an antitrust travesty, a failure to go after the “monopolistic monolith” that is, as the Times put it, “publishing’s real nemesis.” In this view, the biggest threat is Amazon’s willingness to sell e-books at a loss in order to seduce millions of unwitting consumers into the leviathan’s cornucopia of online goods and services. What is clear is that “legacy publishing,” like old-fashioned bookselling, is gone. Just as bookselling is increasingly virtual, so is publishing. Technology democratizes both the means of production and distribution. The implications for traditional publishers are acute.","Amazon, not surprisingly, is keen to sharpen its competitive edge, to use every means at its disposal to confound, stymie and overpower its rivals. It is well positioned to do so: the introduction of the Amazon Kindle in 2007 led to a startling surge in e-book sales, which until then had been insignificant. Soon it was not unusual to see e-book sales jump by 400 percent over the previous year. An estimated 3 million e-readers were sold in 2009, the year Amazon began to sell its Kindle 2, the first e-reader available globally. Bezos called the Kindle a response to “the failings of a physical book…. I’m grumpy when I’m forced to read a physical book because it’s not as convenient. Turning the pages…the book is always flopping itself shut at the wrong moment.” Millions of people agreed and millions of Kindles were bought (though Amazon refuses to reveal exact numbers). Competing devices—including the Nook and the iPad, to name but two of the most prominent—began to proliferate and to give Amazon’s Kindle a run for its money, thanks to the e-book pricing arrangement between some publishers and Apple that attracted the ire of the Justice Department. Barely a year after Apple launched the iPad, it had sold more than 15 million worldwide. Just three years ago, only 2 percent of Americans had an e-reader or a tablet; by January of this year, the figure was 28 percent. And Amazon, despite watching its market share drop from 90 percent of the American e-book market in 2010 to about 55–60 percent today, reached a milestone just under three years after the Kindle was introduced. “Amazon.com customers now purchase more Kindle books than hardcover books,” Bezos crowed, “astonishing when you consider that we’ve been selling hardcover books for 15 years, and Kindle books for 33 months.”","How the Digital Age might alter attention spans and perhaps even how we tell one another stories is a subject of considerable angst. The history of writing, however, gives us every reason to be confident that new forms of literary excellence will emerge, every bit as rigorous, pleasurable and enduring as the vaunted forms of yesteryear. Perhaps the discipline of tapping 140 characters on Twitter will one day give rise to a form as admirable and elegant as haiku was in its day. Perhaps the interactive features of graphic display and video interpolation, hyperlinks and the simultaneous display of multiple panels made possible by the World Wide Web will prompt new and compelling ways of telling one another the stories our species seems biologically programmed to tell. Perhaps all this will add to the rich storehouse of an evolving literature whose contours we have only begun to glimpse, much less to imagine.","* * *","One thing, however, is certain, and about it publishers agree: e-book sales as a percentage of overall revenue are skyrocketing. Initially such sales were a tiny proportion of overall revenue; in 2008, for instance, they were under 1 percent. No more. The head of one major publisher told me that in 2010 e-book sales accounted for 11 percent of his house’s revenue. By the end of 2011 it had more than tripled to 36 percent for the year. As John Thompson reports in the revised 2012 edition of his authoritative Merchants of Culture, in 2011 e-book sales for most publishers were “between 18 and 22 percent (possibly even higher for some houses).” Hardcover sales, the foundation of the business, continue to decline, plunging 13 percent in 2008 and suffering similar declines in the years since. According to the Pew Research Center’s most recent e-reading survey, 21 percent of American adults report reading an e-book in the past year. Soon one out of every three sales of adult trade titles will be in the form of an e-book. Readers of e-books are especially drawn to escapist and overtly commercial genres (romance, mysteries and thrillers, science fiction), and in these categories e-book sales have bulked up to as large as 60 percent. E-book sales are making inroads even with so-called literary fiction. Thompson cites Jonathan Franzen’s Freedom, published in 2010 by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, one of America’s most distinguished houses and one of several American imprints now owned by the German conglomerate Holtzbrinck. Franzen’s novel sold three-quarters of a million hardcover copies and a quarter-million e-books in the first twelve months of publication. (Franzen, by the way, detests electronic books, and is also the guy who dissed Oprah when she had the gumption to pick his earlier novel, The Corrections, for her popular book club.) Did Franzen’s e-book sales depress his hardcover sales, or did the e-book iteration introduce new readers to his work? It’s hard to know, but it’s likely a bit of both.","The inexorable shift in the United States from physical to digital books poses a palpable threat to the ways publishers have gone about their business. Jason Epstein got it right two years ago when he wrote, “The resistance today by publishers to the onrushing digital future does not arise from fear of disruptive literacy, but from the understandable fear of their own obsolescence and the complexity of the digital transformation that awaits them, one in which much of their traditional infrastructure and perhaps they too will be redundant.” Traditional publishers, he argued, have only themselves to blame, many (perhaps even most) of their wounds having been self-inflicted. They have been too often complacent, allergic to new ideas, even incompetent. Their dogged and likely doomed defense of traditional pricing strategies has left them vulnerable to Amazon’s predatory pricing practices. Peter Mayer, former CEO of Viking/Penguin and now owner and publisher of the independent Overlook Press, agrees: “Publishers clearly need to newly prove to readers and authors the value that publishers add.” That value, he concedes, is no longer a given.","The inability of most traditional publishers to successfully adapt to technological change may be rooted in the retrograde editorial and marketing culture that has long characterized the publishing industry. As one prominent literary agent told me, “This is a business run by English majors, not business majors.” A surpassing irony: for years many of us worried that the increasing conglomeration of publishers would reduce diversity. (We were wrong.) We also feared bloated overheads would hold editors hostage to an unsustainable commercial imperative. (We were right.) But little did we imagine that the blunderbuss for change would arrive in the form of an avaricious imperium called Amazon. It is something of a surprise to see so many now defending the practices of corporate publishers who, just yesterday, were excoriated as philistines out to coarsen the general culture.","Epstein, for one, doesn’t fear Amazon, writing recently that the company’s “strategy, if successful, might force publishers to shrink or even abandon their old infrastructure.” Thus will publishing collapse into the cottage industry it was “in the glory days before conglomeration.” Epstein insists that the dialectic Amazon exemplifies is irreversible, “a vivid expression of how the logic of a radical new and more efficient technology impels institutional change.”","Not very long ago it was thought no one would read a book on a computer screen. That assumption is now demonstrably wrong. Today, whether writers will continue to publish the old-fashioned way or go over to direct online publishing is an open question. How it will be answered is at the heart of the struggle taking place between Amazon and traditional publishers.","* * *","Jeff Bezos got what he wanted: Amazon got big fast and is getting bigger, dwarfing all rivals. To fully appreciate the fear that is sucking the oxygen out of publishers’ suites, it is important to understand what a steamroller Amazon has become. Last year it had $48 billion in revenue, more than all six of the major American publishing conglomerates combined, with a cash reserve of $5 billion. The company is valued at nearly $100 billion and employs more than 65,000 workers (all nonunion); Bezos, according to Forbes, is the thirtieth wealthiest man in America. Amazon may be identified in the public mind with books, but the reality is that book sales account for a diminishing share of its overall business; the company is no longer principally a bookseller. Amazon is now an online Walmart, and while 50 percent of its revenues are derived from music, TV shows, movies and, yes, books, another 50 percent comes from a diverse array of products and services. In the late 1990s Bezos bought IMDb.com, the authoritative movie website. In 2009 he went gunning for bigger game, spending nearly $900 million to acquire Zappos.com, a shoe retailer. He also owns Diapers.com, a baby products website. Now he seeks to colonize high-end fashion as well. “Bezos may well be the premier technologist in America,” said Wired, “a figure who casts as big a shadow as legends like Bill Gates and the late Steve Jobs.”","With the introduction last fall of the Kindle Fire, Bezos is pushing an advanced mobile portal to Amazon’s cloud universe, which hosts Web operations for a wide variety of companies and institutions, including Netflix, the New York Times, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Tina Brown’s Newsweek/Daily Beast, PBS, Virgin Atlantic and the Harvard Medical School, among others. As Wired put it, when you buy the Kindle Fire, “you’re not buying a gadget—you’re filing citizen papers for the digital duchy of Amazonia.” For his part, Daniel Ellsberg of Pentagon Papers fame recently renounced his “citizenship,” pulling the plug on his Amazon Prime membership and calling for a boycott of Amazon after he discovered that the company had buckled under pressure from Washington and scrubbed WikiLeaks from its Web servers. Not unlike small independent bookstores, bricks-and-mortar retailers such as Walmart, Home Depot and Best Buy are feeling the ground give way beneath them. Target is fighting back, declaring that it will no longer sell Kindles, clearly dismayed by Amazon’s brazen promotion of a price-checking app as a means of competing with many of the goods that Target sells.","Amazon has sixty-nine data and fulfillment centers, seventeen of which were built in the past year alone, with more to come. For the thousands of often older migratory baby boomers living out of RVs, who work furiously at the centers filling customer orders at almost literally a breakneck pace, it is, by all accounts, a high-stress job. These workers are the Morlocks who make possible Amazon’s vaunted customer service. Last fall, the Morning Call investigated their plight in one of Amazon’s main fulfillment warehouses in Allentown, Pennsylvania. It found that some employees risked stroke and heat exhaustion while running themselves ragged trying to fulfill quotas that resemble the onerous conditions so indelibly satirized by Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times. Ambulances were routinely stationed in the facility’s giant parking lot to rush stricken workers to nearby hospitals. Amazon, for its part, says such problems are exceptional, and indeed by OSHA’s standards incidents of this kind are not the norm. Pursuing greater efficiencies, Amazon in March bought Kiva Systems Inc., a robot manufacturer, for $775 million. Kiva, founded in 2003 and backed by, among others, Bain Capital Ventures, claims that three to four times as many orders per hour can be packed up by a worker using its robots. For Bezos the Martian, the human factor is pesky. Now a more automated solution looms.","* * *","In spring 2011 Amazon announced that it was hiring publishing veteran Larry Kirshbaum, former CEO of the Time-Warner Book Group, to head Amazon Publishing in New York. Kirshbaum was all but condemned by many of his publishing comrades as an apostate. Others were puzzled: Why, they wondered, would Amazon, having so spectacularly led the e-book revolution and done so much, in the words of one of its spokesmen, to “re-invent reading,” seek to become a player in the rearview world of publishing books on paper? Doing so would require building an entire infrastructure of editors, publicists and even sales representatives who would be charged with convincing America’s booksellers—by now allergic to the very idea of aiding their most agile adversary—to carry its books. Indeed, Barnes & Noble, among other booksellers, promptly said it would not sell any book published by Amazon. (It should be remembered that B&N had once tried to become a publisher itself through its purchase of Sterling Publishing, raising howls of “conflict of interest” from publishers. The perennial question of whose ox is being gored fairly begs to be asked here.) For its part, Amazon swiftly struck an alliance with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to handle placing its books in physical stores. In a transparent subterfuge aimed at protecting its tax-avoidance strategies, Amazon intends to publish many of its books under a subsidiary imprint of Houghton’s called New Harvest, thus keeping alive the increasingly threadbare fiction that it has no physical presence in states where it does business online.","Nine months after Kirshbaum’s hire, judging by the number of deals concluded, his nascent operation rivals two of publishing’s largest companies, the French-owned Hachette and the Murdoch-owned HarperCollins. Like his boss, Kirshbaum wants to get big fast. It remains to be seen, however, whether spending a reported $800,000 to acquire Penny Marshall’s Hollywood memoirs is ultimately profitable; a number of the publishers I spoke with thought not and professed little anxiety at Amazon’s big-foot approach. They are not inclined to join the hysteria that largely greeted Kirshbaum’s defection, feeling that a recent Bloomberg Businessweek cover story depicting a book enveloped by flames had exaggerated by several orders of magnitude the actual threat posed by Amazon’s new venture. If Amazon wants to burn the book business, as the magazine’s headline blared, publishing books the old-fashioned way struck them as a peculiar way of going about it. Was there really a “secret plot to destroy literature,” as the magazine alleged? It seemed far-fetched, to say the least.","At the same time, Amazon’s New York foray might be seen as an effort to lure “legacy writers,” assuring them of a hardcover trophy and a state-of-the-art digital edition, and as such part of an overall strategy to overcome resistance among established bestselling authors to publish with the online retail giant. As one senior publishing executive said, 40 to 60 percent of the sales for the Stephen Kings, Lee Childs and John Grishams are still derived from Barnes & Noble, Walmart and Costco. Such authors, he said, “were they to walk away from their traditional publishers, would be leaving a considerable fortune on the table.” But as Amazon’s six other publishing imprints (Montlake Romance, AmazonCrossing, Thomas & Mercer, 47North, Amazon Encore, The Domino Project) have discovered, in certain genres (romance, science fiction and fantasy) formerly relegated to the moribund mass-market paperback, readers care not a whit about cover design or even good writing, and have no attachment at all to the book as object. Like addicts, they just want their fix at the lowest possible price, and Amazon is happy to be their online dealer.","James Marcus, now an editor at Harper’s Magazine, sees a particular irony in Amazon’s entry into book publishing. “When I first worked at Amazon in the mid 1990s,” he recalls, “we were advised to think of publishers as our partners. I believe this directive was in earnest. But even then, a creeping contempt for the publishing industry was sometimes discernible. Weren’t they stodgy traditionalists, who relied on rotary phones and a Depression-era business model? Well, the company is now a bona-fide trade publisher. There’s no predicting how these books will fare, especially with many retailers refusing to sell them (an embargo that won’t, of course, affect e-book sales, where Amazon still rules the roost). But Bezos may now discover that cutting out the middleman isn’t all it’s cracked up to be—that it’s surprisingly easy to fail in the neo-Victorian enterprise of publishing, especially when it comes to finding readers for worthy books. Perhaps it’s time for him to acquire a rotary phone, available in five retro colors and eligible for two-day Prime shipping on his very own site.”","* * *","Amazon’s entry into publishing’s traditional casino is a sideshow. More worrisome, at least over the long term, is the success of Amazon’s Kindle Single program, an effort to encourage writers to make an end run around publishers, not only of books but of magazines as well. That program offers writers a chance to publish original e-book essays of no more than 30,000 words (authors agree to a bargain-basement price of no more than $2.99 in exchange for a 70 percent royalty and no advance). It has attracted Nelson DeMille, Jon Krakauer, William Vollmann, Walter Mosley, Ann Patchett, Amy Tan and the late Christopher Hitchens as well as a slew of lesser-known scribblers, some of whom have enjoyed paydays rivaling or exceeding what they might have gotten were magazines like Vanity Fair or The New Yorker to have commissioned their work. Royalties are direct-deposited monthly, and authors can check their sales anytime—a level of efficiency and transparency almost unknown at traditional publishers and magazines.","The boundaries are blurring all over publishing, as various actors have belatedly roused themselves to the necessities and blandishments of the online world. The literary agency William Morris Endeavor, for example, has launched 212 Books, an e-publishing program designed to showcase its clients, such as the estimable David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, whose first novel is wittingly called Patriots (first-serial rights have been placed with the Huffington Post). Endeavor is also bringing out as a direct e-book the hapless James Frey’s The Final Testament of the Holy Bible. J.K. Rowling, an empire unto herself, is releasing the Harry Potter series on her own terms and making it available through her own website, Amazon, Apple and every other conceivable digital “platform” in the known universe. Sourcebooks Inc., a medium-sized independent publisher based in Naperville, Illinois, is starting an online bookstore to sell its romance novels directly to readers for a monthly fee. Other creative online inducements for writers are being hatched at a number of publishers, including Little, Brown.","* * *","Such efforts have scant chance of preventing Amazon from bulldozing any real or perceived obstacles to its single-minded pursuit of maximum clout. It is big enough to impose increasingly harsh terms on both its competitors and its clients. As reported by the Seattle Times, it has even begun to compel tiny indie publishers to abandon their traditional short discounts and embrace punitive larger trade discounts. When Karen Christensen of Berkshire Publishing Group refused, Amazon “stopped placing orders, affecting 10 percent of her business.”","The Independent Publishers Group, a principal distributor of about 500 small publishers, recently angered Amazon by refusing to accept the company’s peremptory demand for deeper discounts. Amazon promptly yanked nearly 5,000 digital titles. Small-press publishers were beside themselves. Bryce Milligan of Wings Press, based in Texas, spoke for most when, in a blistering broadside, he lambasted Amazon, complaining that its actions caused his sales to drop by 40 percent. “Amazon,” he wrote, “seemingly wants to kill off the distributors, then kill off the independent publishers and bookstores, and become the only link between the reader and the author…. E-book sales have been a highly addictive drug to many smaller publishers. For one thing, there are no ‘returns.’… E-book sales allowed smaller presses to get a taste of the kind of money that online impulse buying can produce. Already e-book sales were underwriting the publication of paper books-and-ink at Wings Press…. For Amazon to rip e-book sales away is a classic bait-and-switch tactic guaranteed to kill small presses by the hundreds…. There was a time not so long ago when ‘competition’ was a healthy thing, not a synonym for corporate ‘murder.’ Amazon could have been a bright and shining star, lighting the way to increased literacy and improved access to alternative literatures. Alas, it looks more likely to be a large and deadly asteroid. We, the literary dinosaurs, are watching to see if this is a near miss or the beginning of extinction.”","But Amazon isn’t the only player willing to play hardball. Random House, for example, quietly began in March to charge public libraries three times the retail price for e-books, causing Nova Scotia’s South Shore Public Libraries to call for a boycott and accuse the German-owned conglomerate of unfair e-book pricing. It gets worse: according to the New York Times, “five of the six major publishers either refuse to make new e-books available to libraries or have pulled back significantly over the last year on how easily or how often those books can be circulated.”","Jacob Stevens, the managing director of Verso, the distinguished independent press spawned by the London-based New Left Review, says of Amazon: “Having our backlist instantly and immediately available has so far outweighed the problems. For me, the problems become worse as Amazon moves from ‘just’ being a big player in selling books to vertical control of entire sections of the industry. It all gets a bit Big Brother. It’s easy to imagine Amazon muscling existing publishers out of the picture altogether and inviting authors and agents to deal directly with them. What would that do for the richness and diversity of our culture?”","And yet Amazon gives $1 million a year, in grants of about $25,000 apiece, to a wide range of independent literary journals and nonprofit organizations, including the Kenyon Review, the newly launched online Los Angeles Review of Books and even One Story, the nonprofit literary magazine devoted to the short story, which recently celebrated its tenth anniversary by honoring Ann Patchett, an outspoken critic of Bezos’ business practices and a co-owner of an independent bookstore in Nashville. Amazon’s contributions outstrip by a large factor any advertising dollars sent my way by traditional publishers during the nearly nine years I ran the Los Angeles Times Book Review. Of course, such largesse—less than a pittance of its $5 billion cash reserve—may be meant to ensnare its most articulate critics in a web of dependency. If so, Amazon will likely be surprised, as the editors of such journals have well-deserved reputations for biting the hand that feeds, and they prize their contrarian sensibilities.","Another bookselling veteran made uneasy by Amazon’s colossal success is Andy Ross, who—having succeeded the venerable Fred Cody as the owner of Cody’s Books in Berkeley until online competition forced its flagship location to close in 2006, after fifty years in business—now works in Oakland as a literary agent. “Monopolies are always problematic in a free society, and they are more so when we are dealing with the dissemination of ideas, which is what book publishing is about,” he told me. “In the realm of electronic publishing, Amazon until recently controlled about 90 percent of the market, a monopoly by almost anyone’s definition. Most people bought their e-books in the proprietary Kindle file format that could only be purchased from Amazon and only read on the Kindle reader that was manufactured by Amazon. Other makers of e-book readers designed them to accept the open-source e-pub format that allowed customers to have a wider choice of retailers to supply them with e-books. Since then, Amazon’s market share has been declining, but 60 percent of all e-books in America continue to be sold by Amazon in the Kindle file format. Amazon simply has too much power in the marketplace. And when their business interest conflicts with the public interest, the public interest suffers.”","It’s a fair point—one that also plagues Peter Mayer of Overlook Press: “All sides of this argument need to think deeply—not just about their businesses, but also about their world. I grew up in a world in which many parts together formed a community adversarial in a microcosmic way but communal in a larger sense: authors, editors, agents, publishers, wholesalers, retailers and readers. I hope, worried as I am about the current trajectory [of publishing], that we do not look back one day, sitting on a stump as the boy does in Shel Silverstein’s The Giving Tree, and only see what has become a largely denuded wasteland.”Also in This Issue\n“How Germany Keeps Amazon at Bay and Literary Culture Alive,” by Michael Naumann\n“Search Gets Lost,” by Anthony Grafton","Steve WassermanSteve Wasserman, publisher and executive director of Heyday Books, based in Berkeley, California, is a consulting editor to Yale University Press.

Facebook played a prominent role in the creation of the OCP, which is holding its annual summit in San Jose on Tuesday.","The new architecture was developed so Facebook could expand some of its current data center complexes, said Omar Baldonado, director of software engineering for infra at Facebook. Like the cloud vendors, Facebook operates data centers in several areas around the world, with each separate location referred to as a “region.” Then within each region, Facebook’s complexes generally have a couple of buildings that house its servers.","An example of how Facebook’s Fabric Aggregation Layer networking technology, which is being donated to the Open Compute Project, might look inside a data center. (Facebook Photo)","Over the past year or so, the company identified the need to expand its footprint within some of those locations to accommodate as many as six buildings. But big powerful switches, which made sense when trying to connect two buildings, start to become expensive and unwieldy when trying to connect a larger number of buildings within a region, he said.","So Facebook took the custom switch it designed a few years ago — the Wedge100 — and designed a new networking architecture that relied on lots of smaller switches like the Wedge100 and a more sophisticated cabling strategy to link multiple buildings in a data center region. This also improves the connection between those data centers and the end user, he said.","When the internet was first getting off the ground back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, data center operators quickly realized they could get better performance and scale capacity much more quickly by stringing together networks of relatively cheap servers, instead of buying one huge expensive machine from the likes of IBM or Sun Microsystems. The Fabric Aggregation Layer is more or less the same idea; network administrators can add less-expensive switches to a rack of networking equipment as needed without having to make a big bet on expensive equipment to handle expected future demand.","The architecture has other benefits: “we’re actually being much more power efficient in terms of the actual designs,” Baldonado said. Power is a huge consideration among massive data center operators, and it takes a lot of power to run the big networking switches that Facebook used to use for connecting its buildings.","“It’s requiring more and more power to keep the signal integrity with that amount of data” using big switches, Baldonado said. “We can do it, but at what cost? Any power spent for the network is power not spent for the servers doing compute,” he said.","Facebook has been using the Fabric Aggregation Layer for production workloads within some of its data centers, and eventually all of its infrastructure will shift over to this method.","Sponsor Post","We pioneered the global shift to cloud, social, mobile, and data science technologies, and we’ve been disrupting enterprise software ever since.

Obviously, that's a country which is rife with political discord and opportunities for destabilisation,\" said Labour MP Paul Farrelly, member of the parliamentary committee, during his questioning.","\"They (Cambridge Analytica) worked extensively in India. They have an office in India,\" Wylie responded.\n\"I believe their client was Congress, but I know that they have done all kinds of projects. I don't remember a national project but I know regionally. India's so big that one state can be as big as Britain. But they do have offices there, they do have staff there,\" the 28-year-old added, on being probed further.","He offered to provide the committee \"documentation\" on India, which was welcomed by Farrelly, who said India was a country that did not need any added \"tensions\".","However, it wasn't clear at the time whether Wylie meant that Congress was Cambridge Analytica's only client in India or if other parties and individuals have also employed the controversial data-mining firm.","During his evidence, Wylie also said that his predecessor, Dan Muresan, Head of Elections at SCL Group, had also been working in India before he died in Kenya under mysterious circumstances. He claimed to have heard stories that Muresan, a Romanian national, may have been poisoned in a hotel room while in the African country.","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, co-founder of PersonalData.IO, a service that helps individuals regain control over their personal data, also giving evidence to the committee, added that he had heard reports that Muresan was being paid by an Indian billionaire who wanted Congress to lose elections.\n\"So he was pretending to work for one party but actually paid underhand by someone else,\" said Dehaye. He added that it would be for Indian and Kenyan journalists to get together to investigate the matter further.","Wylie has accused his former employer, Cambridge Analytica, of gathering the details of 50 million users on Facebook through a personality quiz in 2014.

The Congress and Rahul Gandhi must apologise to the nation,\" Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters on Tuesday night.","This vindicates what the BJP had been been saying from day one, he said.","\"Cambridge Analytica is in the dock for data theft and trying to manipulate voters using unlawful means.

The social network maintains that Cambridge Analytica violated Facebook’s rules, but all of that collected personal data did not come from a hack.","How Cambridge Analytica got the Facebook data","Until the middle of 2014, Facebook allowed apps to abuse a loophole to collect personal data on a user’s entire friend network. In this case, an app not only harvested data from the person using the personality quiz app called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" created by U.K. academic Aleksandr Kogan, but also delved into that person’s friends network and harvested all of their Facebook profile data, as well. Facebook claimed only 270,000 people downloaded that app, but Kogan managed to obtain data from 50 million accounts without their consent. Of those, enough data had been harvested from 30 million for Cambridge Analytica to create psychographic profiles on them.","Facebook removed Kogan’s “research” app in 2015 and demanded users’ collected data to be destroyed. Yet several sources have confirmed that the data was not destroyed in 2015.","Sources close to Cambridge Analytica told Wired that the data allegedly deleted in 2015 was still accessible in 2017. The internal Cambridge Analytica database, called “Kogan-import,” had “included Facebook IDs, and responses to personality surveys that had been administered by Kogan in 2015.” This database “was only visible to a small number of staffers in data science, engineering, and IT. The source says the database was tightly controlled in terms of who could edit or delete it.”","On Saturday, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) called on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the Senate about the “Facebook breach.”","Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say “trust us.” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.","The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.","In a series of rapid-fire and later-deleted tweets made on Saturday, Facebook CSO Alex Stamos took exception to the “breach” terminology. Stamos then said he deleted them “not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.”","Cambridge Analytica responds","Cambridge Analytica put out its own statement after Facebook’s announcement, claiming it deleted all the data obtained by Global Science Research, which had been contracted in 2014, after learning the data had be obtained outside of Facebook’s terms of service. The firm added, “No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","Whistleblower Chritopher Wylie tells his story","Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica, can help you fully understand the scope of what happened and how it “exploited” Facebook.","Wylie is sorry for the role he played in the “full service propaganda machine.” He added that “it was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country. The psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.”","How many times will people accept Facebook’s version of truth — that “protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook”? Over and over throughout the years, despite carefully worded statements after some privacy fiasco, Facebook has proven that users’ privacy is not at the heart of the company. Making money via collecting data about users to sell ads is.","Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.) added, “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

The app developer breached Facebook's terms of service by giving the data to Cambridge Analytica.[24]","On 1 May 2018, Cambridge Analytica and its parent company filed for insolvency proceedings and closed operations.[25][26] Alexander Taylor, a former director for Cambridge Analytica, was appointed director of Emerdata on 28 March 2018.[27]","Cambridge Analytica (SCL USA) was incorporated in January 2015 with its registered office in Westferry Circus, London and just one staff member, its director and CEO Alexander James Ashburner Nix (also appointed in January 2015).[28] Nix is also the director of nine similar companies sharing the same registered offices in London, including Firecrest technologies, Emerdata and six SCL Group companies including \"SCL elections limited\".[29]Nigel Oakes founded SCL Group, which is the parent company of Cambridge Analytica.[30]","Publicly, SCL Group called itself a \"global election management agency\",[31]Politico reported it was known for involvement \"in military disinformation campaigns to social media branding and voter targeting\".[8] SCL's involvement in the political world has been primarily in the developing world where it has been used by the military and politicians to study and manipulate public opinion and political will. Slate writer Sharon Weinberger compared one of SCL's hypothetical test scenarios to fomenting a coup.[8]","Cambridge Analytica was founded by conservative businessmen Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer. A minimum of 15 million dollars has been invested into the company by Mercer, according to The New York Times.[32] Bannon's stake in the company was estimated at 1 to 5 million dollars, but he divested his holdings in April 2017 as required by his role as White House Chief Strategist.[33] In March 2018, Jennifer Mercer and Rebekah Anne Mercer became directors of Emerdata limited.[34]\nIn March 2018 it became public by WhistleblowerChristopher Wylie, that Cambridge Analytica's first activities where founded on a data set, which its parent company SCL bought 2014 from a company named Global Science Research founded by Aleksandr Kogan[35] who worked as an psychologist at Cambridge.","Per the Associated Press, Data Propria, a data analysis firm launched May 2018, is run by former officials at Cambridge Analytica.[36][37][38]","CA's data analysis methods were to a large degree based on the academic work of Michal Kosinski. In 2008, Kosinski had joined the Psychometrics Centre of Cambridge University where he then developed with his colleagues a profiling system using general online data, Facebook-likes, and smartphone data.[45][46] He showed that with a limited number of \"likes\", people can be analysed better than friends or relatives can do and that individual psychological targeting is a powerful tool to influence people.[45]","CA would collect data on voters using sources such as demographics, consumer behaviour, internet activity, and other public and private sources. According to The Guardian, CA used psychological data derived from millions of Facebook users, largely without users' permission or knowledge.[47] Another source of information was the \"Cruz Crew\" mobile app that tracked physical movements and contacts and according to the Associated Press, invaded personal data more than previous presidential campaign apps.[48]","\"Today in the United States we have somewhere close to four or five thousand data points on every individual ... So we model the personality of every adult across the United States, some 230 million people.\"","The company claimed to use \"data enhancement and audience segmentation techniques\" providing \"psychographic analysis\" for a \"deeper knowledge of the target audience\". The company uses the Big Five model of personality [10][9] Using what it calls \"behavioralmicrotargeting\" the company indicates that it can predict \"needs\" of subjects and how these needs may change over time. Services then can be individually targeted for the benefit of its clients from the political arena, governments, and companies providing \"a better and more actionable view of their key audiences.\" According to Sasha Issenberg, CA indicates that it can tell things about an individual he might not even know about himself.[7][49]","CA derived much of its personality data on online surveys which it conducts on an ongoing basis. For each political client, the firm would narrow voter segments from 32 different personality styles it attributes to every adult in the United States. The personality data would inform the tone of the language used in ad messages or voter contact scripts, while additional data is used to determine voters' stances on particular issues.[50]","The data would get updated with monthly surveys, asking about political preferences and how people get the information they use to make decisions. It also covered consumer topics about different brands and preferred products, building up an image of how someone shops as much as how they vote.[51]","Channel 4 News, a news programme broadcast by the British public serviceChannel 4, conducted a four-month investigation into Cambridge Analytica starting in November 2017. An undercover reporter posed as a potential customer for Cambridge Analytica, hoping to help Sri Lankan candidates get elected. Video footage from this operation was published on 19 March 2018.[52] From the footage, Cambridge Analytica executives say they worked on over 200 elections across the world.[53] Alexander Nix was recorded in this investigation, talking \"unguardedly about the company's practices\".[54] Nix said that his company uses honey traps, bribery stings, and prostitutes, for opposition research.[55] For example, Nix offered to discredit political opponents in Sri Lanka with suggestive videos using \"beautiful Ukrainian girls\" and offers of bribes, even if the opponents did not accept the offers.[56] Cambridge Analytica said that the video footage was \"edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent\" the recorded conversations and company's business practices. Nix said that he had \"entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios\", but insisted his company does not engage in entrapment or bribery.[57]","In the third part of the series, Nix also said that Cambridge Analytica \"ran all the digital campaign\" for Trump. Nix stated they used communications that would be self-destructive, leaving no incriminating evidence. After the news segment was broadcast, the board of Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix as chief executive officer. The company also released a statement that the allegations did not represent the ethics of the company, and an independent entity would investigate Nix's statements.[58]","The investigation also raised questions regarding campaign finance law. During the 2016 election, the company was employed both by Trump's campaign and Robert Mercer's Make America Number 1 Super PAC which supported Trump. While PACs are not limited in the amount of funds they can spend on behalf of a candidate, they are not allowed to coordinate strategy with the campaigns they are supporting. Nix's statements in the recorded video describe how the Trump campaign itself could \"take the high road\" and \"stay clean\", while the negative attacks were handled by the firm and the Super PAC, in a way which makes it \"unattributable, untrackable\". These statements potentially suggested unlawful coordination between Trump's campaign and the PAC, although Cambridge Analytica has denied this.[59]","Canadian whistleblower Christopher Wylie who was the former director of research at Cambridge Analytica","Political scientists have been highly skeptical of claims made by Cambridge Analytica about the effectiveness of its microtargeting of voters (microtargeting refers to the process of \"analyzing data to predict the behavior, interests, and opinions held by specific groups of people and then serving them the messages they're most likely to respond to\").[60][15][16] Political scientists note that access to digital data is not going to provide significantly more information than from public voter databases, and the digital data has limited value over time as the preferences of voters change.[15] Political scientists also note that it is hard to infer political values from personality traits, which means that it is easy to mistarget the messages that are sent to voters with specific personality traits.[15] Research discussed by Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College showed that it is extremely hard to alter voters' preferences, because many likely voters are already committed partisans; as a result, it is easier to simply mobilize partisan voters.[61][15] Tufts University political scientist Eitan Hersh, who has published on microtargeting in campaigns, has expressed strong skepticism about Cambridge Analytica's methods and their purported effectiveness, saying \"Every claim about psychographics etc made by or about [Cambridge Analytica] is BS.\"[62]","In 2017, CA claimed that it has psychological profiles of 220 million US citizens based on 5,000 separate data sets.[63] In March 2017, The New York Times reported that CA had exaggerated its capabilities: \"Cambridge executives now concede that the company never used psychographics in the Trump campaign.\"[12] Trump aides have also disputed CA's role in the campaign, describing it as \"modest\" and noting that none of the company's efforts involved psychographics.[12]","According to an aide and consultant for Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, their campaign stopped using CA after its psychographic models failed to identify likely Cruz supporters. The Cruz campaign ceased access to all of Cambridge's data after the South Carolina Republican primary on 20 February 2016 when Cruz came in third after Trump and Rubio.[12][64]","The use of personal data collected without knowledge or permission to establish sophisticated models of user's personalities raises ethical and privacy issues.[47] CA operated out of the United States; its operations would be illegal in Europe with its stricter privacy laws.[48] While Cruz was outspoken about protecting personal information from the government, his database of CA has been described as \"political-voter surveillance\".[48]","Regarding CA's use of Facebook users, a speaker for CA indicated that these users gave permission when signing up with the provider, while Facebook declared that \"misleading people or misusing information\" is in violation of Facebook's policies.[47] In 2015, Facebook indicated that it was investigating the matter.[47] In March 2018, Facebook announced that it had suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories for failing to delete data on Facebook users that had been improperly collected.[65]","Alexander Nix suggested that data collection and microtargeting benefits the voters – because they receive messages about issues they care about. However, digital rights protection groups raised concerns that private information is collected, stored, and shared while individuals are \"left in the dark about [it]\" and have no control.[66]","Significant backlash against Facebook came to light in March 2018, resulting in controversy as well as a $37 billion drop in the market capitalization of Facebook, as of 20 March.[67] Due to the scandal of enabling monetization of Facebook personal data, one assessment was that only 41% of Facebook users trust the company.[68] On 26 March, the US Federal Trade Commission announced it is \"conducting an open investigation of Facebook Inc's privacy practices following the disclosure that 50 million users' data got into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.\"[69]","CA ran campaigns in secret during Kenya's 2013 and 2017 elections.[77] In 2018, a CA employee said that his predecessor at the company had been found dead in his hotel room in Kenya while working on Uhuru Kenyatta's 2013 campaign.[78] The company claimed on its website to have conducted a survey of 47,000 Kenyans during the 2013 elections in order to understand \"key national and local political issues, levels of trust in key politicians, voting behaviours/intentions, and preferred information channels\". According to verified sources, CA worked with 360 Media a company formed by Simon Gicharu founder of Mount Kenya University and Tom Mshindi Editor in Chief of Nation Media Group. Gicharu’s 360 developing online campaigns in the 2017 Kenyan elections portraying “Raila Odinga as a blood-thirsty individual who is also sympathetic to Al-Shabaab and having no development agenda,” whilst portraying the incumbent President Kenyatta as “tough on terrorism, and being good for the economy.”[79]\nAfter the revelations in March 2018, where CA staff boasted of their power in Kenya, opposition figures called for an investigation. Norman Magaya, an official of the National Super Alliance, accused CA and the ruling Jubilee Party of committing a crime and called for an investigation.[80] The ruling Jubilee Party downplayed CA's role, saying it had hired the firm's parent company, to assist with branding.[81]","In its Disinformation and ‘fake news’ inquiry, published on 29 July, 2018, the UK Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee noted that it is believed that CA, or its associated companies, worked with the Labour Party in Malta, on the 2013 general election campaign.[82] Several sources including assassinated journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia additionally linked this operation by CA to close collaboration with Henley & Partners who, following a well-established pattern, would immediately after the election introduce and run a lucrative Citizenship by Investment Scheme in Malta.[83][84] The Maltese Government issued a press release denying the claims and calling the report and its sources \"fake news\".[85]","After the Facebook scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, Forbes published that the British news program Channel 4 News had mentioned the existence of proof revealing ties between the PRI and Cambridge Analytica, suggesting a modus operandi similar to the one in the United States. According to Channel 4 News' Guillermo Galdos, CA worked for the PRI at least until January 2018.[86][87][88] An investigation was requested.[89]","In 2017 the company had reached out to PRI, Mexico's ruling political party, in order to bolster the party's presidential campaign during the largest-ever political elections of 2018. The party decided that it was sufficiently equipped to mess with the election on its own, but still paid Cambridge Analytica to prevent it from working with rival parties.[90]","No campaign contributions, in cash or in kind, by Cambridge Analytica were reported to the UK electoral authorities. Both CA and Leave.eu refused to comment on any donation of services.[96] On 23 March 2018, it was reported that a former employee, Brittany Kaiser, who was the company's former director of business development, has revealed that the company misled the public and MPs over its links with Leave.EU and the analysis of data which had been provided by UKIP. She said she felt she had lied by supporting Cambridge Analytica's company line that it had done \"no paid or unpaid work\" for Leave.EU. \"In my opinion, I was lying. In my opinion I felt like we should say, 'this is exactly what we did'\".[97] The following day, it was reported that the company claimed that it would be able to affect the outcome of the Referendum, and that it had produced a 10-page document headed \"Big Data Solutions for the EU Referendum\", claiming it could single out 'Brexiteers' among voters, donors, politicians and journalists.[98]","DW reported in March 2018 that \"Whistleblower Christopher Wylie told UK lawmakers during a committee hearing on Tuesday that a firm linked to Cambridge Analytica helped the official Vote Leave campaign [the official pro-Brexit group headed by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove] circumvent campaign financing laws during the Brexit referendum.\"[99]","The company worked with the John Bolton Super PAC on a major digital and TV campaign focused on senate races in Arkansas, North Carolina and New Hampshire and helped turn out voters for the Republican candidates in those states. Two of the Republican candidates backed by the Bolton Super PAC, Thom Tillis in North Carolina and Tom Cotton in Arkansas, won their Senate bids, while Scott Brown lost in New Hampshire. The PAC ran 15 different spots each in North Carolina and Arkansas and 17 in New Hampshire, mostly online with some targeted directly to households using Dish and DirecTV. All were intended to push Bolton's national security agenda.[103]","CA also supported Thom Tillis's successful campaign to oust Kay Hagan as a senator for North Carolina. The firm was credited for its role in identifying a sizeable cluster of North Carolinians who prioritised foreign affairs, which encouraged Tillis to shift the conversation from state-level debates over education policy to charges that incumbent Kay Hagan had failed to take ISIS's rise seriously.[104] Tillis's campaign and the North Carolina Republican Party paid Cambridge Analytica $345,000 for these services.[105]","Ted Cruz became an early major client of CA in the 2016 presidential campaign. Just prior to the Iowa caucuses, the Cruz campaign had spent $3 million for CA's services,[108] with additional money coming from allied Super-PACs.[108] After Cruz's win at the Iowa caucus CA was credited with having been able to identify and motivate potential voters.[109][110] Ultimately the Cruz campaign spent $5.8 million on work by CA.[111]","After Cruz dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination in May 2016, Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer started to support Trump.[114] In August, it became known that CA followed their allegiance and worked for Trump's presidential campaign.[111][114] Trump's campaign also worked with digital firm Giles Parscale.[111] In September, the Trump campaign spent $5 million to purchase television advertising.[115] The Trump campaign spent less than $1 million in data work.[116][not in citation given]","In 2016, the company said that it had not used psychographics in the Trump presidential campaign.[117] Cambridge Analytica targeted potential voters with bespoke messages. Cambridge Analytica's data head, Alexander Tayler said, \"When you think about the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3m votes but won the electoral college vote, [t]hat's down to the data and the research.\"[118]","On 4 August 2017, Michael Flynn, who is under investigation by US counterintelligence for his contacts with Russian officials, amended a public financial filing to reflect that he had served in an advisory role in an agreement with CA during the 2016 Trump campaign.[124]","On 8 October 2017, Brad Parscale, who was the digital media director for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, stated in an interview with Lesley Stahl from CBS News on 60 Minutes that Parscale was able to utilize Facebook advertising to directly target individual voters in swing states.[125] Parscale cited the example in which he was able to target specific universes (audiences) who care about infrastructure and promote Trump and his message to build back up the crumbling American infrastructure.[126] Although he hired Cambridge Analytica to assist with microtargeting, and Cambridge Analytica stated that it was the key to Trump's victory, Parscale denied that he gained assistance from the firm, stating that he thought Cambridge Analytica's use of psychographics doesn't work.[127] He also denied any assistance with links to Russia.[127] According to Parscale, the Clinton Campaign turned down assistance from these platforms.[127]","On 25 October 2017, Julian Assange said that on Twitter that he had been approached by Cambridge Analytica, but said he had rejected its proposal.[128] Assange's tweet followed a story in The Daily Beast[129] alleging that Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had proposed a collaboration with Wikileaks to find the 33,000 emails that had been deleted from Clinton's private server. CNN said it had been told by several unnamed sources[130] that Nix intended to turn the Clinton email archive released to the public by the State Department into a searchable database for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee.","In 2018, following disclosures that the company had inappropriately acquired the personal information of over 50 million Facebook users while working on Trump's presidential campaign, the Times of Israel reported that the company had used what Nix had called \"intelligence gathering\" from British and Israeli companies as part of their efforts to influence the election results in Trump's favor.[132]","^Dwoskin, Elizabeth (16 March 2018). \"Facebook bans Trump campaign's data analytics firm for taking user data\".

The explosion in traffic occurred in the wake of Trump's controversial proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.","The 50 million interactions from 14 million unique users represent Trump's highest total for any week of the year. Trump tallied 41.6 million interactions on Facebook the first week of September; the highest total of any of his competitors was the 28.3 million interactions Hillary Clinton racked up when she announced her campaign in April. Clinton tallied 9.4 million interactions the week before Christmas; Bernie Sanders got 6.5 million.","The total interactions for the first three weeks of December demonstrate just how much of the conversation Trump consumes: Trump, 98.9 million; Clinton 22.9 million; Sanders 14.5 million; Ted Cruz, 13.7 million; Ben Carson, 6.7 million. Nobody else was over 5 million.","Trump's dominance of the on-line discussion is not new, but it is getting bigger. Of the 20 most active weeks on Facebook among all the presidential candidates in 2015, Trump accounts for 17 of them, the other three belonging to Clinton.","It is also worth noting that there were 25 instances this year of a single candidate being discussed by more than 5 million unique Facebook users in a week. Three of those instances were Hillary Clinton; one was Bernie Sanders; the rest were all Trump. Trump has topped 10 million unique users talking about him three times. No other candidate hit that milestone in 2015.","It is worth noting that this data makes no attempt to part the sentiment of the comments being posted; a significant share of the conversation about Trump (and the rest of the candidates) is probably negative."],"isopubdate":""}

The social media giant agreed to the FTC order to settle the agency’s complaint in 2011 that Facebook’s privacy practices were deceptive, complex, and hard to navigate.","The FTC is now investigating Facebook’s compliance with that 2012 order, in a probe the agency revived after March 17 reports by The New York Times and The Observer of London, that political data firm Cambridge Analytica had gained access through an outside app to 50 million Facebook profiles by or before 2015. Cambridge Analytica used the personal data to develop psychological profiles of individual Facebook members that could be used to micro-target election-related messages to people most likely to be receptive to them, the Observer reported.","The FTC investigation, which could lead to substantial fines, is one of the most significant legal challenges Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) now confronts, as it also deals with Congressional demands for testimony from CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the potential for stricter regulation, lawsuits from users and shareholders, the #deleteFacebook movement, and sinking share prices that have lopped more than $90 billion from its market capitalization, as of Wednesday.","Those concerns aren’t confined to this side of the ocean. Jeopardy also looms from powerful regulatory bodies in Europe, where privacy laws are significantly stronger than they are in the United States. So strong, in fact, that violations of an E.U. person’s individual privacy can be punished with fines of as much as 4 percent of a company’s global annual revenue. Enforcement of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is set to begin May 25, and big tech companies handling international data sets of personal information were always in the gunsights of the E.U. regulators.","Their scrutiny of Facebook is likely to be even more intense after the wave of news reports that connect the global social media giant to Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly transformed the targeted messaging techniques widely used by Facebook advertisers into a means for influencing voter opinion in the U.S. presidential election in 2016. While Facebook maintains that its 50 million profiles were shared with Cambridge Analytica through a policy violation by an outside app, and not a security breach, the data loss still places Facebook in the E.U. hotseat, says Greg Sparrow, a data and security policy expert.","“They’ve really put themselves in the center of the bullseye,” says Sparrow, general manager at Duluth, GA-based CompliancePoint, which helps businesses comply with U.S. privacy laws as well as the GDPR.","To gauge Facebook’s vulnerability under E.U. regulations, Sparrow says, one key question has yet to be answered: Did any of the 50 million profiles obtained by Cambridge Analytica belong to E.U. residents? (The GDPR does not protect U.S. citizens.)","Sparrow says he wouldn’t be surprised if profiles of E.U. individuals had been scooped up by Cambridge Analytica, or by other companies taking advantage of the Facebook privacy controls existing in 2013, which created broad openings for outside apps to harvest the profiles not only of the app’s users, but also all of their friends’. Facebook has acknowledged that a number of other companies may have amassed such data troves and misused them, and says it is trying to track them down. But Facebook hasn’t said whether Europeans’ profiles were collected.","The United Kingdom Information Commissioner’s Office conducted a seven-hour search of Cambridge Analytica’s offices starting on the evening of March 23, and is now analyzing evidence collected under a search warrant.","In March of 2017, the U.K. office started looking into the data privacy risks raised by the use of data analytics, and in May it launched a formal investigation of the use of these tools for political purposes.","“This will involve deepening our current activity to explore practices deployed during the U.K.’s EU Referendum campaign (the “Brexit” vote) but potentially also in other campaigns,” information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a written statement. “Given the transnational nature of data the investigation will involve exploring how companies operating internationally deploy such practices with impact or handling of data in the U.K.”","The U.K. agency is looking into the process by which Facebook data came into the hands of researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who collaborated with Cambridge Analytica to use a personality quiz app to induce Facebook users, perhaps unwittingly, to permit the app to access their own data as well as their friends’ profiles, the Observer reported.","Denham said the U.K. will cooperate with other countries in the probe.","While the U.K. commission is ferreting through Cambridge Analytica’s files, the FTC will be examining Facebook’s privacy practices in the years following the FTC’s 2012 order. Those related investigations, as well as the parallel press scrutiny, may inevitably spill over into the U.S. examination of Russian involvement in the presidential election of 2016, in which Cambridge Analytica reportedly assisted candidate Donald Trump.","Facebook was credited with providing aid to special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian election interference when the Department of Justice last month announced the indictment of 13 Russians and three companies for allegedly conspiring to thwart federal election laws and other federal statutes by spreading false and divisive messages through social media channels. (Federal law forbids foreign nationals from influencing U.S. elections.) Facebook revealed in September that it had traced 3,000 ads, bought from Facebook for $100,000, to hundreds of fake accounts it concluded were probably operated from Russia. But The New York Times reported last week that those disclosures had been delayed by an internal debate among Facebook leaders on how much they should reveal about Russians’ misuse of the social media network.","Along with the Cambridge Analytica revelations, facts are now surfacing that … Next Page »"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

I was told that what I saw with my own eyes hadn’t happened.","When I would confront my mother with things that she had said, or things that she had done, she would say I was making it up, that it was a lie. When I confronted her with facts, they were batted away. So it wasn’t just that my reality was canceled, but that my perception of reality was overwritten.","As I wrote in my memoir, An Abbreviated Life, it wasn’t the loudest and scariest explosions that caused the most damage. It wasn’t the physical violence or the verbal abuse or the lack of boundaries and inappropriate behavior. What did the real damage was the denial that these incidents ever occurred.","The erasure of the abuse was worse than the abuse.","When I was in my mid-30s, I had an encounter with someone who recognized me from when I was a child. “Are you so-and-so’s daughter?” he asked. I nodded. He had been a guest at one of my mother’s parties. After I left, he said: “I had always wondered how that little girl would survive. I had thought her only choices were suicide or murder.”","When I was told he said this, I felt validation. And that line stayed with me for many reasons. This outsider observed what I was living through, and having him as a witness confirmed what I knew.","One of the most insidious things about gaslighting is the denial of reality. Being denied what you have seen. Being denied what you have experienced and know to be true. It can make you feel like you are crazy. But you are not crazy.","Dr Robin Stern, associate director at Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and author of The Gaslight Effect says that usually “when people are abused there are signs that you can point to that are much more obvious. Someone who has been hit or threatened for instance – it’s easy to see and understand how they have been hurt. But when someone is manipulating you, you end up second-guessing yourself and turning your attention to yourself as the person to blame”.","To illustrate this, she cites an example that is easy to understand. A close friend of hers was always running late. Initially, she pointed this out to him noting that it was not respectful. His response was to tell her she was “too sensitive”. But over time, when this dynamic would continue to happen, it would lead to arguing and when she persisted he would say, “You really have a problem with time, don’t you?” and she in turn, ended up thinking he might be right. She began to doubt herself. “I began to think – what’s the problem if someone is late, maybe I’m not being flexible enough.’”","This is what she calls the gaslight effect. “Gaslighting over time leads to somebody experiencing the gaslight effect. Someone can try to gaslight you, but it can’t happen unless you allow it.”","This is the tricky part. Because when there is someone in a position of power or authority, someone you idealize, or even as in many co-dependent relationships – when there is someone you are afraid to lose – their insistence that their reality is the reality can often cause you to doubt what you know to be true.","“We are living in a time where a lot of people are having a tough time deciding what’s real and feeling like they are being manipulated,” Stern says. “If they know something is true and somebody tells you it’s not true, holding on to your reality is essential. You can’t be gaslighted if you stay inside your own reality and recognize the manipulation when you see it.”","Smoke and mirrors: how Trump manipulates the media and opponents","Read more","What’s happening on a national level is activating and retraumatizing a lot of people who have been gaslighted in the past. The crazy-making, mind-bending, massive confusion-inducing effects of our current administration’s recklessness with the truth and disregard for verifiable facts is creating an emotional and psychological whiplash. It’s affecting people who have been subjected to abusive relationships; people who feel emotionally vulnerable and it seems to stoke a nearly unprecedented rage in those of us who can see it and feel powerless to do anything to combat it. When people in the mainstream media are being discredited, how exactly are you supposed to call this out?","There were some strategies – which I didn’t know at the time were strategies – that helped me survive. And in these uncertain times, it is a way to stay sane.","Remain defiant","When I was a little girl about five or six, I wrote a story about running away from home. When my mother saw that story, she demanded I change it. Why would you write this story? It isn’t about me, is it? She knew it was about her and the chaos at home. I refused to change the story and that defiance was key. Trusting my version of reality. Not allowing it to be altered on demand. Resistance. This anger protected me, because I knew what I knew. It couldn’t be erased. Being defiant does not make you difficult. It makes you resilient.","Recognize there will never be accountability","The person who is gaslighting you will never be able to see your point of view or take responsibility for their actions. They will never get it. They will never say, “Oh, you’re right – you have a point.”","Acknowledgement is not on the cards. And asserting yourself is not just useless but harmful. Because the person gaslighting will never be able to respond to logic and reason – and so you have to be the one to recognize that logic and reason can’t be applied.","Let go of the wish for things to be different","The wish for things to be different is very powerful and inoculates you to the tumult. It allows you to continue to believe logic and reason will prevail. You want to believe the person will change. You want things to make sense. But they won’t. You want to feel you are on safe ground. You have to let go of this wish. Because things will never make sense. You will never be heard.","Develop healthy detachment","I had to develop certain coping mechanisms, but there was a price. Behavior that was adaptive as a child becomes maladaptive as an adult: I was not trusting and always needing verification.","I became hyper-vigilant about clarity. There was no room for misunderstanding; no margin for error. I needed certainty in an uncertain world. But we live in an uncertain world, so there has to be a way to find balance.","Detaching from the gaslighting does not mean total detachment. It means distinguishing between the world of the gaslighter and the real world.","“Someone can try to gaslight you and once you can identify what’s going on, you can begin to turn off the gaslighting and heal,” Stern says. She points out that often people are willing to give up their reality in favor of hanging on to a relationship rather than rupturing it.","There are, she says, many different signs to recognize when you’re being gaslighted. “You feel confused and crazy. You’re always apologizing, wondering if you are good enough, can’t understand why you feel so bad all the time, or know something is wrong but can’t put your finger on it. You thought one thing, they say another; you can’t figure out which is right.”","A tip she offers for handling things is to write down what actually happened in the conversation. “Once you are not flooded with emotion, you can reflect rationally. Look at the conversation and see where it took a turn.”","When someone is so certain about what they believe and they keep on insisting and trying to convince you – over a period of time – it erodes your own perception. And having to verify reality is in itself destabilizing.","Stern poses an interesting question. “Are people upset because current leaders are telling them something they know isn’t true, or is it because they are upset other people might be believing it?”","With gaslighting, it feels as though the ground is always shifting beneath you. There is no center of gravity. And while we’re being told up is down and black is white, the only way to make sense of it is to remain resolute. Let people have their alternative facts. You’ll stick to reality."],"isopubdate":"2017-03-16"}

If you’re still keen on using Facebook, though, you might want to access it through Mozilla’s Firefox browser, with the organization’s new extension in tow.","The Facebook Container extension essentially isolates your identity on the social network from other sites that use third-party cookies. That means that if you’ve logged into Facebook and then visited a separate site, the company won’t be able to track your web activity and associate it with your profile.","So, for example, Facebook won’t be able to tell which site you enjoy browsing for news, just because you clicked on a link or opened up the news site in a separate tab; if the site uses cookies and you didn’t have the extension installed, Facebook would be able to build up a profile about you which includes your preference for this news site.","Once you’ve got the extension installed, it’ll first delete all your Facebook cookies in Firefox. The next time you visit the social network’s site, it’ll load in a blue-colored tab (which means you’re browsing in a container) and function as normal – except that if you navigate to a non-Facebook site, that page will load outside of the container.","It’s worth noting that sites which require a Facebook account for registering or logging in may not work properly because of the extension; the same goes for embedded Facebook comments on articles. But if you value the privacy of your data, that’s a small price to pay.","Of course, this isn’t going to stop Facebook from collecting or selling data about you through its site and from other sources where it’s connected to your account – but it’s a great start towards regaining control over your data."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-28"}

Although it attracted 270,000 Facebook users to take part, Facebook's APIs at the time let the app also collect a wide range of information about each authorized user's friends.","Since an average Facebook user has hundreds of friends in his/her friend-list, Kogan was able to leverage his user base of 270,000 people to collect data for about 50 million Facebook users for use in its ad-targeting work.","Stop Third-Party Apps From Using Your Facebook Data","Not only Cambridge Analytica's quiz app, there are other thousands of other apps that you might have encountered on your Facebook timeline—such as \"how you’ll look in your 80s,\" \"which celebrity you look like,\" \"who’ll be your Valentine this year\"—that work on the same model.","All Facebook apps offer access using their Facebook account and ask you to grant the app’s developer a range of information from your Facebook profile, like your name, location, email, and friends list.","Besides this, ‘Login with Facebook’ option that you might have seen on hundreds of thousands of websites works similarly by allowing site admins to offer one-click login/signup for easy to verify your identity.","It would be a good time now to revisit those third-party apps you have granted permission to access your Facebook data and completely revoke them if you don't want them to use your data and limit an app's permissions without entirely revoking it.","To disable such apps from accessing your data, you can follow these steps:","On the desktop computer, click the downward arrow in the top-right corner and select Settings and Apps from the menu. Here you’ll see all the apps where you have logged into Facebook.","On mobile devices, open the menu(bottom-right for iOS, top-right for Android), and then select Settings → Account Settings → Apps → Logged in with Facebook.","For entirely revoking any app, just tap on the remove button (cross icon) next to that app. You can also limit any app's permission by clicking the edit button (pencil icon), next to the cross icon, to view each app’s settings.","From here, you can revoke specific permissions by de-selecting the checkmark next to each data point.","Today in an interview with CNN’s Laurie Segall, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg apologized for the social media giant’s failure to prevent privacy of its users.","\"This was a major breach of trust, and I’m really sorry this happened,\" Zuckerberg told Laurie.","While addressing the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Zuckerberg acknowledged that it was a huge mistake to allow third-party developers to access users’ data and blindly trust that Cambridge Analytica and other companies involved in data harvesting would actually delete that data just because Facebook has asked them to.","\"That ... is probably the biggest mistake that we made here,\"","Zuckerberg pledged to solve all the problems and safeguard users’ privacy, explaining how the company has already changed its policies after 2014 to prevent abuse of Facebook's APIs.","\"Our responsibility now is to make sure this doesn’t happen again,\" Zuck assured its customers and shareholders across the world who are furious after knowing about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","During the interview, Zuckerberg promised to conduct a \"full forensic audit\" of the platform very soon to find which 3rd-party apps may have gained access to user data without their full consent and would notify everyone whose data was improperly used.","Mark Zuckerberg Says It's Time to Regulate Tech Firms","Some analysts believe that stricter government regulations are required to protect consumers’ privacy over social media companies.","Since social media is playing an essential role in the world, Zuckerberg says he believes it's time to impose more regulations on technology companies, but he also recommends Artificial Intelligence as a better tool to regulate such a rapidly growing community of 2 billion people all over the world","Besides this, Facebook has also planned to have more than 20,000 employees to closely monitor security and privacy operations by the end of this year.","Facebook Faces International Investigation Over Personal Data Use","Facebook is in trouble with governments across the world after this whole Cambridge Analytica mess.","Following reports of the transfer of personal information of over 50 million users from Facebook to data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica, Facebook is facing probes by some countries including the United States, European Union, UK, Israel, India, and Canada.","The United States’ Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has started investigating whether or not the use of personal data from over 50 million users by Cambridge Analytica violated a consent decree Facebook signed with the agency in 2011.","The European Commission has also asked data protection authorities to investigate Facebook's data leak to Cambridge Analytica, and if the commission finds Facebook in breach of data protection laws, it could levy fines on the company.","The social networking site is also facing a separate probe by the U.K. government, who is pursuing a warrant to conduct its on-site investigation to determine whether Cambridge Analytica still has the information, which the company said has been deleted.","Israeli Justice Ministry has also informed Facebook that it is opening an \"administrative investigation\" into Facebook \"and the possibility of additional violations of Israelis’ personal information,\" the ministry said Thursday.","Cambridge Analytica has suspended its CEO from the research firm’s board of directors on Tuesday following an undercover video was aired which showed him discussing the use of bribes and prostitutes to sway political elections.","The board said that Alexander Nix would be suspended pending a \"full, independent investigation,\" adding that \"In the view of the Board, Mr. Nix’s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations

He blogs about marketing and growth at Threadling and is preparing to launch Dispatches From The Future, a podcast about the future of humanity.","Maybe it’s naive, but I’d always hoped that Facebook would evolve into the Internet’s humanizing, unifying force — the one that would stretch across geographical, national, religious and racial boundaries to show us that, even when we disagree about the tactics, we all want the same things for ourselves and our children: to be safe, to be at peace, to have food and shelter, respect and opportunity and hope.","Indeed, with the combined social force of Facebook and the immersive power of Oculus Rift, I still think this vision remains possible.","But let’s face some realities:","For all of the promise it may hold, Facebook is a massive data maw that uses variable reward mechanisms to feed our brains dopamine while collecting copious amounts of our personal information.","With this all-consuming hunger for data on the things that make us tick, Facebook is creating the biggest online identity database and the most powerful media-targeting engine ever known.","As a marketer who believes that content marketing will become the dominant form of advertising, this is a boon. When you understand your target market and know how to produce content that engages it, there is simply no better way than Facebook to get this content in front of exactly the right people.","But as someone who cares about the future of democracy and human autonomy and wants these things to persist and not collapse into some form of corporatist totalitarianism, my feelings are a bit more mixed.","In the next couple of posts I write, I’m going to explore some potential trajectories for Facebook’s future. While it’s possible that Facebook’s walls won’t hold up against the multi-front assault from social mobile apps, I think it’s more likely than not that Facebook will be around in some form in 10 years. Some of these forms are beneficent. Others, not so much.","Today, let’s take a look at one of the less ideal paths, where Facebook evolves into the multitool for the modern totalitarian. Like most projections into the future, this is just speculative fiction.","Tool No. 1: Surveillance at Scale","In East Germany under communism, the secret police (the Stasi) gathered data by hand, relying on stakeouts and a massive network of civilian informants to build detailed files on its targets, whose ranks included pretty much everyone.","Under the watchful eyes of the Stasi, whose file cabinets stretched for miles, case agents were responsible for keeping tabs on individuals and groups. Though these agents had large and ever-growing dossiers at their disposal, they were essentially confined to what they could capture on paper and keep in their minds.","The 21st century totalitarian has no patience for this antiquated approach. And nor should he: compared to Internet-scale data collection, the Stasi’s methods are slow, inefficient, and prone to lapses in human judgment.","No, the 21st century totalitarian needs a modern way to capture and catalog the activities, psychologies, and political sentiments of the population in real time. Ideally, this would be a place online where people share freely and regularly about themselves.","Tool No. 2: Data Mining","Of course, collecting massive amounts of data is the (relatively) easy part. Once you have access to a large, rich and ever-growing online identity database, you need algorithms that can mine its activities and uncover threats to the status quo.","Along with potential terrorists, these threats include:","subversives","whistleblowers","radicals","Wouldn’t it be nice if you, the 21st century totalitarian, could build a detailed psychological profile of these types and use your massive identity database and a bit of sophisticated machine learning to find others? Sure, you’d surface a substantial number of false positives, but it’s nothing some light investigation and/or interrogation couldn’t suss out.","With such a tool at your disposal, it’d be like having the pre-cogs from Minority Report, but instead of weirdly-psychic humans drugged up and living in a bath, you’d have an All-Seeing Machine.","Tool No. 3: Mass Manipulation","The 20th century totalitarian relied on absolute control of the flow of information. Writing official textbooks, burning subversive materials, censoring the media, and publishing a non-stop flow of propaganda was simply the way of things. But for the 21st century totalitarian, the fragmentation of TV and the free-form frontiers of the Internet complicates this strategy.","Sure, you could just co-opt cable news, but there are so many channels! Radio? That’s so 1933.","No, while these blunt forms of manipulation work for Fox News and Rush Limbaugh, they are too obvious to work on everyone else.","Today’s totalitarian demands a more subtle way to influence cultural and political sentiment. But if you got your hands on an algorithmically filtered newsfeed? One that could control the stories people see every day and influence their emotions across geographic, political and economic lines? You’d be in business.","Where Does That Leave Us?","I don’t know Mark Zuckerberg personally, but I believe he has a vision that involves eliminating artificial barriers between people and building a better world.","While Facebook has made a few boneheaded privacy blunders in the past, I have been willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt. I have trusted that Zuckerberg and his senior staff have benevolent intentions for the power they are amassing.","But then there was the mood-influence study that scandalized us for a couple of weeks this year. Facebook changed the tone of content showing up in people’s feeds to test the impact it could have on their moods. The results, not too surprisingly, suggested that Facebook has the power to manipulate sentiment at scale.","I’d always sort of worried that Facebook, despite the good intentions of the people building it, could eventually evolve into the Totalitarian Multitool. The disclosure of this study brought the whole thing home.","Even though I’m hopeful that the ideals of democracy and human freedom will persevere against the paranoia of our modern age, there’s a strong case to be made that some of these ideals face a risk of death in the not-too-distant future.","Given how easy it is to scare people about the scary-seeming-but-actually-low-risk Ebola, and how dumb we all get when we are afraid, it is not crazy to think that under the wrong circumstances — like one or two more mass-scale terrorist attacks on major cities — modern democracy gives way to something akin to 1984.","If Big Brother were to seize the reins of power, sure, he’d use the cable news the way it’s being used today. But Facebook’s data maw, targeting power and sentiment-manipulation capabilities would be far more insidious.","Whether this is what we become or not comes down to the future we choose to build."],"isopubdate":"2014-12-05"}

For a decade and a half, Kudlow has been a fixture on CNBC. On Tuesday, March 13, 2018, President Donald Trump said he was looking “very strongly” at naming Kudlow, who has spent decades writing and speaking about economic policy, to be director of the National Economic Council. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)","Heather Nauert, a former co-host of “Fox and Friends,” got promoted on Monday from being a spokeswoman for the State Department to acting undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs. She replaced Steve Goldstein, who was fired because he publicly contradicted the White House’s claim that Rex Tillerson knew he was being fired before Trump announced it on Twitter. (Is it any coincidence that Mike Pompeo got elevated from Langley to Foggy Bottom the morning after he aggressively went to bat for Trump on the Sunday shows?)","— Trump’s plot to poach from green rooms is an additional proof point that validates two important themes I’ve written about: Trump has debased the value of expertise and supercharged the celebrification of American politics.","— The president expressed interest in bringing Bolton, Hegseth and Kudlow on board during the transition, but he was dissuaded by traditionalists who said they weren’t qualified for such powerful posts. The VA secretary, for instance, manages the government’s second-largest bureaucracy, which employs 360,000. But Hegseth is just 37. The Iraq War veteran previously served as the executive director of Concerned Veterans for America, which is in the constellation of groups bankrolled by the billionaire Koch brothers. He ran for Senate in Minnesota against Amy Klobuchar in 2012, but his campaign was such a disaster that he unexpectedly lost the GOP nomination to a random Ron Paul supporter – who went on to lose in the general election by 35 points.","Hegseth’s views on reforming VA “are considered extreme even by some Republicans in Congress,” but Trump frequently calls him to discuss veterans’ policy, The Post’s Lisa Rein reports: “Hegseth has dined at the White House and, during an Oval Office meeting between Trump and Shulkin last week, the president called Hegseth to seek his counsel on pending legislation that would expand private care. He also is disliked by traditional veterans’ advocacy groups, which fear a downsized VA and a privatized system, and which would probably mount a strong campaign against his nomination.”","John Bolton speaks last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)","— Bolton, an outspoken hawk who had a tumultuous and short-lived tenure as George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations, is also seen as too extreme by many Republicans on Capitol Hill, but he wouldn’t need to get confirmed to become national security adviser. “Trump is now comfortable with ousting McMaster, with whom he never personally gelled, but is willing to take time executing the move because he wants to ensure both that the three-star Army general is not humiliated and that there is a strong successor lined up,” The Post’s Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker and Carol D. Leonnig reported Thursday night. “Bolton has met with Trump several times and often agrees with the president’s instincts. Trump also thinks Bolton . . . is good on television.”","Another finalist for the job is Keith Kellogg, the chief of staff of the National Security Council. “Kellogg travels with Trump on many domestic trips, in part because the president likes his company and thinks he is fun,” my colleagues report.","— One reason Kudlow was attractive to Trump is that he can go on business news channels to promote his agenda. Ostensibly, Bolton and Hegseth could do the same. “The president likes me as a media communicator, so I will be more than happy to oblige,” Kudlow said Wednesday night on CNBC. He added that the president had phoned him a few hours earlier when the news broke of his selection to be director of the National Economic Council. “The president called and he said, ‘It’s out,'” Kudlow recalled. “And he said, ‘You’re on the air . . . I’m looking at a picture of you . . . Very handsome!’ So Trumpian.”","Then-Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland watches Jeff Sessions get sworn in as attorney general in the Oval Office last year. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)","— But installing cable pundits in decision-making jobs has not worked out very well for Trump thus far. Foreign policy pros were aghast when Trump named K.T. McFarland as his deputy national security adviser during the transition. She had appeared frequently on Fox as an analyst and anchored her own program called “DEFCON3.” But the last time she’d worked in government was more than three decades earlier, as a junior Pentagon spokeswoman and speechwriter.","Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from San Jose, the Bay Area and beyond.","McFarland got marginalized after Michael Flynn went down. Then Trump nominated her to be ambassador to Singapore, but her nomination needed to be withdrawn when damning emails implicated her in the Russia scandal and imperiled her Senate confirmation.","Trump initially named another Fox talking head, Monica Crowley, as the senior director of strategic communications for the NSC. He stood by her for more than a week as news stories revealed egregious examples of plagiarism over several years, from a 2012 book to her PhD dissertation and op-eds. Just before the inauguration, under pressure, the president-elect dumped her.","Former Navy SEAL Carl Higbie, 34,was forced to resign two months ago as the chief of external affairs for the Corporation for National and Community Service after CNN uncovered bigoted statements he had made about African Americans, immigrants and gays as the host of an Internet radio show. He got the patronage because he had been a go-to Trump defender on Fox, CNN and MSNBC during the 2016 campaign.","America First Priorities, a Trump-sanctioned outside group, hired the 34-year-old on Thursday as its new advocacy director, with the expectation that he’ll again appear on TV to promote the president. “The fact that I’m coming back into the fray does not mean that the president endorses those comments by any stretch,” Higbie told the Hartford Courant on Thursday. “We’ve all said something we’ve regretted. I just happened to say it on the radio. . . . But I’m committed to this administration and its policies.”","An advertisement for “Fox And Friends” outside the show’s studio in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)","— The president reportedly has fewer events on his schedule than he did during the opening year of his presidency so that he can have extra “executive time” in the residence, which appears to be a euphemism for watching television. That’s only intensified the cable news feedback loop. Trump’s tweets routinely echo messages, sometimes word for word, that he heard on Fox minutes earlier. Remember Trump’s tweet about North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s “button”?","The president’s cable habit almost led him to torpedo a compromise his own administration had negotiated to reauthorize Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act in January. “Trump issued an early morning tweet in response to Judge Andrew Napolitano’s criticism on a ‘Fox and Friends’ segment,” Tufts University professor Daniel Drezner notes. “Only direct intervention from the chief of staff, national security adviser, director of national intelligence, CIA director, and House Speaker Paul Ryan convinced Trump to post a follow-up tweet clarifying his position.”","Last Friday, Trump pardoned a former Navy sailor whose conviction for unauthorized retention of national defense information had made him a cause celebre on Fox. Commentators have often argued that the year he served in prison for taking pictures aboard a submarine showed Hillary Clinton was treated too leniently for how she mishandled classified material.","Kristian Saucier, 31, who is now a garbage collector in Vermont, had appeared on “Fox and Friends” earlier in the week to press his case. “Obviously, there’s two different sets of laws in this country, for the political elite and for, you know, those lower-level, individuals, Americans, like myself,” he said. “I think my case draws a very clear example of that.”","“A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on its involvement, if any, in the process,” The Post’s Matt Zapotosky reports.","The only other pardon Trump has issued since taking office was for Joe Arpaio, who also frequently appears on Fox shows. The former Arizona sheriff was convicted of criminal contempt of court for ignoring a federal judge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos.","— Trump plainly enjoys the company of people he sees on TV. Trump invited Sebastian Gorka, a lightning rod who got fired from the White House last year but now spends a lot of time defending the president on Fox, over for dinner last week. Jesse Watters, a co-host of Fox’s “The Five,” joined them. “According to a White House official and two other sources familiar with the meeting, Trump invited Gorka and Watters because ‘he couldn’t get enough of them on TV,’ as one source put it, and wanted to confab with them about what he’d seen on Fox News, politics, gossip, and his administration,” The Daily Beast reported.","— The embattled president also appears to be putting a greater premium on loyalty as he makes personnel decisions. He clearly feels burned by some of his early hiring decisions. For example, Trump interviewed Jeanine Pirro, the host of Fox’s “Justice with Judge Jeanine,” to be deputy attorney general. Instead, he went along with Rod Rosenstein, a respected DOJ insider who he had no prior relationship with. That’s a decision he’s repeatedly said that he regrets.","— Trump’s embrace of talking heads has become a punchline in popular culture. “To help find [Gary Cohn’s] replacement, the president turned to his most trusted confidante: the TV in his bedroom,” Comedy Central host Trevor Noah said on “The Daily Show” Thursday night. “Basically, if Trump sees you on TV, there’s a really good chance that he’ll hire you. By the time his term is done, his attorney general is going to be ‘Judge Judy’ and his housing secretary will be ‘Bob the Builder.'”","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to permanently dismantle his main nuclear complex at Nyongbyon if the United States takes corresponding measures, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Wednesday after the two leaders held summit talks in Pyongyang to try to sustain nuclear diplomacy with Washington."],"isopubdate":"2002-01-10"}

It collects data from a wide range of sources, including social media platforms such as Facebook, and its own polling.","With its headquarters in London, the firm was set up in 2013 as an offshoot of another company called SCL Group, which offers similar services around the world.","In an interview with the website Contagious, Cambridge Analytica’s founder, Alexander Nix said it had been set up “to address the vacuum in the US Republican political market” that became evident when Mitt Romney was defeated in the 2012 presidential election.","“The Democrats had ostensibly been leading the tech revolution, and data analytics and digital engagement were areas where Republicans had failed to catch up. We saw this as an opportunity.”","Why is it in the news?","Kogan assembled the information through an app on the site – it collected details of Americans who were paid to take a personality test, but also gathered data on those people’s Facebook friends.","Kogan had a deal to share this information with Cambridge Analytica. But according to a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, most of this personal information had been taken without authorisation. He said Cambridge Analytica used it to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.","In a statement published on Saturday, the company denied any wrongdoing and said it did not harvest Facebook data, and none was used in the 2016 presidential election. It said it fully complied with Facebook’s terms of service and it had deleted all the data it received from GSR.","What does Facebook say?","It has suspended Cambridge Analytica and several individuals from its site while it investigates. It denies there was a data breach, and says it had granted Kogan permission to access the information. However, in sharing it with Cambridge Analytica and allowing it to be used for commercial purposes, he broke the terms of the licence.","“People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” it said.","It said it learned about the issue in 2015 and removed the app and demanded that the data was destroyed.","Who runs Cambridge Analytica?","The company is part of SCL Group and shares some of its directors. The main player is 42-year-old Nix, an old Etonian who joined SCL in 2003 after studying at Manchester University and working in corporate finance. Nix developed the political arm of the business. Last year, he told Techcrunch of plans to publish a book about the company, provisionally titled ‘Mad men to maths men’.","The managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division is Mark Turnbull, who spent 18 years at the communications firm Bell Pottinger before joining SCL.","What are Cambridge Analytica’s links with Donald Trump?","Robert Mercer, a key Trump supporter and donor, gave $15m in funding to Cambridge Analytica. Mercer, who also funded the rightwing website Breitbart, was introduced to the firm by Steve Bannon. Bannon, who was on its board from 2014 to 2016, headed the last phase of Trump’s election campaign and then served as his chief strategist.","The company worked on three candidates’ campaigns for the presidency, including Trump’s. On its website it describes analysing millions of data points to identify the most persuadable voters and the issues they cared about and then sending them messages to “move them to action”. Voters in 17 states were polled every day, and online advertising and social media used to send them messages. The company claims that in this way it boosted donations and turn out and contributed to Trump’s victory.","As we now know, some of the data came from profiles to which the company was not supposed to have access, rather than being freely available to harvest.","What other campaigns has it been involved with?","The company has worked on political campaigns in countries including Kenya, Colombia, India and St Kitts & Nevis.","What about Brexit?","What happens next?","There are likely to be questions for Cambridge Analytica and Facebook to answer. Nix may be asked by MPs to explain his position over Facebook data.","In the UK, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","In the US, Robert Mueller has asked for emails from the firm as part of his inquiry into Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election.","• This article was amended on 19 March 2018 to correct the spelling of Colombia."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}

After the redesign, those settings will be accessible from just one place; previously, settings were spread out across almost 20 pages, Facebook said.","The company also said it was adding a specific menu for privacy shortcuts. That menu will include options to turn on two-factor authentication, manage ad preferences and determine who can see information on a user's Facebook profile.","\"We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find and that we must do more to keep people informed,\" company executives wrote in the blog post. \"Most of these updates have been in the works for some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.\"","Facebook also will add a feature called \"Access Your Information\" so users can see what they've posted and reacted to, as well as things they've searched for.

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

He was asked to attend the hearing by Greg Walden and Frank Pallone, committee members, who have both voiced their approval that Zuckerberg will speak before them.","Politicians on both sides of Atlantic have demanded answers after it emerged that Cambridge Analytica and university professor harvested the details of millions of Facebook users through a third party app. Yesterday Zuckerberg revealed the number of profiles collected by the company - initially reported as 50 million - was as high as 87 million, including one million in the UK.","Cambridge Analytica was allegedly partly funded by Trump supporter Robert Mercer and reportedly used the Facebook users' information to US president on his presidential campaign.","Facebook has since updated its terms of service policies and data usage information, explaining that it will not sell the information it holds about anyone to any third party. The company also made a public apology to its users via a newspaper ad published last week.","On a telephone conference with media yesterday, Zuckerberg he expects his Congress hearing \"is going to cover a lot of ground\".","\"I am going to be sending one of our top folks [to the UK],\" he added. \"I believe it’s going to be [Mike Schroepfer], the CTO, or Chris Cox, the product officer. These are the top folks who I run the company with - to answer additional questions from countries and other places.\"","28/03/2018: Mark Zuckerberg 'will testify to Congress', but not Parliament","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to face Congress to answer questions over his company's involvement in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.","Zuckerberg has reportedly accepted an invitation to testify before the House's energy and commerce committee, just a day after he turned down Parliament's request to appear before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee (read below).","The billionaire instead nominated two of his deputies to appear before the House of Commons, and Damian Collins MP, the committee chair, described Facebook's offer to send the company's chief technology officer or chief product officer in Zuckerberg's place as \"absolutely astonishing\". He invited chief product officer Chris Cox to attend, but not before pressing Zuckerberg on his decision to sidestep the session himself.","\"Given the seriousness of these issues we still believe that Mark Zuckerberg is the right person to give evidence, and would like him to confirm if he will make himself available to the committee,\" Collins said.","It's not clear why Zuckerberg has allegedly decided to give evidence to Congress but not to Parliament. The claim was reported by both CNN Money, citing unnamed Facebook sources, and The Guardian, which gives the Congress hearing date as 12 April.","The Senate judiciary committee's chairman, Chuck Grassley, has also formally invited Zuckerberg to testify in front of his committee on 10 April, although there's currently no indication of whether or not the Facebook CEO has accepted. It's also reported by the Guardian that the Senate commerce committee wants him to give evidence too.","IT Pro has contacted Facebook to confirm whether Zuckerberg will in fact be appearing in front of a congressional committee, but hadn't received a response at the time of publication.","Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and founder of Facebook, has declined a request to personally answer a Parliamentary committee's questions about his company's use of user data.","Following revelations of potential data misuse by Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly harvested 50 million Facebook profiles without their consent, Damian Collins, chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, wrote to Zuckerberg requesting the social media firm send a representative to face questioning by the parliamentary committee, suggesting the 33-year-old should himself attend.","In a response to the MP issued yesterday, Facebook's head of public policy in the UK, Rebecca Stimson, said Zuckerberg would not attend, but has instead asked the chief technology officer and chief product officer to make themselves available.","\"Facebook fully recognizes the level of public and Parliamentary interest in these issues and support your belief that these issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position to answer your questions,\" she said. \"As such, Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence in person to the Committee.\"","The nominated representatives are CTO Mike Schroepfer, who is \"responsible for Facebook's technology including the company's developer platform\" — something that lies at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica scandal — and CPO Chris Cox, who \"leads development of Facebook's core products and features including News Feed\".","Stimson's letter points out that the two are some of the longest-serving staff members, report directly to the CEO and, due to their positions, will be \"well placed to answer the Committee's questions on these complex subjects\".","She also laid out steps Facebook is taking to protect user data in the future and investigations it's carrying out now to determine the extent of the nonconsensual data collection allegedly carried out by Cambridge Analytica through its platform.","Collins responded this morning, saying the committee would ask Cox to attend, but expressed dismay that Zuckerberg would not appear as requested.","\"Given the seriousness of these issues we still believe that Mark Zuckerberg is the right person to give evidence, and would like him to confirm if he will make himself available to the Committee,\" Collins said. \"He stated in interviews that if he is the right person to appear he will appear.

He left that position in 2012.","On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica “raises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.”","He added, “I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.”","The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing app and the Facebook “friends” of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used “like” button on social media posts or news stories.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company’s possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large.","“That’s the maximum exposure, though it’s not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,” he said.","The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook — in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings.","The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook’s privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree.","Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations.","The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data.","Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015.","Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree.","She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, “bespeaks the same recklessness with its users’ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.”","Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that Facebook report any “unauthorized access to data” to the FTC.","“Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,” wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. “Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.”","Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement.","Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled users’ sensitive information with little warning.","The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users’ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users’ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate.","As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers’ consent before “enacting changes that override their privacy practices,” the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement.","Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who say the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps.","“This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission’s failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can’t do the job.”","Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incident in which Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate.","The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter — and it never appeared to take additional action.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Its leader, Matthew Heimbach was arrested Tuesday for allegedly assaulting his wife and his spokesman after Heimbach was caught cheating on his wife with the spokesman’s wife.","David “Matt” Parrott was the party’s spokesperson until Tuesday, when he quit in a statement to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Parrott told The Daily Beast the incident might be the end for the white nationalist group. “People have lost faith in the party on every level,” he said.","Parrott scrapped the TWP’s website after quitting because he believes the party to be dead, he said.","The implosion began at a TWP compound in Paoli, Indiana, where Parrott’s wife, Jessica, was allegedly having an affair with Heimbach—who is married to Parrott’s stepdaughter from a previous marriage.","Heimbach and Jessica told Parrott they’d ended the relationship, but Parrott and Heimbach’s wife were skeptical. They arranged to “set up” Heimbach and Jessica in a trailer on Parrott’s property to catch them having sex.","Parrott stood on a box outside the trailer and watched Heimbach and Jessica have sex inside, according to a police report. When the box broke under Parrott’s weight, he entered the trailer to confront them. Heimbach allegedly choked him and chased him into a house, where Parrott threw a chair at him. Heimbach hit back, choking him into unconsciousness, according to the police report.","Parrott fled to a Walmart near his home and called police around 1 a.m. Tuesday morning.","After interviewing Parrott, police went to Heimbach’s home, where they met him outside with Jessica who said she was just a neighbor and left. Heimbach went inside and sent his own wife out instead, telling her “to send the police away and tell them everything was fine,” the police report reads. Heimbach “began to raise his voice at her and I heard scuffling and [Heimbach’s wife] yelling,” an officer wrote.","“Parrott stood on a box outside the trailer and watched Heimbach and Jessica have sex inside, according to a police report.”","Heimbach’s wife accused him of becoming violent when she refused to dismiss the police. “He kicked the wall, and then grabbed my cheeks, making them bleed, and threw me with the and on my face onto the bed,” she wrote to police. “I have a recording of this.”","Police arrested Heimbach on the spot and charged him with battery, intimidation, strangulation, and domestic battery committed in the physical presence of a child.

Facebook is finally under scrutiny for its alleged role in leaking the personal data of nearly 50 million users which shaped political events such as Donald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Elections of 2016, and the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom.","The crisis itself involves a data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica that played a significant role in bringing Donald Trump to power in America. Excellent and daring journalism by the British show Channel 4 News revealed how executives at Cambridge Analytica were willing to influence local elections in Sri Lanka by discrediting political rivals through underhand tactics such as staging false encounters with escorts and catching them on camera.","The channel’s investigation also revealed how the data analytics company played a similarly sinister role in Donald Trump’s victory in 2016 elections by manipulating the personal data of millions of Facebook users.","For its part, Facebook’s culpability lies in its inability to prevent third parties from accessing the private data of its users. In 2014, 270,000 Facebook users participated in a ‘personality quiz’ on Facebook.","These users were unaware that the test in fact extracted information of these persons’ Facebook friends as well, eventually gaining access to the personal data of nearly fifty million people.","Ostensibly, the access to more political news and to products that we are interested in contributes to technological advancements to make our lives easier. But in reality, this manipulation of data comes at the cost of our privacy and consent","This data was later shared with Cambridge Analytica which then used data models to disseminate pro-Trump propaganda and influence users’ views towards Donald Trump’s election campaign in the 2016 election.","Facebook is thus under immense pressure for its utter lack of control and its mismanagement of users’ personal data. Although Facebook suspended the application that started the personality test in 2014, whistle-blower Sandy Parakilas — who used to work at Facebook — claims that Facebook’s checks to prevent this leakage of data to third parties are ‘non-existent’.","This sordid episode highlights the dangers that surround social media and the increasing ‘virtualisation’ of our personal lives. Although it is true that platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have revolutionized communications and news-telling, it is equally true that they have made all of us vulnerable to influence from state organs, intelligence agencies and corporations.","Everything we say or do is recorded on social media and gives fodder to companies such as Cambridge Analytica to influence our opinions and shape political events. Social media platforms remain active sources for people to express their political viewpoints — and rightly so, but these supposedly innocuous expressions of our personal opinions are then used by data mining companies to feed us propaganda that promotes their own sinister agendas.","Similarly, Facebook has also been at the vanguard of promoting a pervasive form of consumerism that thrives on an active social media presence. Marketing and data analytics agencies assess our interests and likes on social media platforms, and accordingly suggest products that we might be interested in buying.","On the surface, this access to more political news and to products that we are interested in consuming gives credit to technological advancements that make our lives easier. Dig a little deeper, and we witness how this manipulation of data rests solely on violating our privacy and which negates any sense of consent.","It violates all norms of privacy because companies such as Cambridge Analytica are misusing the personal data of millions of users. And it completely ignores consent because when we express political views on social media, we do not consent to third parties using these views to shove propaganda down our throats.","Our online presence also makes us vulnerable to profiling from certain states and intelligence agencies. It is true that many nations such as the United States silence dissent and police minority voices — including of Muslims, leftists and ethnic minorities—by scrutinizing our private data, and by holding us culpable for something as innocuous as ‘liking’ an article or a page on Facebook.","This near-present surveillance of the internet, in fact, is a far more potent tool to silence dissent and to force opposition movements into submission by denying them the space to organize or to grow intellectually.","Unfortunately, the near ubiquitous presence of the internet and of social media suggests that the struggle to regain control over our own words and over our online presence is an uphill battle. However, we must take the first step by holding large corporations such as Facebook responsible for manipulating our data and for surreptitiously influencing political events.","For it is these large corporations that benefit from the rise of demagogues such as Donald Trump who promulgate tax-cuts and benefit the CEOs of these corporations. We must also criticize the mass-consumerism that is coming to define our society and which is a product of the rapid spread of social media and of e-marketing.","There is no doubt that doing all of this is an immense challenge. But it is a challenge that we must earnestly accept and struggle for, for it is the only way we can make the virtual space safe for all of us.","The writer graduated from Aitchison College and from Cornell University with a Bachelors in Economics and History.

But the lawmaker comments reflected mounting bipartisan concern in Washington over whether internet firms are fair trustees of the massive amounts of user data they collect.","Some technology lobbyists have begun to quietly acknowledge the era of a hands-off approach to Silicon Valley from U.S. policymakers may be fading.","On Monday, the Senate was expected to move forward with a bill that would chip away at the internet industry’s legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking. The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law.","Facebook said on Friday it had learned in 2015 that a Cambridge University psychology professor lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from a psychology testing app he had built.","Facebook said it suspended the firms and researchers involved.

The plan is to release the device by May 2018, but the date could change.","During the initial development of Aloha, Facebook employees conducted focus groups to understand how the device could be marketed. They received overwhelming concern that Facebook would use the device to spy on users, people familiar with the matter said.","The Aloha's ability to recognize people through its camera also caused privacy concerns. Facebook rented a house to test the device in various rooms and people who were asked to test Aloha said they felt uncomfortable having the device recognize them in private spaces, like bedrooms.","To assuage concerns about privacy, Facebook has considered creative ways to market Aloha, including pitching it as a device for letting the elderly easily communicate with their families.

Wasn’t pushing to run through one of his existing firms. Clearly wants to be head outside advisor, but didn’t seem like he wanted to push others out. Clearly wants to get going. He’s still in DC tomorrow and would like to meet with you if you are in DC in the afternoon. I think it’s worth doing.”","What did the meeting lead to? As of this week, Schmidt hasn’t bothered to donate a cent directly to Clinton’s campaign. Instead, he has leveraged his Silicon Valley acumen to generate a new source of influence.","Start-ups for Hillary","Schmidt donated $5,000 to Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign and advised it on digital operations; afterward, he invested in several start-ups founded by talented engineers and analysts who worked for the campaign, and had developed new ways to use campaign data to improve advertising and voter-turnout operations.","One of those firms, The Groundwork, is now the Clinton campaign’s top technology vendor, earning more than $600,000 in fees since the campaign began, according to federal campaign finance disclosures. Last year, Quartz reported on the Groundwork’s stealthy role in developing a technology platform that would develop the infrastructure to manage the campaign’s data and tools to engage voters.","Now, with e-mails stolen from Podesta’s e-mail account by Russian hackers available on the internet, we have more clues to how Schmidt contributed to Clinton’s use of election tech.","(Her campaign refused to confirm the accuracy of any of these e-mails or comment for this story; Schmidt did not reply to an e-mail seeking comment.)","Podesta meets Schmidt","Podesta is a longtime Democratic insider. Schmidt is the billionaire technology executive who became Barack Obama’s primary link to Silicon Valley’s boardrooms. Their first 2014 meeting confirms that Schmidt was involved discussions of the campaign’s strategy from the get-go.","AP Photo/Charles Dharapak","Schmidt and Obama at a White House meeting in 2009.","At the time Podesta and Schmidt met, Clinton’s core staff were discussing how her online infrastructure could seamlessly move from an exploratory committee to a full-fledged campaign when the time was right.","“The thing he really pressed me hard on was geography,” Podesta wrote of their meeting. ”Very committed to the idea that this be done in a city where young coders would want to be, preferably outer borough NYC. Thought No Cal was priced out of the market and too into itself. Thought DC lacked talent in this arena.”","Schmidt’s strategy memo","Two weeks later, Schmidt sent a memo to Clinton aide Cheryl Mills outlining his ideas for the campaign. “Lets assume a total budget of about $1.5Billion, with more than 5000 paid employees and million(s) of volunteers,” he began. “The entire startup ceases operation four days after November 8, 2016.” Much of the memo’s content would have been old hat to other staffers who saw it: Podesta, Mook, and David Plouffe, the veteran Obama operative.","But Schmidt’s outline gave clues to the basic tech challenges he foresaw building on Obama’s 2012 effort. Clinton, he said, would need to push vendors and her staff to move their technology to the cloud so it would scale more easily and to avoid expensive investments in servers. And he saw the need for new tools to integrate the various datasets—voter files, social media profiles, cable box records—into one system.","“Key is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all that is known about them,” he wrote. “In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify, meet, and update profiles on the voter….[q]uite a bit of software is to be developed to match digital identities with the actual voter file with high confidence.”","Schmidt also recognized concerns—voiced by others in the campaign, and common in the world of high-dollar political consulting—that vendors would seek to exploit the campaign for financial gain.","“Its important that all the player in the campaign work at cost and there be no special interests in the financing structure,” Schmidt wrote, proposing audits to ensure no one was earning money on the sly. “The rules of the audit should include caps on individual salaries and no investor profits from the campaign function. (For example, this rule would apply to me.)”","Laying the Groundwork","The Groundwork was formed as a Delaware LLC with Schmidt’s backing two months later, in June 2014. As Schmidt advised, its offices were in Brooklyn, blocks from the building that would eventually house Clinton’s campaign headquarters. The company’s leader. Michael Slaby, had been one of Obama’s top digital staffers in 2012. (He did not respond to a request for comment on this story.)","Slaby hired top engineers from companies like Netflix and Google to build the unsexy but critical back-end infrastructure for signing up supporters and collecting donations, with plans to market the platform to corporate clients through the Groundwork’s parent company, Timshel, also backed by Schmidt.","“There are a lot of people who can write big checks,” Slaby told Quartz last year. “Eric recognizes how the technology he’s been building his whole career can be applied to different spaces. The idea of tech as a force multiplier is something he deeply understands.”","Slaby would not be the only talent that Schmidt helped bring to the campaign. The campaign’s influential chief technology officer, Stephanie Hannon, is a veteran Google engineer. Civis, another company founded by former Obama staffers and funded by Schmidt, has provided some media analytics for the campaign.","Sometimes, the recruiting efforts fell flat. Mook wrote to Podesta the same month that the Groundwork was founded, asking him to call Mikey Dickerson, a former Google technologist who worked on Obama’s campaign and then parachuted in to Washington to help rescue healthcare.gov when the website floundered.","“We are desperately trying to get him to oversee the Eric Schmidt project,” Mook wrote.”He’s apparently open to doing it but a little worried about how legit it is and what it means for later on. I was hoping you could call him to tell him how important the project is and how much faith higher ups would have in his ability to deliver a really good product…and how that would inevitably mean a position later.”","Their effort failed; Dickerson is currently employed at the US Digital Service, which bills itself as “a startup at the White House” that works to bring the best technology and practices to government agencies.","Hillary’s AI curiosity","At some point, Schmidt met with Clinton herself to discuss the effort. The candidate had at least some interest in the nuts and bolts of her campaign’s technology, requesting updates on her website ahead of her candidacy’s launch and at one point e-mailing her team to ask about Facebook’s decision to open-source artificial intelligence technology. (The answer, attributed to her campaign digital director Teddy Goff, was that “AI may be more 2020 than 2016.”)","Google","Clinton and Schmidt at a 2014 Google event just days after the Groundwork was incorporated.","Schmidt also requested a meeting with former president Bill Clinton in February 2015. “[I]t is about the business [Schmidt] proposes to do with the campaign,” Tina Flournoy, Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, wrote. “He says he’s met with HRC.” “Yup,” Podesta replies. “I’ve talked to him too. Robby is in touch with his team.”","Flournoy also mentioned that Google was lending its corporate jet to fly the former president to Africa that summer as part of a Clinton Foundation trip, with the two joking about previous times that it had broken down.","It’s all “gravy”","It’s not clear today how much value the Groundwork’s tools ultimately provided to the campaign; some Democratic sources suggest the internal tools developed by Hannon’s team have solved problems the Groundwork once x`aspired to tackle. For all its success, Obama’s 2012 technology team lacked a cohesive management structure, and returning staffers wanted to avoid siloed teams or campaign officials who felt outranked by better-paid vendors.","“Imagine you’re a mid-level person inside the campaign, or even the campaign manager,” one veteran Democratic operative said last year. “Who’s going to say, ‘Hey, billionaire smartest tech guy on the planet, thanks but no thanks?’”","In October 2014, a draft memo on digital strategy written by Mook for Hillary Clinton discusses “Eric Schmidt’s company Groundwork,” then a ten-person team developing a dynamic sign-up page and donation tool to be deployed by the campaign when it launched more than six months later. It suggests that campaign staff were eager to have control over their own core technology.","“Eric’s team is NOT building a ‘complete website’, which I know he sometimes implies,” Mook wrote. “Speaking candidly, it’s fantastic that Eric has devoted resources to creating these new tools and it’s resource a potential campaign can leverage, but we are in no way depending on him and will consider anything his team delivers as ‘gravy.'”"],"isopubdate":"2016-11-01"}

According to the Financial Times, reporters posed as prospective clients and secretly filmed a series of meetings, including one with the chief executive. The report is due to air this week.","Collins, the chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be recalling Nix to give further testimony to explain why he had told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook.","“We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments,” he said.","Collins will also call on Zuckerberg to testify. He said the company appeared to have previously sent executives who were able to avoid difficult questions and who “claimed not to know the answers”.","The two men may also face a summons from US lawmakers. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Cambridge Analytica to be “thoroughly investigated” and said Facebook must answer questions about how it came to provide private user information to an academic with links to Russia.","The Republican majority on the House intelligence committee announced this week they were winding up their investigation into Russia’s election interference, concluding there was no collusion with Trump’s campaign and, even more controversially, that Moscow did not seek to assist him. Schiff fiercely condemned that decision and said the Democratic minority would continue working on prescriptions for protecting the country in the future.","“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users, whether it acquired that information illegally and whether it sought to abuse that information in support of President Trump’s political campaign in the United States or Brexit in the United Kingdom,” he told the Guardian.","“The company has repeatedly touted its ability to influence voters through ‘psychographic’ targeting and has claimed it was the fundamental reason that Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Indeed, it may be that through Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign made use of illegitimately acquired data on millions of Americans in order to help sway the election.”","Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2m, according to Federal Election Commission records. It denies using any Facebook data in the campaign.","Shortly before the story broke, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer that it was making “false and defamatory” allegations and reserved Facebook’s legal position. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by Cambridge Analytica, working with Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), was a data breach.","It also suspended the whistleblower Chris Wylie from the platform “pending further information” over misuse of data, along with his former employer Cambridge Analytica and its affiliates, and the academic they worked with, Kogan.","The public attack on Wylie came after he had approached the tech company about the data breach, offering to help investigate. He described it as a chilling attack on someone acting in the public interest.","“They acknowledged my offer but then turned around and shot the messenger. I’m trying to make amends for my mistakes and so should Facebook,” he told the Guardian. “Facebook has known about this for at least two years and did almost nothing to fix it. This is not new. And it’s only by coming forward that Facebook is now taking action. People need to know this kind of profiling is happening.”","Collins said his committee wanted more information from Facebook about the circumstances around the breach. “Data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns. Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”","“We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,” Collins said. “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”","Last month, both Facebook representatives and Nix told the parliamentary inquiry into fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data, or any data from GSR.","Play Video","0:25","Cambridge Analytica chief denies working with Facebook data - video","But in its statement on Friday night, explaining why it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, Facebook said it had known in 2015 that profiles were passed to Nix’s company.","“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our ‘platform policies’ by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica,” the statement said.","Collins attacked Facebook for appearing to have been “deliberately avoiding answering straight questions” in testimony to the committee.","“It is now clear that data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns,” Collins said. “Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”","Cambridge Analytica responded to the Observer story on Twitter before Collins had said Nix would be recalled. “We refute(s) these mischaracterizations and false allegations,” it said.","“Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data,” the company said. “When we learned GSR sold us Facebook data that it shouldn’t have done, we deleted it all – system wide audit to verify.”","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCL’s projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary – featuring on Wired’s list of “25 Geniuses who are creating the future of business” – and derided as a snake oil salesman.","Controversies","Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its role in elections on both sides of the Atlantic, working on Brexit and Donald Trump’s election team. It is a key subject in two inquiries in the UK – by the Electoral Commission, into the firm’s possible role in the EU referendum, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, into data analytics for political purposes – and one in the US, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump-Russia collusion. The Observer revealed this week that the company had harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. Emma Graham-Harrison","Photograph: The Washington Post","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The company, and Nix, are under pressure from politicians in the US and the UK to explain how it handled the data and what role the information played in its campaigns, if any.","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham criticised Cambridge Analytica for being “unco-operative” with her investigation as she confirmed that her watchdog would apply for a warrant to help her examine the firm’s activities.","Cambridge Analytica has sold itself as the ultimate hi-tech consultant, winning votes by using data to pinpoint target groups and design messages that will appeal powerfully to their interests, although it denies using Facebook information in its work.","But in the undercover investigation by Channel 4 News, in association with the Observer, executives claimed to offer a much darker range of services.","In a series of meetings with a reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence, Cambridge Analytica executives initially denied the company was in the business of using entrapment techniques.","But Nix later detailed the dirty tricks the company would be prepared to pull behind the scenes to help its clients.","When the reporter asked if Cambridge Analytica could offer investigations into the damaging secrets of rivals, Nix said it worked with former spies from Britain and Israel to look for political dirt. He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation.","“Oh, we do a lot more than that,” he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. “Deep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true and make sure that that’s video recorded.","“You know these sort of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption.”","Nix suggested one possible scenario, in which the managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division, Mark Turnbull, would pose as a wealthy developer looking to exchange campaign finance for land. “I’m a master of disguise,” Turnbull said.","Another option, Nix suggested, would be to create a sex scandal. “Send some girls around to the candidate’s house, we have lots of history of things,” he told the reporter. “We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know what I’m saying.”","He said these were hypothetical scenarios, but suggested his ideas were based on precedent. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying, because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done, what has been done.”","Any work may have stayed out of the spotlight partly because Cambridge Analytica works hard to cover traces of its operations, Nix said, using a shifting network of names and front groups.","“We’re used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you,” Nix told the source in a first phone call.","Cambridge Analytica sometimes contracts under a different name, so that there are no records of its involvement, Turnbull said. That does not only protect the company, but also makes its work more efficient, he is recorded saying.","“It has to happen without anyone thinking it’s propaganda, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’ the next question is: ‘Who’s put that out?’”","He added: “It may be that we have to contract under a different name ... a different entity, with a different name, so that no record exists with our name attached to this at all.”","In a recent project in eastern Europe, the company sent a team but “no one even knew they were there, they were just ghosted in, did the work, ghosted out”, Turnbull said.","Covers include the setting up of fake academic projects, sometimes simply going in on tourist visas, as former employees have told the Guardian they did for US elections – apparently employed in violation of Federal law.","Nix also offered details regarding the services of professional ex-spies from Britain and Israel. “We have two projects at the moment, which involve doing deep deep depth research on the opposition and providing source ... really damaging source material, that we can decide how to deploy in the course of the campaign.”","Denham told Channel 4 News that she had issued a demand for access to Cambridge Analytica earlier this month. They were given until 6pm on Monday to respond to it, but she said the company had been “unco-operative” with the investigation and that she would be applying to the courts on Tuesday for a warrant. “We need to get in there. We need to look at the databases. We need to look at the servers and understand how data was processed or deleted by Cambridge Analytica. There are a lot of conflicting stories about the data,” she said.","It accused Channel 4 of setting out to entrap staff by initiating a conversation about unethical practices. It rejected any suggestion that the company used fake news, honey traps, bribes or entrapment.","It said: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Anlytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever … Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.”","Of the suggestions they used honey trap techniques, the company said: “Our executives humoured these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to further disclose his intentions.”","In a later statement Cambridge Analytica accused Channel 4 News of attempting to entrap its executives by initiating a conversation about unethical practices, which it insisted the company did not use.","Admitting he misjudged the situation, Nix said: “In playing along with this line of conversation … we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks … I deeply regret my role in the meeting and I have already apologised to staff.

{"originalurl":"http://www.perc.org.uk/project_posts/control-surveillance-capitalism-benthams-panopticon-zuckerbergs-like/","title":"Control under surveillance capitalism: from Bentham’s panopticon to Zuckerberg’s 'Like' - Political Economy Research Centre","text":["Control under surveillance capitalism: from Bentham’s panopticon to Zuckerberg’s ‘Like’","Surveillance capitalism has transformed regimes of techno-capitalist control. Domination is no longer exercised through Bentham’s ‘Panopticon’ but Zuckerberg’s ‘Like’, flowing primarily not from physical and external power exerted on the body but through ubiquitous digital surveillance, the data it yields and the behavioural changes this enables. This marriage of neoliberal rationality and geolocational technologies that track and trace everyday life has led to an explosion in capitalist power that threatens our democracy, imperils foundational liberal principles and practices, and is driving spiralling inequality. That is the deeper story of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica revelations. The lesson: in a society of ubiquitous surveillance, we urgently need a politics capable of developing new forms of democratic power, of our data, of our economy, of ourselves.","Lenin once predicted a time where ‘all of society will become a factory.’ That future has arrived, as our world has been resculpted for the smooth, voracious and unending accumulation and commodification of data. Our relationships and networks, our physical infrastructures, our devices, all are being repurposed for data extraction and profit. The agents driving this are the security state and, crucially, and complicitly, the dominant platform companies. While the major platform monopolies are diverse in form, they are united in purpose: the extraction and analysis of data in ever widening domains of life to generate immense economic reward. Our common resource – collectively produced data – drives this process of capital formation, a contemporary form of accumulation by dispossession. Their goal then is universal: the enclosure and monetisation of all of society through the boundless accumulation and analysis of behavioural data.","These firms – including Facebook, Google, and Amazon – have developed a new logic of accumulation, what Shoshana Zuboff calls ‘surveillance capitalism’ and what Nick Srnicek terms ‘platform capitalism’. They occupy the commanding heights of the contemporary economy. Powered by an alliance of the pervasive reach of digital technologies, finance capital, and a form of neoliberal rationality matched to Californian libertarianism, this new economic mode is based on unilateral surveillance to enable the major platforms to profit from the analysis of mass behavioural data. They do this through providing goods and services on their digital infrastructure – the platform – which acts as the site for the mass collection of information. All their efforts bend to the goal of increasing, in Zuboff’s words, ‘the harvest of behavioral surplus from people, bodies, things, processes, and places in both the virtual and the real world,’ and the transformation of that behavioural data into profits and power. The new means of production is consequently the application of immensely powerful AI and machine learning to generate profitable insights from data generated through the use of their platforms. In the short term, this is through selling information to advertisers generated from behavioural data; in the longer term, it is the training of AI and robotic systems that threaten our analytical and physical eclipse and labour’s redundancy.","Capitalism is consequently mutating. As Zuboff argues, whereas profits once flowed from goods and services, then financial speculation, today it is from surveillance and the monetisation of mass behavioural data. Prediction is consequently the product, the selling of our attention and the promise from the platforms that their algorithmic power married to digital surveillance can alter our behaviour.","The increasing fulfilment of that promise means the disciplinary, punishing institutions of the state and capital that were central to the regulation and operation of industrial and post-industrial capitalism are giving way to more pervasive and in some sense more totalising forms of power and control. The technologies of digtialisation – tracking technologies, cloud systems, immense computer power, and the smartphone, the sovereign device of the ‘Big Data’ society – have enabled a regime of technological domination that uncovers and feeds off our own psychological disclosures, as the theorist Byung-Chul Han suggests. Our movements, our emotions, our networks are surveilled, often without explicit consent. But they are also self-disclosed, our Facebook status updates, Instagram locations, and Google searches generating a more expansive modern digital panopticon, a new architecture of comprehensive surveillance and potential control. Foucault’s biopolitics – the processes and strategies by which human life is managed by a disciplinary state under regimes of authority over knowledge, power and subjectivity – has consequently been eclipsed by control through ‘datafication’ and the self-surveilled subject.","At the same time, ubiquitous connectivity, data capture, and algorithmic analysis erode the separate domains of society, so vital to liberalism, and collapse distinct forms of evaluations and measurement into one ruled by ‘Like’. In this sense, the boundless drive of surveillance capitalism and its dominant platforms to enclose and ‘know’ its subjects and their behaviours is the apotheosis of neoliberal rationality, which seeks the economisation of society and the neutering of the uncertain, hopeful natality of political life. Wendy Brown’s argument that neoliberalism is the encoding of all fields of activity within an economic register, that transforms every action into a market action, finds its most complete form (so far) in the fact that almost digital activities are transformed into a act of profit, an economic stream, for the platform giants. All acts become market acts, all actions ultimately written in an economic register, all of society turned into a site for digital labour and an engine of accumulation.Homo digitalus under surveillance capitalism then is inescapably homo economicus.","Foundational liberal values and norms are consequently threatened by the marriage of the boundless ambition of the platform giants combined with their ability to transform data into products for prediction and manipulation. If the wealth and purpose of these firms is generated directly by their ability to alter and intervene in human behaviour at scale, then privacy, autonomy, and democratic sovereignty are imperilled. Attention, and the social, political and economic relationships it sustains, is corroded. We cannot help but use the digital infrastructure they command in modern society. But if doing so provides the means by which certain privileged actors can intervene, manipulate, and reshape society then self-determination, individually and collectively, is threatened. Of course, we still live in a society of privacy, self-determination and autonomy, it is just they are unequally divided. The great usurpers of data, who accumulate without end, are themselves opaque, the exemplification of the ‘black box society’. This profound inequality undermines democratic integrity.","The dual quality of surveillance capitalism and its platform actors – that it at once expands our ability to connect and explore but also more deeply contracts freedom – is mirrored in neoliberalism at large. On the one hand, we are offered a world of consumer choice and seemingly boundless interactions. On the other, however, we are ensnared by debt that forecloses the future, autonomy and dignity is undercut by technologies that reshape work and culture, and inequality veers towards the oligarchic. And in communities, workplaces and households across the country, people lack meaningful control over their lives as neoliberalism has hollowed out institutions of collective control and excavated sites of democratic power in the economy.","How then can we resist the unfreedom of neoliberalism amid the conditions of data accumulation and monopolistic platforms? If neoliberalism is, as Will Davies argues, ‘the disenchantment of politics by economics’, our response must be to rebuild democratic power and our capacity to shape and order our lives. This requires a politics that emphasises the need for granularity and friction, not endless smooth accumulation, that stresses the importance of publicness and public things, and is sceptical about the emancipatory claims of technology while working towards a world where such rhetoric can find actualisation in meaningful and democratic forms. While lessons from past battles with the monopolies of industrial capitalism suggest potential tools of regulation, anti-trust action, or prohibition to challenge surveillance capitalism, it is more likely we will need to develop a new 21st century framework for building a democratic digital infrastructure.","Concretely, it demands new models of ownership and governance – of our data and of capital – that can democratise the economy at scale alongside the more innovative use of existing public institutions such as the BBC and its digital reach. The reimagining of the mechanisms by which surveillance produces profit must be central to this. This should include reframing how behaviour data is captured, stored and used, challenging the concentrated nature of the contemporary means of production in the dominant platforms, and reshaping who benefits from data’s potential monetisation, reinserting our collective claim to the value we create.","There is much to do then, and little time. Surveillance capitalism is universal in intent, aiming for all encompassing oversight and behavioural influence. The ambition of the platforms giants is insatiable and their influence, as the revelations show, often pernicious. We should beware Californians bearing gifts. All is not lost though. As the late Robin Murray rightly argued, the same technologies underpinning current forms of neoliberal control can enable new modes of co-operation and democratic power if we have the ambition, strategy, and politics to transform their use. That then is the task: to replace the narrow and unequal choices of the society of the ‘Like’ with a deeper, more enriching and messier democratic life, where technologies deepen and extend human freedom.","Mathew Lawrence is a senior research fellow at IPPR.

(It also fails to learn that it has failed to control it.)","The rest is noise, as far as I’m concerned. Even if anyone really believes that sharing data about users is not the Facebook business model, who cares what its business model is? Whatever plausible sounding business model it had before didn’t protect anyone, and didn’t stop these characters from collecting and using data in all sorts of shady ways.","Of course there’s the strong possibility that Cambridge Analytica and others misused the data, didn’t delete it as promised, performed unsanctioned analyses on it. Oh no! Who would have thought someone would do that? The real question was what was Facebook expecting when it handed out data on millions essentially on the honor system?","Facebook’s business model is monetizing your data (the data you give it, it must be said), one way or the other.

Before I do, I can say - on the surface it’s plausible that Facebook is a bit the victim here, relative to misuse of data they granted access to.","Aside then from the specifics, the Cambridge Analytica episode does shine a light on a few online privacy issues.","“We are the Product”. This on it’s own is a bit of a controversial issue - one I’ve written about a few times in the past. In general, it’s been asserted that if you are not paying for the online service, you are not the “customer”, you are the “product”. This is to mean that you are in essence trading your personal data in exchange for the free app or website service you are using.","Nothing about that premise is wrong - so long as there is a really transparent understanding between the user and the service about this exchange. Site operators like Facebook should make every effort to make it clear what data they collect, how they use it, and who they share it with. Data Privacy laws, in particular in the EU, have long been driving frameworks of consumer notice, choice and transparency.","Any online service operator - Facebook in this case - as data collectors, have a responsibility to take due care with their partners, vendors and any third-parties that they exchange and share user data with. It appears that this may be what is at issue with Cambridge Analytica.","So, is Facebook directly conspiring to allow such misuse of data to occur? Probably not - but we’ll see I guess. Are they simply needing to do more to better police the data sharing relationships they have in place with regard to their user data? They probably already do a lot, but this may prove out that it’s not enough.","One thing is clear to me, global-scale online services like Facebook (with over 1.15 Billion daily mobile users ! ) possibly have a greater responsibility to take greater care than most. At such scale, Facebook is more akin to a public utility (a worldwide operation) and for all the positive good effects that come of the service its’ users enjoy daily, the impacts of misuse can be significant."],"isopubdate":""}

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus, File)","Share story","NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook “likes” can tell a lot about a person. Maybe even enough to fuel a voter-manipulation effort like the one a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm stands accused of — and which Facebook may have enabled.","The social network is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections.","Monday was a wild roller coaster ride for Facebook, whose shares plunged 7 percent in its worst one-day decline since 2014. Officials in the EU and the U.S. sought answers, while Britain’s information commissioner said she will seek a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica’s servers because the British firm had been “uncooperative” in her investigation. The first casualty of that investigation was an audit of Cambridge that Facebook had announced earlier in the day; the company said it “stood down” that effort at the request of British officials.","Related stories","Adding to the turmoil, the New York Times reported that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will step down by August following clashes over how aggressively Facebook should address its role in spreading disinformation. In a tweet , Stamos said he’s still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed.","It would have been quieter had Facebook likes not turned out to be so revealing. Researchers in a 2013 study found that likes on hobbies, interests and other attributes can predict personal attributes such as sexual orientation and political affiliation. Computers analyze such data to look for patterns that might not be obvious, such as a link between a preference for curly fries and higher intelligence.","Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, said the firm used such techniques to learn about individuals and create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. In doing so, he said, the firm “took fake news to the next level.”","“This is based on an idea called ‘informational dominance,’ which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what’s actually happening,” Wylie said Monday on NBC’s “Today.” It’s not yet clear exactly how the firm might have attempted to do that.","Late Friday, Facebook said Cambridge improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded an app described as a personality test. Those people agreed to share data with the app for research — not for political targeting. And the data included who their Facebook friends were and what they liked — even though those friends hadn’t downloaded the app or given explicit consent.","Cambridge got limited information on the friends, but machines can use detailed answers from smaller groups to make good inferences on the rest, said Kenneth Sanford of the data science company Dataiku.","Cambridge was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, and at one point employed Stephen Bannon — later President Donald Trump’s campaign chairman and White House adviser — as a vice president. The Trump campaign paid Cambridge roughly $6 million according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work.","The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common, but is typically used to sell diapers and other products. Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person’s viewing behaviors fit with what other customers watch.","But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it’s connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media.","Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to “explore mental vulnerabilities of people.” He said the firm “works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.”","Wylie told “Today” that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge effort aimed to make sure people wouldn’t know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.","The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge’s data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing, and says it didn’t retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn’t use it in its 2016 campaign work.","Yet Cambridge boasted of its work after another client, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, won the Iowa caucus in 2016.","Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz from similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use.","Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages. For voters who care about tradition, it could push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might have described keeping guns for protection against crime.","It’s possible that Cambridge tapped other data sources, including what Cruz’s campaign app collected. Nix said during the Cruz campaign that it had five or six sources of data on each voter.","Facebook declined to provide officials for interview and didn’t immediately respond to requests for information beyond its statements Friday and Monday. Cambridge also didn’t immediately respond to emailed questions.","Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. Facebook’s mapping of the “social graph” — essentially the web of people’s real-life connections — is also invaluable for marketers.","For example, researchers can look at people’s clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. People who bridge different friend networks, for example, can have more influence when they post something, making them prime for targeting.","Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according on Pew Research Center. While people don’t exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the “rabbit hole” of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described.","___","An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the sum paid by the 2016 Trump campaign to Cambridge Analytica. It was $5.9 million according to federal election records."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

How much data am I sharing with the social media giant? Did I really give permission for it to be collected and stored?","And, even more seriously, have I handed over my friends' data to be stored on some Californian server?","I am one of those people and what I've discovered has left me somewhat shocked. Over the weekend I got hold of my Facebook data. It's easy enough, you go to settings, then general account settings and click on download my data.","An hour or so later an email arrived with a link to click and I was downloading a 675MB folder chronicling all of my life on the network since I signed up in 2007.","Big numbers","At first sight there was nothing very troubling - I would expect all the photos and videos I'd ever posted to be there, and scrolling down my timeline provided an entertaining glimpse of my life over the last decade.","I did notice that for some years every song I'd listened to on Spotify was listed, a handy reminder that when you link any external app to Facebook it then gathers a lot more data about you.","But then I clicked on a file called contacts. I was taken aback to find my entire contact list, thousands of phone numbers. Now this was not limited to Facebook friends and included many people in the public eye who might be disturbed to find that their private numbers were stored in this way.","I cannot remember what happened when I set up my Facebook account back in 2007 - in those naive days I could well have clicked yes when invited to upload my contacts so that I could see who else was part of this new young community. So, my fault I suppose.","Then I noticed that at the top of the list were some numbers that cannot have been sucked into the Facebook machine a decade ago because I had only added them in recent weeks. They included, ironically, the mobile number of Carole Cadwalladr, the journalist who has blown open the whole story of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.","So this means that every time I enter a new number into my phone's database, it somehow ends up with Facebook - the company is in effect monitoring me.","This is not the most startling example of Facebook's data collection. At least one user has reported that all of his text messages from an Android phone have somehow ended up being stored by Mark Zuckerberg's company.","Even if Facebook users agree to share this data, their friends whose numbers or text messages are being collected almost certainly have not. And even if those people have never joined Facebook - or have decided to delete their accounts - it looks as though some of their data will stay with the social network as long as the people who provided it remain.","Facebook says that uploading your contacts is a normal part of signing up with many messaging or social apps - and insists that users are given a clear choice.","People are expressly asked if they want to give permission to upload their contacts from their phone - it's explained right there in the apps when you get started. People can delete previously uploaded information at any time.","The company is right to say this is common practice. And if you think it is creepy that Facebook is storing this information, what about Apple's iCloud where millions store their iPhone data, including their contacts?","In any case, Facebook insists it never shares this data with anyone else. The problem is that its business model, unlike Apple's, depends on exploiting its users' data. And given what they have learned over the last week about how that information may have been used, many Facebook users may not be inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt."],"isopubdate":""}

Then they used this data to help the Trump and Brexit campaigns psychologically manipulate voters through targeted ads. The result was Vote Leave ‘won’ the UK’s Brexit referendum and Trump was elected president in the US.","Unfortunately, almost everything in the above summary is false or misleading.","First, There was no hack.","The data collected was scraped from Facebook user profiles, after users granted permission for a third party app to access their data. You know those little confirmation windows that pop up when someone wants to play Candy Crush or use Facebook to log in, rather than make a new password, for a random site? Yeah those.","A Cambridge academic called Aleksandr Kogan — NOT Cambridge Analytica and NOT the whistleblower Christopher Wylie — made a ‘Test Your Personality’ app, helped to promote it by paying people $2–4 to install it on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site, and used the permissions granted to harvest profile data. 270,000 users installed the app, so you might expect that 270,000 profiles were collected but the app actually collected data from 50 million profiles.","50 million?!?","Yes. You see back in the heady days of 2014, Facebook had a feature called ‘friends permission’ that allowed developers to access the profiles of not only the person who installed their app but all their friends too. The only way to prevent this from happening was to have toggled a privacy setting, which few Facebook users even knew existed (here is a blog from 2012 explaining how to do so). The friends permission feature is how Kogan multiplied 270,000 permissions into 50 million profiles worth of data.","That Facebook users were having their data shared by their friends without their knowledge or permission was a serious concern that many privacy advocates noted at the time. So in 2015, facing growing criticism and pressure, Facebook removed the feature citing a desire to give their users “more control”. This decision caused consternation amongst developers as the ability to access friends profiles was extremely popular (see the comments under this 2014 post from Facebook announcing the changes). Sandy Parakilas, an ex-Facebook manager, reported to Bloomberg that “tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers” were making use of the feature before it was discontinued.","To review, there are two key points to remember at this point:","None of what I just described involves ‘hacking’ Facebook or exploiting a bug. Instead, it all revolves around the use of a feature that Facebook provided to all developers and (at least) tens of thousands took advantage of.","The data collected was not internal Facebook data. It was data that developers (s̵c̵r̵a̵p̵e̵d̵ ) accessed* from the profiles of people who downloaded their apps (and their friends). Facebook has a lot more data on users than is publically available and it has it for everyone who uses their platform. No one but Facebook has access to that data. This is a point that almost all the journalists involved seem unable to grasp, instead they repeatedly equate ‘Facebook’s internal data’ to ‘data (s̵c̵r̵a̵p̵e̵d̵ )accessed from Facebook profiles using a third party app’. But these are VERY different things.(*changed term as per convincing suggestion provided in the responses.)","The importance of this second point becomes apparent when you read exchanges like this one:","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.","This exchange is being reported as evidence that Facebook lied to politicians about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. But when you understand the difference between Facebook’s internal data and data collected on Facebook by outside developers it is clear that what Facebook’s policy director is saying is very likely true.","So where does Cambridge Analytica come in to the story?","Well, they paid Kogan to collect those 50 million profiles. Whose idea that was originally is currently a matter of ‘he said, she said’. Kogan says Cambridge Analytica approached him and Cambridge Analytica says Kogan came to them. Whatever the case may be, this is the part of the story where there was an actual breach; not of Facebook’s internal data but of Facebook’s data sharing policies. Developers were permitted to collect all the user data they wanted from their apps, but what they were not allowed to do — even back in 2014 — was take that data and sell it to a third party.","The fact that there were (at minimum) tens of thousands of developers with access to such information meant that it was inevitable that data harvested on Facebook was being sold, or otherwise provided, to a wide array of third parties. Again, the disgruntled ex Facebook manager confirmed as much:","Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on. Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers.","So given how prevalent Facebook data harvesting was and that there are many developers with more than 270,000 users to harvest from, why is Cambridge Analytica receiving so much media attention?","The answer to this seems to primarily be how journalists, particularly Carole Cadwalladr at the Observer, have framed the story. The majority of coverage has pushed two angles. First, that a whistleblower from Cambridge Analytica revealed ‘a major breach’ of Facebook’s data, an issue covered above, and second, that this ‘breach’ was linked to the success of Trump’s presidential campaign.","Chris Wylie the mastermind who ‘hacked’ Facebook…","This second angle is as dubious as the first and relies heavily on bombastic claims made by Chris Wylie—the pink haired ex-Cambridge Analytica employee pictured above. Carole Cadwalladr, who spent years on the story, has explained in various interviews that she approached the story not as an investigative journalist but as a features writer. This meant that she focused on delving into ‘the human side of the story’, or put another way- Chris Wylie. There are pros and cons to such an approach but the biggest drawback is how invested and reliant it made her and subsequent coverage in accepting Wylie’s narrative, which just so happens to paint him as a young mastermind at the center of global political conspiracies.","Cadwalladr fully endorses Wylie’s presentation and fawningly describes him as: “clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling” … “impossibly young” … “His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible” … “Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time” … “when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something — his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead — it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold” … “his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great BritishBake Off.”","Wow… what a guy.","Cadwalladr’s person-focused approach might make for more accessible articles but it also helps to obscure the relevant technical details in favour of providing sensationalist quotes and personal anecdotes from Wylie and his friends and coworkers. Presenting these kinds of details could be insightful, if they were subjected to sufficient critical examination but this rarely occurs. Cadwalladr, instead, seems to have entirely bought into Wylie’s narrative: “by the time I met him in person, I’d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time.”","So let’s address the oversight and take a bit more of a critical look at what Wylie’s narrative claims:","That Cambridge Analytica claims to be able to provide effective tools for psychological targeting and manipulation… Certainly true.","That Chris Wylie, himself, was involved with some shady business and views himself as partly responsible… Sure.","That the self-promotional claims of Cambridge Analytica actually equate to how effective the services they provide are… Hmmmm.","This last point is the most important and yet it is also the one lacking almost any supporting evidence.","The temptation might be to point to Trump’s surprising victory but there are a lot of confounding factors there. Trump won, yes. But he won against the most unpopular Democratic candidate in modern history, who was vying for a third Democratic term (something which had not been achieved since the 1940s). Furthermore, he won by a very slim margin and actually lost the popular vote.","Could all that just be evidence of how precise Cambridge Analytica’s psychological targeting was? Maybe, but we start to run into the perils of dealing with an unfalsifiable hypothesis. A better approach would be to look at Cambridge Analytica’s relative record of success and failure. Unfortunately, we do not have access to their full client list but we do know that when they first rose to prominence they were working for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. That’s right, Ted Cruz — the Republican senator who was crushed by Trump in the Republican primaries, despite having the power of Cambridge Analytica at his command. I am not the first to notice this apparent contradiction, Martin Robbins made the same point on Little Atoms last year:","So the story of the Republican primaries is actually that Cambridge Analytica’s flashy data science team got beaten by a dude with a thousand-dollar website. To turn that into this breathtaking story of an unbeatable voodoo-science outfit, powering Trump inexorably to victory, is quite a stretch. Who else have they even worked for? Without a list of clients it’s very easy to cherry-pick the winners.","The techniques that Cambridge Analytica purport to use involve using social network data to build algorithms that can accurately predict what kind of messages will be effective given an individual’s personality and psychology. This is what the stories mean when they talk about using psychographics to micro-target voters. But a lot of the claims being made about the effectiveness of such techniques is widely exaggerated. Kogan — the Cambridge academic at the heart of the controversy — has made similar arguments. He claims that he is being scapegoated and argues that the personality profiles he gathered turned out to not be particularly useful for making the predictions needed for micro-targeting:","In fact, from our subsequent research on the topic,” he wrote, “we found out that the predictions we gave SCL were 6 times more likely to get all 5 of a person’s personality traits wrong as it was to get them all correct. In short, even if the data was used by a campaign for micro-targeting, it could realistically only hurt their efforts.","Kogan is hardly an impartial source but his claim accords with various studies that have shown less than stellar results for nefarious social media manipulation. Take, for instance, the controversial Facebook ‘mind control’ study, which I’ve heard several journalists reference in recent days. What always seems to be missing from reporting on this study is just how underwhelming it was.","Facebook ran an experiment on almost 689,000 users in which it tweaked the algorithm running their news feed to display slightly more or slightly less status updates from friends that contained positive or negative words. As any researcher knows, with such a large sample you are guaranteed to find statistically significant differences between groups. A more important criteria with such massive groups is how large the effect observed was. In the Facebook study this equated to a truly terrifying difference: those who saw less negative updates used around 0.05 more positive words out of every 100 words in their status updates, whereas those who saw less positive updates used around 1 less positive word per 100 in their status updates. That’s right Facebook might have been able to manipulate people to use around 1 less positive word for every 100 words in their updates. It would be wrong to paint this as Facebook being powerless, bigger interventions would have bigger effects, but it is important to keep things in perspective.","Note the starting point of the y-axis. There is a reason it isn’t 0.","The real story then is not that Kogan, Wylie, and Cambridge Analytica developed some incredibly high tech ‘hack’ of Facebook. It is that, aside from Kogan’s data selling, they used methods that were common place and permitted by Facebook prior to 2015. Cambridge Analytica has since the story broke been outed as a rather obnoxious, unethical company- at least in how it promotes itself to potential clients. But the majority of what is being reported in the media about its manipulative power is just an uncritical regurgitation of Cambridge Analytica (and Chris Wylie’s) self-promotional claims. The problem is that there is little evidence that the company can do what it claims and plenty of evidence that it is not as effective as it likes to pretend; see the fact that Ted Cruz is not currently president.","No one is totally immune to marketing or political messaging but there is little evidence that Cambridge Analytica is better than other similar PR or political canvassing companies at targeting voters. Political targeting and disinformation campaigns, including those promoted by Russia, certainly had an impact on recent elections but were they the critical factor? Did they have a bigger impact than Comey announcing he was ‘reopening’ the Hillary email investigation the week before the US election? Or Brexiteers claiming that £250 million was being stolen from the NHS by the EU every week? Colour me skeptical.","To be crystal clear, I’m not arguing that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan were innocent. At the very least, it is clear they were doing things that were contrary to Facebook’s data sharing policies. And similarly Facebook seems to have been altogether too cavalier with permitting developers to access its users’ private data.","What I am arguing is that Cambridge Analytica are not the puppet masters they are being widely portrayed as. If anything they are much more akin to Donald Trump; making widely exaggerated claims about their abilities and getting lots of attention as a result.","***I added a follow up piece to clarify some of my positions and address some of the common criticisms I saw, you can find it here.","*****************************************************************You can find me talking about similar stuff on twitter: @C_Kavanagh"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-26"}

And his answer to me was: 'Can I answer you with a question? If you were me, would you?'\"","Thirteen months later, Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act. Instead, he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name. It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook's flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself.","\"The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do,\" Zuckerberg wrote in January, laying out the \"personal challenge\" that he sets for himself each year.","In 2017, the billionaire challenged himself to travel to every state he'd never visited. This year, long after critics began demanding an overhaul, Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to \"fix\" the platform that he has engineered to build community — but that is increasingly blamed for warping it.","Yet things continue to get worse. Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users — possibly used to aid Donald Trump's campaign — and that the social network has been collecting Android users' phone call and text message histories without notice. That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information.","On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices.","Throughout the mounting crisis, Zuckerberg's response has been a study in contradictions. He crisscrossed the country, even as his company back home came under increasing fire. He preaches transparency, but flinches at questioning and craves privacy. He is undeniably brilliant, but stubborn in his reluctance to acknowledge the extent of Facebook's problems.","Even his critics say he is uniquely capable of righting the ship. But at 33, is he prepared to do all it will take?","\"If he fails to do it, it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel,\" said Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become one of the company's most pointed critics.","\"I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time,\" McNamee said. \"I think it's really hard to make that case today.\"","___","Days after Trump's election, Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters.","\"The idea that fake news on Facebook ... influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,\" the CEO told the audience at a California technology conference.","\"I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was,\" said David Kirkpatrick, the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day. \"You can certainly say that he was culpable, in that he was naive and inattentive to what was happening in his system. But I don't think he was lying.\"","Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after, continuing a years-long routine of self-correction. But errors that reflect his stubbornness, those who know him say, are tempered by an eagerness to learn from mistakes and a deep sense of reflection.","Donald Graham, the former chairman of the Washington Post Co., recalled that when he met Zuckerberg in 2005, outsiders still weren't sure what to make of Facebook.","\"I would ask him a question and he would pause long enough — 15 seconds, 20 seconds — that I would think 'Did I insult him? Did he not hear me?'\" said Graham, who went on to serve on the company's board from 2008 to 2015.","\"Since I am from Washington, I'm not used to people thinking before they are answering a question. ... But Mark, then as now, was thinking about the right answer.\"","Zuckerberg's boyish appearance, even today, is a reminder of just how young he was when he created what would become the world's biggest social network, back in his dorm room at Harvard.","\"I didn't know anything about building a company or global internet service,\" he wrote in January. \"Over the years I've made almost every mistake you can imagine.\"","Naomi Gleit, Facebook's longest-serving employee after the CEO, said Zuckerberg — who declined an interview request from The Associated Press — has been talking about making the world a better place since he was 21. But his view of that world and his place in it \"seemed almost like a gravity, a burden of responsibility,\" she said.","That seriousness coincides with a sense of certainty.","Gleit recalled Zuckerberg's steadfast attachment to a Facebook message service similar to email, even as more people began using phones to send text messages. But co-workers eventually swayed the CEO, who she described as a \"learn-it-all.\" That change-of-mind informed Facebook's 2014 purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service for $19 billion.","\"I think he would even say now that he was initially wrong,\" Gleit said.","With Zuckerberg, \"its experiment, learn, experiment, learn,\" said LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who has known him since 2004. Hoffman said that is evident in Zuckerberg's enthusiasm for software, which can be overwritten to fix problems. That facility, he said, makes Zuckerberg the equal of executives with far more experience.","But in the process of learning, Zuckerberg's inexperience has sometimes played out in public view.","___","In 2010, Zuckerberg announced on Oprah Winfrey's television show that he would donate $100 million to schools in Newark, New Jersey.","Critics labeled it an attempt to polish his image, just as the biopic \"The Social Network\" was being released. Still, there was little questioning his generosity. The problem was that Zuckerberg — who knew little about education — made the gift with few specifics outlining how it should be spent.","\"He was just a very young, naive, inexperienced guy who was brilliant at technology and computers and the internet, but just really didn't know much about how the world worked,\" said Dale Russakoff, author of \"The Prize,\" a book chronicling how the money went to high-priced consultants, with minimal effort by leaders to build community support.","By the end of the process, Zuckerberg had developed a clearer understanding of how to get things done. He and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, have since chartered their own foundation and structured it to take on mammoth goals, like a $3 billion investment to cure, prevent or manage all diseases. He has pledged to donate 99 percent of his Facebook stock to philanthropy.","\"Zuck's maturation has occurred in front of the public,\" said Kirkpatrick, author of \"The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company that Is Connecting the World.\" ''But he also still lives with the consequences of the decisions he made when he was less mature.\"","At Facebook, Zuckerberg has grown increasingly bold in using huge sums of money to pursue corporate goals, which includes purchasing competitors — or companies that could grow into competitors.","Facebook's $1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012 — then unprofitable and little-known — came as a shock to Wall Street. Two years later came the multibillion-dollar deal to buy WhatsApp, a company that remains unprofitable but has given Facebook a prime portal into developing countries and other regions outside the U.S.","In 2014, soon after Facebook bought a virtual reality firm called Oculus, Zuckerberg found himself being grilled in a lawsuit brought by a competitor who accused an Oculus executive of stealing trade secrets. Under questioning, he talked about the pressure he exerted to make the Oculus deal happen, and his vision of growing it so fast \"that we can get every developer and studio in the world building just for Oculus before any big competitor exists.\"","Last year, in a bid to free up his fortune for philanthropy, Zuckerberg pushed board members to restructure Facebook's stock, allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control. That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors' stakes. Days before Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify as part of the suit, the company dropped the plan.","The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg, who advocates for transparency and the interests of the community but whose individual interests don't always align.","The paradox is self-inflicted, the trade-off for creating a venture premised on users' willingness to share details of their lives. That requires Zuckerberg, who has 105 million Facebook \"friends,\" to reveal far more about himself than would be expected of any other CEO, whether its photos of him and Chan baking sweets for the Jewish holiday of Purim or dressing their daughters for the Chinese New Year.","Yet he fiercely guards his privacy.","When calls went out last year for Zuckerberg to testify before a Senate committee, the company sent its lawyer. And when he and Chan bought 700 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last year, they quietly filed lawsuits against hundreds of Hawaiians — withdrawn after protests — that would have cut off locals' access to the land by negating their interest in small ancestral tracts within the estate's boundaries.","Facebook works hard to present Zuckerberg as someone deeply interested in the ordinary people whose lives are at the heart of its business.","Stops on last year's U.S. tour, never announced, were set up by facilitators who revealed details to only a select few. But many of the visits were covered by the media and documented in professional-quality photos on Zuckerberg's Facebook page soon after he'd departed.","Ostensibly, the idea was for Zuckerberg to learn. But in their brief interactions, many people were just as interested in finding a way to connect with him.","In Hazard, Kentucky, educator Paul Green became custodian of the small town's biggest secret. A staffer from Zuckerberg's foundation, peppering Green with questions about the region's educational cooperative, finally admitted it was because the CEO himself wanted to visit. Green's reward for keeping it quiet was seeing the wide-eyed grins when Zuckerberg pulled up and greeted local high schoolers studying robotics and programming.","Walking through science demonstrations, Zuckerberg spent more time trading tech tales with the teenagers than quizzing the teachers.","\"He just lit up with those kids,\" Green said. \"The way he talked with them about some of the things he did when he was in school and his passion for technology, it really was cool.\"","When Zuckerberg toured an oil rig near Williston, North Dakota, last July, \"from the minute he got out of the car to the minute he got back in the car, he was nothing but questions,\" said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, which arranged the visit.","\"I had Bakken shale, limestone, dolomite, and he was able to hold them in his hand, along with a bottle of crude oil. And I remember him asking, 'How do you get that oil out of that rock?'\" geologist Kathleen Neset said.","In Dayton, Ohio, Zuckerberg met with officials, caregivers and families battling drug addiction. Lori Erion, the founder of the group Families of Addicts, said she told him what it was like to learn her daughter, April, had shot up heroin in their own home.","\"It seemed to get him really emotional,\" Erion said, recalling how Zuckerberg stood up suddenly and told the group he needed a few minutes to steady himself. When he returned, he asked what makes an addict stay clean and how families got their loved ones into treatment.","\"We didn't ever talk about Facebook at all,\" Erion said, \"which is really interesting because Facebook is really the main way of us getting information out. He really was just like a regular person.\"","___","As Zuckerberg connected with Americans face-to-face, controversy over Facebook continued to spiral.","Shortly before the election, McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, warning that Facebook was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended. It wasn't just about the U.S. election: A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments, and critics had detected a well-organized, clandestine campaign supporting Brexit.","All this pointed to a deep problem with Facebook — that it was simply not equipped or not willing to prevent the misuse of its platform.","McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since.","Facebook has adopted this \"libertarian philosophy that says 'we are not responsible for anything downstream, we are allowed to disrupt media, we are allowed to addict our users and we are not responsible for any of the consequences of any of that,'\" he said.","Zuckerberg could change that. But McNamee said it is not enough to hire thousands of workers to weed through fake and abusive posts if those posts keep getting through. And tweaking Facebook's newsfeed so users see more posts from families and friends does not address his certainty that the algorithms underlying Facebook make it dangerously addictive.","\"You cannot cure addiction by doing more of the thing that got you addicted in the first place, which is what Zuck recommends,\" McNamee wrote in an email.","Critics say Facebook continues to ignore the possibility of the social network being used for dark purposes, but Zuckerberg's supporters counter that he is unfairly blamed for problems he could not have foreseen.","Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, credits Zuckerberg with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset, making changes that will nudge users into a more positive virtual environment — without completely shutting out inflammatory content.","\"Facebook basically is saying we enable people based on the way they behave. That's a very democratic argument. If people want to live in filter bubbles, who are we to say 'Don't live in filter bubbles,' even though we don't want them to?\" Hoffman said.","But Kirkpatrick argued that Zuckerberg's and Sandberg's surety that Facebook has a positive impact on society has blinded them to parallel realities. The company can't be fixed, Kirkpatrick said, until Zuckerberg comes to terms with existential threats to the way the social network does business — its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users.","\"There's no question in my mind that Mark Zuckerberg is an ethical and responsible human being who wants to do the right thing,\" he said. \"However, I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world. And I also don't think he realizes the extent to which that really is true.\"","McNamee, recalling Zuckerberg as a 22-year-old visionary, said the CEO must be willing to rethink long-held assumptions. But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community.","\"You've won,\" McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel.","\"You've achieved more than your wildest dreams. You're a billionaire. Now you have a chance to be a hero.\""],"isopubdate":""}

And when Kogan passed on their data to Cambridge Analytica, he violated platform policies against sharing information with a third party.","Facebook says it learned about what happened in 2015 and removed the app, then demanded Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and SCL destroy the data. Facebook says it was assured by each entity the data was gone.","Now Facebook says it recently learned those assurances may have been false.","\"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" Facebook Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement Friday. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.\"","Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing.","In its own statement, it concedes it contracted with and received data from Global Science Research, a company led by Kogan, but says that when it learned that the user information was not obtained in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted all of it.","Cambridge Analytica says it is committed to receiving information in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act \"and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\"","To what extent the Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica were intertwined remains murky.","Billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer, who donated to the Trump campaign, backs Cambridge Analytica, having invested millions of dollars in the company. And Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon sat on its board, even naming the company, according The New York Times.","According to the newspaper, \"the firm was effectively a shell\" based in the U.K. and run by foreigners whose contracts with American campaigns — including that of presidential hopeful Ted Cruz — possibly violated Federal Election Commission rules. (The Times interviewed Wylie, who has since left the company and runs another firm.)","The Trump campaign says it briefly used Cambridge Analytica for TV ads and paid some of its data employees, according to The Associated Press.","But congressional investigators have questioned CEO Alexander Nix about the company's role in the campaign.","Nix said last fall that the firm reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the runup to the election to request emails connected to the Hillary Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks said no. It was around the same time that Cambridge began working for the Trump campaign, reports The Wall Street Journal.","The Journal also reports that the firm has become ensnared in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.","And yet as the firm sought to build \"psychographic profiles\" to help discern whom Internet users are and how political messaging might be tailored to them, it turned to Kogan, the Cambridge University psychology professor. The Times says Kogan created the app using a technique developed at the school's Psychometrics Centre, which is designed to map personality traits based Facebook likes. Kogan then put the app on Facebook under the false pretense of using it for academic purposes.","All told, the Times says Kogan handed over more than 50 million profiles to Cambridge Analytica, including information from app users' friends — who had never consented to forgoing their data. Around 30 million of those profiles contained enough information to build psychographic profiles, the newspaper says.","The firm said in its statement, \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\"","Facebook says it will take legal action if it finds something unlawful occurred."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

So do you know about the scandal and its background? Well you would if you listened to The Corbett Report. Here’s the backstory.","I also recently watched a Bombard’s Body Language video in which the Zuck android was being interviewed about this very topic. He is very concerned. About his revenue. Because one can never have too much money apparently. People assume that evil is winning because we hear about them being exposed so much, which doesn’t make any sense when you think about it. Being exposed is what they fear because it precedes their demise. JimBob from fluorida where he remains a simple country boy who stays in shape by outrunning the zombies in latex.","The Zuck is in a special club right now: I like to call it “The best paid agents” – and he is on a very high place (although the official king of the bill being Jeff Bezos right now).","All of those club members apparently have special fields of expertise.","Like Bill Gates happily injecting poor children in the third world with stuff that may or may not kill them. And he still isn’t on the Interpol list of wanted criminals…","Like George Soros fostering dissent via his “philantropic operations” to pump as many North African migrants into Europe – and Rothschild-operated migration (concentration) camps in Italy, for example…","Like Jeff Bezos, willfully providing propaganda for the Pentagon and supplying the CIA/MIIC with infos what people buy on Amazon and his shit show flea market called “Amazon market places” (with his newest endeavours of getting into the food market, banking and mortgage sector…).","Yeah, the Zuck is in great company and he will try everything to stay in that club of willful agents.","Money is very important to people who can’t have enough of it. That is a very special club.

True, he is in a special club, but that is mostly the billionaire club. However, it is undoubtedly not a single issue concern. But in this case he is definitely worried and it seems to me to be mostly financial worry. JimBob from fluorida where the sun always shines in the PR slides.","Oh – he is most definitely worried! Because he knows how quickly his outfit can crash and burn.\nAnd with this his entire future (remember talks about him being eventually a US president?) is in jeopardy right now.","So of course he is actually *desperate*!","But he could’ve cashed out earlier and live on a bought island and be done with it.\nBut he thought he is unstoppable and now he experiences his *first* major bump in the road…","Most of his money is probably in FB stock as well. So if his business plummets, so does his wealth. He’s also really unable to handle person to person interactions. Typical techie in that regard, so the idea of an actual physical (not violent, but just face to face) confrontation probably terrifies him. Especially with the idea of him personally facing an accuser, such as the congress, just freaks him out. I almost feel sorry for techies, as they generally do so poorly in normal human interactions, but it was their choice to run and hide from them. In his case though, he is a con artist who is also a super-techie. So, I’m ecstatic that he may now have to do more controversial (in his mind) encounters with people in order to placate his mindless followers.","At least all of them who got really rich (triple digit millionaires and upwards) by “themselves” have sold out.","Hence my “best paid agents”-comment above.","The only “clean” rich could be – at least theoretically – the ones who inherited their wealth.","But the moment they get their wealth the clock ticks into the other direction – against everything that is social, to keep their wealth.","The ultra rich – the ones that *don’t* appear on the Forbes list – only get richer. They are practically untouchable.","The CLEVER ultra rich (Rockefellers, Rothschilds) don’t allow individual family members to lose that wealth anyway.\nMembers get the best starting positions in life and generous “pocket money” (which still brings them into the 0.01%) but regular inheritance laws don’t really apply to them (if they still exist).\nAnd while some famous “playboys” were known they never were able to lose the family fortune.","I’m not an expert on foundations but one thing is clear: The more you find the more you are on the right track…","Perhaps he wasn’t all too happy with the state of things and got “suicided”?","If we ignore the Protocols of Zion (propaganda) and satanist (faith and anti-faith are only for the gullible) crap in the article and stay with the factoids presented there then the timing of the murder is probably the biggest clue.","Who knows?

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of people’s relationships and preferences.","Cambridge Analytica — unlike other firms that access Facebook’s user data — broke Facebook’s rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebook’s systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social network’s information trove were so loose in the first place.","Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebook’s data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, “likes” and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebook’s popular “log-in through Facebook” feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the user’s Facebook friends, developers said.","Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didn’t misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developers’ databases in perpetuity.","Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers.","The question of what Facebook permitted — and how everyday users understood those permissions — is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group.","On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately.","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service.”","Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings — after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian ma­nipu­la­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election.","“While Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect people’s information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect people’s private information,” Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.","A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing.","Facebook’s shares closed down 6.8 percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks.","Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called Thisis­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million “friends,” the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported.","“Facebook made it easy for app developers to collect users’ friends’ data,” said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook users’ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists.","Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information.","“The model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,” said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developers’ privacy practices until 2012. “Protecting users did not fit into that.” Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures.","The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the company’s data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, “This app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friends’s birthdays, photos, and likes.”","But two former FTC officials said that Facebook’s allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a person’s friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency.","Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50 million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment.","Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,” Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. “We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, “that in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.”","Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. “FTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info — now a hollow promise,” Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.","Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, “We’ve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.” That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friends’ data were used by third parties.","Facebook “goes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,” said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. “No one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. It’s entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.”","Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices.","In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebook’s log-in button to sign on to the campaign’s website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friends’ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of people’s relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote.","“We ingested the entire U.S. social graph,” Davidsen said in an interview. “We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.”","FarmVille’s developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

I fell hard for William F. Buckley as a teenager and my first job was as editorial assistant at Buckley’s National Review, followed by stints writing speeches for first lady Nancy Reagan and then working for the Gipper himself. Looking toward the 1988 race, Vice President George H.W. Bush wasn’t conservative enough for me. I went to work as a speechwriter for Representative Jack Kemp in 1986.","So you’d think that the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, would be a natural fit. It once was. But on Saturday, after speaking to this year’s gathering, I had to be escorted from the premises by several guards who seemed genuinely concerned for my safety.","What happened to me at CPAC is the perfect illustration of the collective experience of a whole swath of conservatives since Donald Trump became the Republican nominee. We built and organized this party — but now we’re made to feel like interlopers.","I was surprised that I was even asked to speak at CPAC. My views on Trump, Roy Moore and Steve Bannon are no secret. I knew the crowd would be hostile, and so I was tempted to pass.","But too many of us have given up the fight. We’ve let disgust and dismay lead us to withdraw while bad actors take control of the direction of our movement. I know how encouraged I feel whenever someone simply states the truth, and so I decided to accept CPAC’s invitation.","Like the Republican Party, CPAC has become heavily Trumpified. Last year, they invited alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos (and withdrew the invitation only after lewd tapes surfaced). This year, in addition to the president and vice president, CPAC invited Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, granddaughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen and niece of National Front leader Marine Le Pen.","Matt Schlapp, CPAC’s chairman, described her as a “classical liberal” on Twitter. This is utter nonsense. Ms. Maréchal-Le Pen is a member of the National Front party, and far from distancing herself from her Holocaust-denying, anti-Semitic and racist grandfather, she has offered him a more full-throated endorsement than her aunt has. “I am the political heir of Jean-Marie Le Pen,” Maréchal-Le Pen told the Washington Post last year. “He was a visionary. He was right about a lot of things.”","So it has come to this: a conservative group whose worst fault in years past may have been excessive flat tax enthusiasm now opens its doors to the blood and soil nationalists of Europe.","While there were reasonable, mainstream Republican speakers at CPAC, the lineup also featured demagogues like Sheriff David Clarke Jr. While he oversaw the Milwaukee County jail, one pregnant prisoner was repeatedly raped, and several prisoners died in the space of just six months. One was a mentally ill man who was denied water for seven days. No matter. The sheriff was cheered by the CPAC crowd.","My panel was about the #MeToo movement, which was a natural for me since my new book coming out in June, “Sex Matters,” grapples with the movement and other aspects of our fraught sexual ecosystem.","After every woman on the panel had a chance to speak and with 10 minutes remaining on the clock, the moderator threw a slow pitch right over the plate. She asked us about feminist hypocrisy. Ask me that at a cocktail party and I will talk your ear off about how the very people who had lectured us about the utter venality of workplace sexual harassment throughout the 1980s became suddenly quiescent when the malefactor was Bill Clinton.","But this time, and particularly in front of this crowd, it felt far more urgent to point out the hypocrisy of our side. How can conservative women hope to have any credibility on the subject of sexual harassment or relations between the sexes when they excuse the behavior of President Trump? And how can we participate in any conversation about sexual ethics when the Republican president and the Republican Party backed a man credibly accused of child molestation for the United States Senate?","I watched my fellow panelists’ eyes widen. And then the booing began.","I’d been dreading it for days, but when it came, I almost welcomed it. There is nothing more freeing than telling the truth. And it must be done, again and again, by those of us who refuse to be absorbed into this brainless, sinister, clownish thing called Trumpism, by those of us who refuse to overlook the fools, frauds and fascists attempting to glide along in his slipstream into respectability.","I spoke to a hostile audience for the sake of every person who has watched this spectacle of mendacity in disbelief and misery for the past two years. Just hearing the words you know are true can serve as ballast, steadying your mind when so much seems unreal.","For traditional conservatives, the past two years have felt like a Twilight Zone episode. Politicians, activists and intellectuals have succumbed with numbing regularity, betraying every principle they once claimed to uphold. But there remains a vigorous remnant of dissenters. I hear from them. There were even some at CPAC.","A substantial number of people applauded. And as I was hustled out of the building by security, various supporters gave me the thumbs up sign.","Just before I reached the exit, a woman approached me and called my name. “That was so brave!” she told me.","She was one of my fellow panelists. I hope she’s encouraged. I am.","Mona Charen (@monacharenEPPC) is a syndicated columnist and a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center."],"isopubdate":"2282-10-07"}

It was birthed out of a company based in London called SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories) Group, which is a military contractor that works in information operations around the world.","Cambridge Analytica is essentially the digitization of information operations whereby it harvests lots of data on people and builds algorithms that profile personality traits, political views, behaviors that you might have, takes that information and creates a web of disinformation.","It did so by misappropriating at least 50 million Facebook records.","The important thing for people to understand is that Cambridge Analytica isn’t just a normal political consultancy. Its origins are in rumor campaigns, fake news, disinformation all around the world.","What's the difference between this and how the Democrats used social media for targeting under Obama?","First of all, Obama didn't win because of disinformation.","The fundamental difference between standard political targeting and information operations is this idea of informational dominance.","The idea of informational dominance is that I inject my messaging in all the streams of information around my target so that they start to think, they start to perceive things that aren't necessarily true … And they go and behave in a particular way that I've led them to.","What Cambridge Analytica has managed to do is digitize that and make it programmatic.","What are Cambridge Analytica's links with Russia?","When I was there, we were interfacing with a company called Lukoil, which is the second-largest oil company in Russia.","We were pitching microtargeting. Fundamentally we made them aware that we were building a massive data set of private data of American citizens and psychological profiling algorithms and finding out the most impactful way to influence the minds of citizens in America.","That information then went to a very senior level of the company. This is a company that has very public links with the FSB.","At the time, I thought it was really weird that we were interfacing with this oil company, particularly when I saw (Cambridge Analytica CEO) Alexander (Nix)’s slide deck to them, which started with some of their experience in Africa, where the first slide was on rumor campaigns. The second slide was on a voter inoculation. It was on making people distrust civic institutions and the validity of elections.","In addition to that, the professor that we were engaging to run this harvesting program (Global Science Research head Aleksandr Kogan) was working at the same time on a project in Russia, funded by the Russians, on profiling psychology of people. And for me, that's really concerning.","I am not saying that … anybody knowingly colluded with Russians. But we made it pretty damn well clear to very connected Russians what the hell we were doing. What I'm saying is that the company was pretty damn reckless.","What was Steve Bannon's role in the company?","Steve was really interested in… how to change the American culture.","That's what Breitbart was originally set up to do, although Breitbart was sort of failing in expanding beyond its fairly niche segments of angry conservative men. Steve wanted a company that could build him an arsenal of weapons to engage in this sort of cultural combat that he wanted to do.","How culpable is Facebook for what happened?","Facebook is not just a social network any more. It’s a battlefield that states are going to try to operate on.","I’m not going to blame Facebook for getting caught off-guard. They’re a tech company in Silicon Valley; they don’t necessarily think about geopolitics. So I don’t blame them for that.","I think more broadly we need to have a conversation – obviously the CEO of Facebook has a very important voice in that conversation.","It sounds like you are frustrated with their response?","You can't on one hand say it's not a breach, and then on the other hand say it's a violation and we're going to investigate it because it's a very serious matter. You can't have it both ways.","The only reason Facebook is taking action is because I’ve gone public. For me, it’s frustrating to be battling a platform that I agreed to help. The people we really should be focusing on are Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon, and Cambridge Analytica.","Why are you coming forward now?","After I left (in late 2014), Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue me. So I had to sign an NDA back in 2015 saying I wouldn’t talk to the media about anything I saw there.","But that was before 2016 happened, the rise of the alt-right and Donald Trump and a lot of the vitriolic, nativist discourse we’re seeing.","My life was pretty chill before this; I didn’t need to take on a billionaire and now apparently the most important social network in the world. But I think it’s really important that people look at this because the integrity of our democratic process is at stake.","But let me be super clear: I accept that I have a lot of responsibility. A lot of this was my fault. But it is not solely my fault. This happened on Facebook’s watch, and more fundamentally this was funded, authorized, approved, and encouraged by Steve Bannon and Cambridge Analytica.","Do you feel guilty?","I feel immensely guilty.","Didn't you feel that way at the time?","I let my curiosity get the better of me. I should have done a much better job of due diligence, a much better job at ensuring we had an ethical framework in place.","But… the culture of the company...I fell into that culture, that’s not to excuse it. I accept blame for that.","What does this mean for the future?","There’s an element of inevitability in state actors using the internet to influence democracies in other parts of the world.","What I would say is this isn’t new; it’s just new for the West. The internet has made the American electorate accessible to a lot of other countries.","Has this broken the model for democracy?","I would never want to say democracy is broken. The fact we can have this conversation means it isn’t. But things won’t be like before.","So we need to think about this more broadly. Whether it’s a regulatory legal framework or whether we consider the integrity of our national elections as a national security issue, these are things legislators need to talk about."],"isopubdate":""}

This weekend, Facebook banned the high-profile data firm Cambridge Analytica — paid more than $6 million by President Trump’s 2016 campaign — after a joint New York Times/Guardian probe revealed the improper harvesting of data from an estimated 50 million users of the platform.","Nixon on steroids, indeed. In 1972, the 37th president’s dirty tricksters got caught in the Watergate with some Radio Shack-style gizmos and some badly applied duct tape trying to bug the Democratic Party’s headquarters so they could try to steal the words of one man, party chief Larry O’Brien. That act — and the various cover-ups and sleazy maneuvers that surrounded it — cost Richard Nixon his presidency.","You might have heard this weekend that Facebook — from whom the data was obtained and where much of the ensuing psychological warfare took place in the summer and fall of 2016 — has now banned the firm, Cambridge Analytica. It was not a bold move by Mark Zuckerberg’s social media behemoth but a cowardly one, taken just minutes before some stellar reporting by the Guardian’s Carole Cadwalladr and journalists from the New York Times jointly exposed the hijacking of the data and, arguably, the theft of an American presidential election. Facebook’s too-little-too-late action was the ultimate closing of the barn door after the horse has already bolted — the horse being American democracy.","What CA lacked, however, was the data the pull this off. That’s when what Facebook’s top lawyer has now acknowledged was “a scam — and a fraud” came into play. Wylie — the young political data maven now turned whistleblower — and the team assembled by Mercer and Bannon turned to experts in “psychometrics” at Britain’s Cambridge University; there, a Russian American (heh … a bit more on that later) professor named Aleksandr Kogan was hired for $800,000. Kogan reportedly then lied to Facebook about his real project — a personality quiz and an app that 270,000 people consented to but which allowed the firm to pull Facebook “likes” and other personal info from 50 million unsuspecting Americans. (The company also seems to have lied to Facebook about later destroying the data.)","Indeed, Wylie noted that Cambridge Analytica emerged from a defense contractor called SCL and what it began to market in the mid-2000s was “cyber warfare for elections.” The Mercer-and-Bannon-backed CA was initially hired to work for GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016 — Mercer’s initial horse in the race — but the team had switched by summer 2016 to party nominee Trump, which then paid the firm about $6 million.","What does political cyber warfare look like? As you might imagine, pretty ugly. In an election where most voters’ preferences are deeply rooted, a campaign like the one engineered by Cambridge Analytica tried to tap into the psychology of the voters who could most easily be peeled away from Trump’s opponent Hillary Clinton — young people who might be convinced to vote third-party, or blacks who’d been enthusiastic about Barack Obama but could be discouraged from showing up in 2016. Data seemingly as trivial as what sneakers or candy bars you like helped develop profiles of the persuadable.","There are three big takeaways here. The first one goes well beyond Trump’s election as president. Folks have been warning about this for years, but clearly we have created something of a monster in the rise of social media. Make no mistake: There are many positives you can attribute to sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram: reconnecting with friends from yesteryear, getting information about news or sports in real time, or launching powerful social movements. But at the end of the day, a capitalist company such as Facebook and its billionaire founder Zuckerberg have gotten rich by exploiting the essence of our humanity — our friendships and even our personalities — for profit. The Trump-Cambridge Analytica scandal is a two-lane highway to hell — your intimate personal data flowing north to shady operators, then flowing back south as divisive negative politics or even “fake news.” That’s an existential threat not just to democracy but to a broader civil society."],"isopubdate":""}

It needs users that are active and engaged. It needs to know not just which link you’re likely to click, but also what makes you more or less likely to click it.","How does Facebook gather that kind of information?","By looking at your daily Facebook activity, for one. Analyzing the posts and pages that you like. And by running psychological experiments.","Wait, what?","Where the Wild Things Are","Image Credit: Shaiith via Shutterstock","Yes, Facebook has been conducting social experiments on its users. And yes, chances are you’ve involuntarily taken part at some point.","Is there a way to know for sure? Not really. But we’ve put together a list of Facebook experiments on users that are now known to the public. Have a look through these and see if anything rings a bell.","What happened: Facebook data scientists manipulated the news feeds of almost 690,000 users, showing some of them more positive updates and others more negative ones. All to see how it affected the users’ moods.","The study was described by the public as “disturbing,” mainly because of the ethics of the experiment. After all, it involved hundreds of thousands of users unknowingly participating in a study that may have made them either happier or more depressed than usual.","What Facebook found out: Our emotions can indeed be affected by what we’re exposed to on Facebook.","Did Facebook violate your privacy? Many people say that it did. And we’re inclined to agree. Even if this type of manipulation can’t be classified as a privacy violation, it definitely seems unethical.","What happened: In this study, Facebook was trying to find out if the ads work better on you if your friends endorse them. They showed the users two different types of ads — with and without endorsements like “Peter Parker liked this” — and then measured how many clicks those got.","What Facebook found out: The stronger your bond with a friend is, the more likely you are to click the link.","What happened: Facebook researchers singled out status updates with requests in them, like “Can someone recommend a movie for tonight?” or “I need a ride to work tomorrow.” They were interested in those regularly asking for help rather than whether they actually got it.","What Facebook found out: Users who have a lot of friends on Facebook but visit the network less often are more likely to ask for help.","Did Facebook violate your privacy? No. The updates the researchers analyzed are public ones, hence, no invasion of privacy really.","What happened: Facebook was trying to find out if your emotional state affects your friends. They looked at one million users’ status updates, both positive and negative, and then looked at the positivity or negativity of the posts of those users’ 150 million friends.","What Facebook found out: During the three days of running this study, the researchers found that the friends of the users with positive updates were suppressing their negative posts and vice versa. If you post something positive on Facebook, one out of every 100 friends (who wouldn’t have otherwise, according to the study) will do the same within 3 days.","Did Facebook violate your privacy? Could go either way. This study is believed to have led to the big emotion manipulation experiment mentioned earlier in the article.","What happened: The main purpose of this study was to find out whether broadcasting your intention to buy something will have an effect on your friends’ buying interests.","Facebook offered special deals, like free items, to certain users. If you accepted an offer, it would either be auto-shared so all your friends could see it or you’d be given a choice in the matter. The second group got a button they could click to choose whether they want their offers broadcasted.","What Facebook found out: More offers get claimed when everyone in your friends list gets to see them.","Did Facebook violate your privacy? Yes. Auto-sharing is invasive and frankly creepy. The study’s results show that only 23 percent of the users who had the choice decided to share it.","Number of people involved: 253 million (half of all Facebook users at the time)","What happened: In order to find out how information spreads on Facebook, researchers randomly assigned 75 million URLs a “share” or “no-share” status. The links included anything from news articles to job offers. Those with the “no-share” status wouldn’t appear in your friends’ news feeds at all. Facebook wanted to know if the censored information would still find a way to the surface.","What Facebook found out: Big surprise: users are more likely to spread the information that they see their friends sharing. Also, according to the study, your distant friends are more likely to expose you to new information than your close friends.","Did Facebook violate your privacy? Definitely. Just imagine how much information Facebook deliberately censored by Facebook during this study. Hopefully it was nothing important. And the fact that they very closely tracked and monitored what you posted and how it affected your friends seems dubiously ethical as well.","What happened: In 2010, just before the midterm elections, Facebook researchers planted an “I voted” button at the top of the users’ news feeds, along with the information about their polling place. You could also see the names of your friends who had clicked the button. The researchers then checked public voting records to see which of the subjects actually voted.","What Facebook found out: Can Facebook encourage people to vote? It appears so. Users were more likely to click the “I Voted” button if they saw their friends’ names next to it. Researchers found that people who got the “I Voted” message in their News Feed were 0.39 percent more likely to have actually voted. Those seem like small percentages, but with the number of people involved in the experiment, that makes 340,000 possible votes that may not have otherwise happened.","Did Facebook violate your privacy? Maybe not, but it seems highly unethical. This one could have potentially caused an electoral swing if the button was displayed only to select groups. And none of the users realized that they were part of this experiment or that Facebook would look up their names in voting records.","Important Conclusions","Image Credit: Den Rise via Shutterstock","Can Facebook get away with this? Yes. Facebook doesn’t need you to sign consent forms, as you’ve already agreed to the site’s data policy when you created your account.","Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *","Comment","Name *","Email *","Trutherator","May 9, 2018 at 10:33 am","Duh. Still debating what to do?","I deleted myself entirely out of Facebook.

Just Read It.","text":["I have been an FBI Special Agent for over 21 years. I spent half of that time investigating Russian Organized Crime as a street agent and Supervisor in New York City. I have spent the second half of my career focusing on national security issues and protecting this country from terrorism. I served in some of the most challenging, demanding investigative and leadership roles in the FBI. And I was privileged to serve as Deputy Director during a particularly tough time.","For the last year and a half, my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country. Articles too numerous to count have leveled every sort of false, defamatory and degrading allegation against us. The president’s tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all. He called for my firing. He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service. And all along we have said nothing, never wanting to distract from the mission of the FBI by addressing the lies told and repeated about it.","No more.","The investigation by the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) has to be understood in the context of the attacks on my credibility. The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBI’s involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton. I was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau and to make it clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.","The OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the same type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week. In fact it was the same type of work that I continued to do under Director Wray, at his request. The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth. During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.","But looking at that in isolation completely misses the big picture. The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people.","Here is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey’s accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG’s focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens. Thursday’s comments from the White House are just the latest example of this.","This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this Administration’s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel’s work.","I have always prided myself on serving my country with distinction and integrity, and I have always encouraged those around me to do the same. Just ask them. To have my career end in this way, and to be accused of lacking candor when at worst I was distracted in the midst of chaotic events, is incredibly disappointing and unfair. But it will not erase the important work I was prevailed to be a part of, the results of which will in the end be revealed for the country to see.","I have unfailing faith in the men and women of the FBI and I am confident that their efforts to seek justice will not be deterred."],"isopubdate":""}

In what legal experts say may be a “watershed” case, a US citizen is using British laws to try to discover how he was profiled and potentially targeted by the Trump campaign.","David Carroll, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design in New York, has discovered a transatlantic legal mechanism that he hopes will give him access to information being sought by both the FBI and the Senate intelligence committee. In recent weeks, investigators looking at how people acting on behalf of Russia targeted American voters have focused on Trump’s data operation. But although the FBI obtained a court order against Facebook to make it disclose evidence, the exact way in which US citizens were profiled and targeted remains largely unknown.","But British data protection laws may provide some transparency on the company at the heart of Trump’s data operation – Cambridge Analytica – and how it created profiles of 240 million Americans. In January, Carroll discovered he – and a group of other citizens – had the right under UK law to ask for his personal data back from the company, and when it failed to supply it, he started filing pre-trial actions to sue the company under British law. The lawsuit is the result of a unique situation, according to Ravi Naik of Irvine Thanvi Natas, the British solicitor who is leading the case. It arose because although Cambridge Analytica is largely owned by Trump’s biggest donor, hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and though its vice-president at the time of the US election was Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the company was spun out of an older British military and elections contractor, SCL, with which it still shares staff, directors and a London office.","In the US, Americans have almost no rights over their data whatsoever","Ravi Naik","Naik says: “It’s this fascinating situation because when it became apparent that Cambridge Analytica had processed Americans’ data in Britain, it suddenly opened up this window of opportunity. In the US, Americans have almost no rights over their data whatsoever, but the data protection framework is set up in such a way that it doesn’t matter where people are: it matters where the data is processed.","“I’m a human rights practitioner and in the past most of my cases were national security issues, but increasingly it’s about data protection and the way people are affected by the misuse of their data. I see this as an issue affecting fundamental rights and it’s taking citizen activism to uncover what’s going on, to request data. I really hear echoes of the civil rights movement in people becoming more aware, more resistant and willing to fight.”","As an academic, Carroll had studied advertising, data and design, but he was still shocked when Cambridge Analytica eventually sent him a “profile” that it had created about him though not the data it was created from. “It was very strange and unsettling because they had given me ‘scores’ for different issues but I had no idea what they’d based this on.” The company scored him 3/10 on “Gun Rights Importance”, 7/10 on “National Security Importance” and “unlikely” to vote Republican.","“I was perplexed by it. I started thinking, ‘Have I had conversations about gun rights on Facebook? Where are they getting this from? And what are they doing with it?’” He reported the firm to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, which is investigating the use of data in political campaigning; he has also launched a CrowdJustice campaign and is appealing to the public to help him take the case as far as he can through the British courts.","It really is a David and Goliath fight and I think it will be the model for other citizens’ actions against other big corporations","Frank Pasquale, University of Maryland","“There are so many disturbing aspects to this. One of the things that really troubles me is how the company can buy anonymous data completely legally from all these different sources, but as soon as it attaches it to voter files, you are re-identified. It means that every privacy policy we have ignored in our use of technology is a broken promise. It would be one thing if this information stayed in the US, if it was an American company and it only did voter data stuff.”","But, he argues, “it’s not just a US company and it’s not just a civilian company”. Instead, he says, it has ties with the military through SCL – “and it doesn’t just do voter targeting”. Carroll has provided information to the Senate intelligence committee and believes that the disclosures mandated by a British court could provide evidence helpful to investigators.","Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland, author of The Black Box Society and a leading expert on big data and the law, called the case a “watershed moment”.","“It really is a David and Goliath fight and I think it will be the model for other citizens’ actions against other big corporations. I think we will look back and see it as a really significant case in terms of the future of algorithmic accountability and data protection. These issues are so critical and in the US there are only these incredible, lethargic data laws largely because of the incredible power of the lobbying industry.”","Big data’s power is terrifying. That could be good news for democracy | George Monbiot","Read more","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician who has created the firm PersonalData.IO to help people reclaim their data, and who helped Carroll with his quest, said it was important that people realised that there are tools they can use against big corporations.","“In the US election, the FBI has been trying to get information from the top down but this doesn’t help with regard to the French election or Brexit,” Dehaye said. “And we know we just cannot trust Facebook, even with good intent, to run our elections fairly. There are a few huge companies amassing vast amounts of data on vast amounts of people and there’s no democratic oversight.”","Pasquale said news that Facebook information had been used by Russian agents to target US citizens may prove to be a tipping point. “It shows this information has now been weaponised by a state actor. What we’re seeing is really a failure of the first order. Mark Zuckerberg wrote this 6,000-word letter about creating a global political community and yet we now know that Facebook was a platform for a devastating attack on the most robust democracy in the world.”"],"isopubdate":"2017-09-30"}

Some Republicans have even called on Trump to abandon his run, although Trump has pledged to carry on.","The Clinton campaign huddled in their office Sunday evening before the debate, discussing Trump's decision to invite the women to the debate. Two aides acknowledged to CNN they didn't expect this -- in all their planning and were jarred by the news.","Hillary Clinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri responded moments after news of the live streaming video broke, saying,\"We're not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom.\"","\"Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn't change that.

When subpoenaed in relation to the Jones case, Broaddrick filed an affidavit denying she was assaulted. She later changed her story and in 1999 accused Bill Clinton of rape in the late 1970s.","Independent Counsel Ken Starr's team thoroughly investigated her claim and noted in his exhaustive Whitewater Report that Broaddrick had changed her story.","Congressional Republicans at the time did not think she was credible and she was not called to testify in Clinton's impeachment trial.","\"I'm here to support Mr. Trump because he's going to make America great again ...

In addition to discussing education, Cook addressed a handful of recent topics, ranging from the Facebook debacle and user privacy to Apple’s next campus and jobs.","Asked about Facebook, Cook said that while he believes that the best regulation is self-regulation — without government involvement — it is too late at this point for Facebook to regulate itself. “It’s clear to me that something, some large profound change is needed,” Cook said. “I’m personally not a big fan of regulation because sometimes regulation can have unexpected consequences to it, however I think this certain situation is so dire, and has become so large, that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary.”","Cook was asked what he would be doing right now if he was Mark Zuckerberg. “I wouldn’t be in this situation,” Cook replied. He also reiterated Apple’s view that “privacy to us is a human right, a civil liberty,” and that Apple has elected not to monetize its users’ personal lives.","He also offered some fairly disconcerting advice on how users should protect their privacy, in light of the Facebook situation:","I would make sure I understood the privacy policy of every app and every website you frequent.

On a scale of one to 10, they ranked Carroll's views on issues including gun rights, education, health care, and \"traditional social and moral values.\"","David Carroll","However, Carroll alleges that the data firm did not fully disclose how it arrived at their predictions.","Read More","\"If you just go by the topics, they are ranked in a way that demographics alone can't explain,\" Carroll told CNN. \"Just by using my age and gender and zip code, they can't get such an accurate list. There has to be more.\"","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment about Carroll's case. The firm was quoted in Mother Jones in December saying Carroll's claims \"are unfounded, and unfortunately, he is wasting other people's money with this spurious legal action. Cambridge Analytica abides by all relevant data protection laws and, just as importantly, the company's core values of integrity, respect and honesty. Data privacy is a fundamental right and one that Cambridge Analytica takes very seriously.\"","On Friday, Carroll's lawyers said they submitted a request to a British court to order Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, to hand over all the data they have on the professor and the source of that data.","In his written statement to court, Caroll said, \"In particular, I am concerned that I may have been targeted with messages that criticized Secretary Hillary Clinton with falsified or exaggerated information that negatively affected my sentiment about her candidacy and consequently discouraged me from engaging with the Clinton campaign as a formal or informal volunteer.\"","Carroll's lawyer, Ravi Naik, said in a statement Friday, \"Our client has every confidence that the court will order disclosure so that he and the American electorate can begin to understand how their data was used in the 2016 election. The recent wider revelations about Cambridge Analytica/SCL show how crucial it is for our client to have a full understanding of what these companies were doing.\"","Under British law, individuals can submit what are known as \"subject access\" requests to organizations that hold information about them. In most cases the organizations need to respond within 40 days with a copy of the data, the source of the data, and if the organization will be giving the data to others.","\"It was pretty experimental at the beginning,\" Carroll said, \" I was studying the practice of ad targeting from the primaries and through the campaign because it was interesting to me from an academic perspective.\"","Carroll said when he realized Cambridge Analytica had a British branch, he decided to file a subject access request in January 2017, not knowing if the company would be obliged to respond given that he isn't a British citizen.","A few weeks later, however, the company responded providing Carroll with a spreadsheet of information it had about him.","Carroll, a registered Democrat, said that the company had accurately predicted his views on some issues and less so on others. Cambridge scored Carroll a nine out of 10 on what it called a \"traditional social and moral values importance rank.\" Caroll said he wants to know what that ranking means and what it is based on.","Cambridge Analytica's file on David Carroll included predictions on how Carroll felt about various issues","Appearing before a British parliamentary committee earlier this month, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was asked if his company would provide American citizens, like David Carroll, all the data it holds on them and tell them where the data came from.","Nix said that there was no legislation in the US that provided for individuals to make such a request.","On Friday, Facebook announced it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and parent Strategic Communication Laboratories from Facebook. The move came ahead of reports published by The New York Times and British newspaper The Observer that called into question how the companies had handled Facebook data.","In a statement, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica denied that the organization is in violation of Facebook's terms and said it is in communication with the social media site following the news it had been suspended from the platform.","The company added that no data that was obtained through a company called Global Science Research, which mined Facebook data, was used as part of the services Cambridge Analytica provided to the Trump 2016 presidential campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

A notification system, perhaps via an optional extension for Google’s Chrome browser, was an idea that these people said was broached more than once. Such a browser-based system controlled by Google could alert users on Facebook’s or Twitter’s websites when they’re seeing or sharing a link deemed to be false or untrustworthy.","Right now, this appears to be merely an idea company executives are discussing, not a product in development. “We aren’t working on anything like this,” a Google spokeswoman told Quartz. But Alphabet did flag “misleading” information and “objectionable content” as risks to the company’s financial performance in its annual report this week, for the first time ever. And the fact that executives were focused on the topic at Davos indicates the tech company’s willingness to take a more active role in filtering out fake news and propaganda.","A misinformation detector","The comments by Google executives highlight potential flashpoints that could develop between Google and social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. Tech companies have traditionally bristled at competitors’ interfering with how users access their sites, such as via browser software and extensions—as the Google executives were describing. Google years ago built and aggressively marketed Chrome in part to head off any attempt by Microsoft to use its Internet Explorer browser software to restrict users’ access to Google services.","Google’s new ad blocker in Chrome is an example of how the company can override other sites’ content for users of its browser—it will block out ads that don’t adhere to a coalition’s standards, starting Feb. 15. (Unlike the fake-news notifications discussed, that ad blocker will be turned on by default for Chrome users.)","Google executives at Davos were actively “thinking through how they can play a role in how they deal with fake news and bots,” said the CEO of one Silicon Valley company, who said he was involved in more than one conversation with them on the topic at Davos. Because hundreds of millions of people rely on its Chrome browser and Google’s search engine to find factual data, the company sits in a “unique position” to do so, the executive pointed out. “Their mission is to help organize the world’s information,” he said, so their involvement makes sense. (The Davos attendees who described the discussions with Google to Quartz requested anonymity because they were private conversations.)","Google executives talked about creating a browser extension that worked like a spell-checker, but was a “misinformation detector,” said another Davos attendee who participated in one such conversation.","The factuality issue","The idea presents some obvious hurdles—among them the question of who determines what is misinformation, which can involve individual judgment and political sensitivity.","“You’d have to take a stand about factuality,” said Timothy Snyder, a Yale history professor and author of On Tyranny, who attended the Davos conference and said he heard second-hand about Google executives’ fake news discussions. You can’t use a “protocol or an algorithm,” he said, you need “human beings who take responsibility for things.”","Last April, Google said it would try to improve its search results through efforts to demote low-quality content, such as “misleading information, unexpected offensive results, hoaxes, and unsupported conspiracy theories.” The company also recently revamped how it creates its “featured snippets” appearing at the top of search results to give more weight to high-quality information.","There are also some outside projects underway that Google could theoretically tap for assessments of links and sources. News Guard, a startup by publisher Steve Brill and former Wall Street Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz, has raised $6 million and is hiring dozens of journalists who will rate news content by trustworthiness. The Trust Project brings together a group of news organizations at Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics to create “trust indicators” that explain the “work behind a news story,” including journalists’ credentials and a publisher’s financial backing (Google already provides funding for this). Storyful and Moat have partnered with the City University of New York’s journalism school to create Open Brand Safety which identifies and tracks web domains and video URLs that spread misleading content.","Reliance on users","Another major hurdle is that an optional desktop browser extension is unlikely to impact the vast majority of Facebook usage. While Google’s Chrome browser is by far the world’s most popular, most of Facebook’s two billion users access the social media network through an app on their smart phones, as is common for most social-media platforms. And getting users to take the step of installing or activating an optional browser extension could prove a hurdle.","Perversely, identifying news as not trustworthy could also cause it to spread farther. Facebook has said that when it put red flags next to links to fake news, users clicked on them more—so Facebook discontinued that practice and started providing related links instead. “Academic research on correcting misinformation has shown that putting a strong image, like a red flag, next to an article may actually entrench deeply held beliefs—the opposite effect to what we intended,” Facebook explained. A Facebook spokesman said he couldn’t comment on any potential Google plans.","To get such a system to actually work, “you have to make people feel good about passing on factual information,” Snyder said. Perhaps that means giving people who are very careful about passing on reliable information a positive social media rating, he said.","A last-ditch approach?","A final question is more philosophical. Can, and should, Google (which some critics say is already too powerful) play the role of filtering out what’s true and what is not?","“Of course it can’t,” said Rachel Botsman, a lecturer at Oxford’s Saïd Business School and author of Who Can You Trust, who attended the Davos conference. And, she added, “we don’t want it to.”","“People are really grasping at straws because no one has the solution here” for how to tackle fake news, Botsman said. Technology companies are hoping to avoid more regulations like the ones cropping up in Europe, she said. This summer Germany passed a law that will fine social media companies €50 million for failing to quickly remove hate speech on their platforms.","One theme Botsman said she heard again and again from tech companies at Davos was “Do you really want what’s happening in Germany coming down on the rest of the world?”"],"isopubdate":"2018-02-08"}

Tech insiders on why you should care","Silicon Valley is engineering your phone, apps and social media to get you hooked, says a former Google product manager. Anderson Cooper reports","2017Jun 11","CorrespondentAnderson Cooper","Facebook","Twitter","Reddit","Flipboard","Have you ever wondered if all those people you see staring intently at their smartphones -- nearly everywhere, and at all times -- are addicted to them? According to a former Google product manager you are about to hear from, Silicon Valley is engineering your phone, apps and social media to get you hooked. As we first reported in April, he is one of the few tech insiders to publicly acknowledge that the companies responsible for programming your phones are working hard to get you and your family to feel the need to check in constantly. Some programmers call it \"brain hacking\" and the tech world would probably prefer you didn't hear about it. But Tristan Harris openly questions the long-term consequences of it all and we think it's worth putting down your phone to listen.","Tristan Harris, a former Google product manager","CBS News","Tristan Harris: This thing is a slot machine.","Anderson Cooper: How is that a slot machine?","Tristan Harris: Well every time I check my phone, I'm playing the slot machine to see, \"What did I get?\" This is one way to hijack people's minds and create a habit, to form a habit. What you do is you make it so when someone pulls a lever, sometimes they get a reward, an exciting reward. And it turns out that this design technique can be embedded inside of all these products.","The rewards Harris is talking about are a big part of what makes smartphones so appealing. The chance of getting likes on Facebook and Instagram. Cute emojis in text messages. And new followers on Twitter.","Tristan Harris: There's a whole playbook of techniques that get used to get you using the product for as long as possible.","Anderson Cooper: What kind of techniques are used?","\"...every time I check my phone, I'm playing the slot machine to see, 'What did I get?' This is one way to hijack people's minds and create a habit, to form a habit.\" Tristan Harris","Tristan Harris: Tristan Harris: So Snapchat's the most popular messaging service for teenagers. And they invented this feature called \"streaks,\" which shows the number of days in a row that you've sent a message back and forth with someone. So now you could say, \"Well, what's the big deal here?\" Well, the problem is that kids feel like, \"Well, now I don't want to lose my streak.\" But it turns out that kids actually when they go on vacation are so stressed about their streak that they actually give their password to, like, five other kids to keep their streaks going on their behalf. And so you could ask when these features are being designed, are they designed to most help people live their life? Or are they being designed because they're best at hooking people into using the product?","Anderson Cooper: Is Silicon Valley programming apps or are they programming people?","Tristan Harris: Inadvertently, whether they want to or not, they are shaping the thoughts and feelings and actions of people. They are programming people. There's always this narrative that technology's neutral. And it's up to us to choose how we use it. This is just not true.","Anderson Cooper: Technology's not neutral?","Tristan Harris: It's not neutral. They want you to use it in particular ways and for long periods of time. Because that's how they make their money.","It's rare for a tech insider to be so blunt, but Tristan Harris believes someone needs to be. A few years ago he was living the Silicon Valley dream. He dropped out of a master's program at Stanford University to start a software company. Four years later Google bought him out and hired him as a product manager. It was while working there he started to feel overwhelmed.","Tristan Harris: Honestly, I was just bombarded in email and calendar invitations and just the overload of what it's like to work at a place like Google. And I was asking, \"When is all of this adding up to, like, an actual benefit to my life?\" And I ended up making this presentation. It was kind of a manifesto. And it basically said, you know, \"Look, never before in history have a handful of people at a handful of technology companies shaped how a billion people think and feel every day with the choices they make about these screens.\"","\"Inadvertently, whether they want to or not, they are shaping the thoughts and feelings and actions of people. They are programming people.\" Tristan Harris","His 144-page presentation argued that the constant distractions of apps and emails are \"weakening our relationships to each other,\" and \"destroying our kids ability to focus.\" It was widely read inside Google, and caught the eye of one of the founders Larry Page. But Harris told us it didn't lead to any changes and after three years he quit.","Tristan Harris: And it's not because anyone is evil or has bad intentions. It's because the game is getting attention at all costs. And the problem is it becomes this race to the bottom of the brainstem, where if I go lower on the brainstem to get you, you know, using my product, I win. But it doesn't end up in the world we want to live in. We don't end up feeling good about how we're using all this stuff.","Anderson Cooper: You call this a \"race to the bottom of the brain stem.\" It's a race to the most primitive emotions we have? Fear, anxiety, loneliness, all these things?","Tristan Harris: Absolutely. And that's again because in the race for attention I have to do whatever works.","Tristan Harris: It absolutely wants one thing, which is your attention.","Now he travels the country trying to convince programmers and anyone else who will listen that the business model of tech companies needs to change. He wants products designed to make the best use of our time not just grab our attention.","Anderson Cooper: Do you think parents understand the complexities of what their kids are dealing with, when they're dealing with their phone, dealing with apps and social media?","Tristan Harris: No. And I think this is really important. Because there's a narrative that, \"Oh, I guess they're just doing this like we used to gossip on the phone, but what this misses is that your telephone in the 1970s didn't have a thousand engineers on the other side of the telephone who were redesigning it to work with other telephones and then updating the way your telephone worked every day to be more and more persuasive. That was not true in the 1970s.","Anderson Cooper: How many Silicon Valley insiders are there speaking out like you are?","Tristan Harris: Not that many.","We reached out to the biggest tech firms but none would speak on the record and some didn't even return our phone call. Most tech companies say their priority is improving user experience, something they call \"engagement.\" But they remain secretive about what they do to keep people glued to their screens. So we went to Venice, California, where the body builders on the beach are being muscled out by small companies that specialize in what Ramsay Brown calls \"brain hacking.\"","Ramsay Brown: A computer programmer who now understands how the brain works knows how to write code that will get the brain to do certain things.","Ramsay Brown studied neuroscience before co-founding Dopamine Labs, a start-up crammed into a garage. The company is named after the dopamine molecule in our brains that aids in the creation of desire and pleasure. Brown and his colleagues write computer code for apps used by fitness companies and financial firms. The programs are designed to provoke a neurological response.","\"A computer programmer who now understands how the brain works knows how to write code that will get the brain to do certain things.\" Ramsay Brown","Anderson Cooper: You're trying to figure out how to get people coming back to use the screen?","Ramsay Brown: When should I make you feel a little extra awesome to get you to come back into the app longer?","Ramsay Brown","CBS News","The computer code he creates finds the best moment to give you one of those rewards, which have no actual value, but Brown says trigger your brain to make you want more. For example, on Instagram, he told us sometimes those likes come in a sudden rush.","Ramsay Brown: They're holding some of them back for you to let you know later in a big burst. Like, hey, here's the 30 likes we didn't mention from a little while ago. Why that moment--","Anderson Cooper: So all of a sudden you get a big burst of likes?","Ramsay Brown: Yeah, but why that moment? There's some algorithm somewhere that predicted, hey, for this user right now who is experimental subject 79B3 in experiment 231, we think we can see an improvement in his behavior if you give it to him in this burst instead of that burst.","When Brown says \"experiments,\" he's talking generally about the millions of computer calculations being used every moment by his company and others use to constantly tweak your online experience and make you come back for more.","Ramsay Brown: You're part of a controlled set of experiments that are happening in real time across you and millions of other people.","Anderson Cooper: We're guinea pigs?","Ramsay Brown: You're guinea pigs. You are guinea pigs in the box pushing the button and sometimes getting the likes. And they're doing this to keep you in there.","The longer we look at our screens, the more data companies collect about us, and the more ads we see. Ad spending on social media has doubled in just two years to more than $31 billion.","Ramsay Brown: You don't pay for Facebook. Advertisers pay for Facebook. You get to use it for free because your eyeballs are what's being sold there.","Anderson Cooper: That's an interesting way to look at it, that you're not the customer for Facebook.","\"You don't pay for Facebook. Advertisers pay for Facebook. You get to use it for free because your eyeballs are what's being sold there.\" Ramsay Brown","Ramsay Brown: You're not the customer. You don't sign a check to Facebook. But Coca-Cola does.","Brown says there's a reason texts and Facebook use a continuous scroll, because it's a proven way to keep you searching longer.","Ramsay Brown: You spend half your time on Facebook just scrolling to find one good piece worth looking at. It's happening because they are engineered to become addictive.","Anderson Cooper: You're almost saying it like there's an addiction code.","Ramsay Brown: Yeah, that is the case. That since we've figured out, to some extent, how these pieces of the brain that handle addiction are working, people have figured out how to juice them further and how to bake that information into apps.","Larry Rosen: Dinner table could be a technology-free zone.","While Brown is tapping into the power of dopamine, psychologist Larry Rosen and his team at California State University Dominguez Hills are researching the effect technology has on our anxiety levels.","Larry Rosen: We're looking at the impact of technology through the brain.","Rosen told us when you put your phone down – your brain signals your adrenal gland to produce a burst of a hormone called, cortisol, which has an evolutionary purpose. Cortisol triggers a fight-or-flight response to danger.","Anderson Cooper: How does cortisol relate to a mobile device, a phone?","Larry Rosen: What we find is the typical person checks their phone every 15 minutes or less and half of the time they check their phone there is no alert, no notification. It's coming from inside their head telling them, \"Gee, I haven't check in Facebook in a while. I haven't checked on this Twitter feed for a while. I wonder if somebody commented on my Instagram post.\" That then generates cortisol and it starts to make you anxious. And eventually your goal is to get rid of that anxiety so you check in.","So the same hormone that made primitive man anxious and hyperaware of his surroundings to keep him from being eaten by lions is today compelling Rosen's students and all of us to continually peek at our phones to relieve our anxiety.","Larry Rosen: When you put the phone down you don't shut off your brain, you just put the phone down.","Anderson Cooper: Can I be honest with you right now? I haven't paid attention to what you're saying because I just realized my phone is right down by my right foot and I haven't checked it in, like 10 minutes.","We found out just how anxious in this experiment conducted by Rosen's research colleague Nancy Cheever.","Nancy Cheever: So the first thing I'm going to do is apply these electrodes to your fingers.","While I watched a video, a computer tracked minute changes in my heart rate and perspiration. What I didn't know was that Cheever was sending text messages to my phone which was just out of reach. Every time my text notification went off, the blue line spiked – indicating anxiety caused in part by the release of cortisol.","Nancy Cheever: Oh, that one is…that's a huge spike right there. And if you can imagine what that's doing to your body. Every time you get a text message you probably can't even feel it right? Because it's such a um, it's a small amount of arousal.","Anderson Cooper: That's fascinating.","Their research suggests our phones are keeping us in a continual state of anxiety in which the only antidote – is the phone.","Anderson Cooper: Is it known what the impact of all this technology use is?","Larry Rosen: Absolutely not.","Anderson Cooper: It's too soon.","Larry Rosen: We're all part of this big experiment.","Anderson Cooper: What is this doing to a young mind or a teenager?","Larry Rosen: Well there's some projects going on where they're actually scanning teenager's brains over a 20-year period and looking to see what kind of changes they're finding.","Gabe Zichermann","CBS News","Gabe Zichermann: Here's the reality. Corporations and creators of content have, since the beginning of time, wanted to make their content as engaging as possible.","Gabe Zichermann has worked with dozens of companies – including Apple and CBS – to make their online products more irresistible. He's best known in Silicon Valley for his expertise in something called \"gamification,\" using techniques from video games to insert fun and competition into almost everything on your smartphone.","Gabe Zichermann: So one of the interesting things about gamification and other engaging technologies, is at the same time as we can argue that the neuroscience is being used to create dependent behavior those same techniques are being used to get people to work out, you know, using their Fitbit. So all of these technologies, all the techniques for engagement can be used for good, or can be used for bad.","\"Asking technology companies, asking content creators to be less good at what they do feels like a ridiculous ask.\" Gabe Zichermann","Zichermann is now working on software called 'Onward' designed to break user's bad habits. It will track a person's activity and can recommend they do something else when they're spending too much time online.","Gabe Zichermann: I think creators have to be liberated to make their content as good as possible.","Anderson Cooper: The idea that a tech company is not going to try to make their product as persuasive, as engaging as possible, you're just saying that's not gonna happen?","Gabe Zichermann: Asking technology companies, asking content creators to be less good at what they do feels like a ridiculous ask. It feels impossible. And also it's very anti-capitalistic, this isn't the system that we live in.","Ramsay Brown and his garage start-up Dopamine Labs made a habit-breaking app as well. It's called \"Space\" and it creates a 12-second delay -- what Brown calls a \"moment of Zen\" before any social media app launches. In January, he tried to convince Apple to sell it in their App Store.","Ramsay Brown: And they rejected it from the App Store because they told us any app that would encourage people to use other apps or their iPhone less was unacceptable for distribution in the App Store.","Anderson Cooper: They actually said that to you?","Ramsay Brown: They said that to us. They did not want us to give out this thing that was gonna make people less stuck on their phones.","A few days after our story first aired, Apple called to tell us it had a change of heart and made \"Space\" available in its App Store.","Anderson Cooper, anchor of CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360,\" has contributed to 60 Minutes since 2006. His exceptional reporting on big news events has earned Cooper a reputation as one of television's pre-eminent newsmen."],"isopubdate":""}

In today’s world, data is a form of soft power, and it is essential for those who wield it, to use it responsibly so that consumer confidence isn’t compromised.","The challenge is that, at an idea-generation stage, it can be difficult to draw a clear, bright line between whether data is being used for optimisation or for manipulation.","Take, for instance, the Obama and Trump campaigns in the US. The former used the same digital platforms for optimising communication and ensuring voter confidence and dissemination of information. On the other hand, British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used the same platforms but with malafide intent — to manipulate the views and preferences of voters.","As investigations continue, it is increasingly clear that data was stolen, models used were unauthorised for the purpose they were being used, the messages (in many cases) were outright lies.","So the whole operation was questionable from the get-go. It is, therefore, extremely critical to demarcate this difference — are the final consumers of a data-driven model being actively manipulated or is data being used to merely optimise a communications strategy?","It is also essential to clearly define the parties involved in the data “lifecycle” and their roles and responsibilities, with regard to how data is being used. There are usually three parties in this lifecycle, each requiring a different kind of oversight and norms.","First are the data originators, those that capture and store the data. And I’m not only talking about Facebook and Google, but also a wide range of other originators — for e.g. Equifax (which holds extremely sensitive consumer credit information), banks (which store individual-centric financial information), telecom organisations (which hold a treasure trove of communications and browsing information), etc.","Two safeguards are critical here.","One, data security safeguards to ensure the privacy (external parties shouldn’t be able to see it) and integrity (external parties shouldn’t be able to change it) of the data. This can be improved by ring-fencing the data sources and ensuring advanced security measures.","And two, ensuring explicit consumer consent for sharing and using this data. This can be done by introducing easy-to-understand verbiage around fair-use — where their data could be used and for what purposes.","These two interventions — data security and informing users where data could be shared — are the key and will go a long way in winning back consumer trust in these platforms.","The second type of entity involved is the data processing companies which employ intelligent algorithms over the data to extract insights. This includes companies like Cambridge Analytica.","Given that data processing companies also have access to a large scale of data, entrusted by clients, it is imperative that their systems are subject to similar levels of security, compliance and governance norms.","This can be resolved through globally-agreed standards of security, enforced through regular third-party audits. We need to be held to the same standards as the data sources themselves when it comes to security of the data so that we aren’t the weak link in the event of a data leak.","There may also be value in exploring how we can expressly declare the nature of algorithms employed and the source of these algorithms (in cases where there is a patent to one), to an unaffiliated third-party regulator. This will ensure better transparency around what the data is being used for.","Finally, we have the third party in the data lifecycle: The buyers of the data — organisations that pay for the data and algorithm-driven insights around it. In this case, they are the political organisations that are beneficiaries of the analysis work by the processing companies.","Here, let’s go back to my earlier point of drawing the line between what is optimisation and manipulation.","Are the data buying organisations sponsoring an ad because they feel consumers genuinely stand to benefit from the content, or are they using the data to manipulate users into actions that are not in their best interest?","More importantly, does the ad-sponsoring organisation have the authority to display that ad, or are they a geo-political adversary? This can be cleared up by implementing fair-usage policies around what the extracted data is being used for, who is using it, and what are the implications of that data — all of which needs to be made more transparent and subject to governance norms in certain cases.","Obviously, the three parties interplay with each other. For instance, Facebook and Google are two of these parties — the source and the processor. Thus, it needs to be ensured that they be accountable to both sets of norms.","It is imperative that all parties in the data lifecycle take seriously the trust with which data is being shared with them by their users — for their own good. The way things stand right now, biting around the edges of this debate is not going to win back lost consumer confidence in our industry and we are all the losers in the long term."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2","Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still don’t know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we won’t until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.","Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.","Cambridge Analytica’s CEO called the data the “secret sauce” that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics – including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5","For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the company’s poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebook’s settlement.6","Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are – or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data.","We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

{"originalurl":"http://wapo.st/2FZdgCf?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.ffa70b5b3fe8","title":"U.S. and British lawmakers demand answers from Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg - The Washington Post","text":["Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are calling on Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how the names, preferences and other information from tens of millions of users ended up in the hands of a data analysis firm connected with President Trump's 2016 campaign.","The demands came in response to news reports Saturday about how the firm, Cambridge Analytica, used a feature once available to Facebook app developers to collect information on 270,000 people and, in the process, gain access to data on tens of millions of their Facebook “friends” — few, if any, of whom had given explicit permission for this sharing.","Though both companies have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, this weekend’s demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either nation.","“They say ‘trust us,’ but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earliest stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just slip through the cracks unintentionally, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings.Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","In doing so, however, Kogan did not break into any systems, bypass any technical controls, or use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed. He did, however, misuse that data after he gathered it, but that does not retroactively make it a “breach”.","Stamos goes on in that thread — which is a long one — to explain the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."],"isopubdate":""}

Evidence suggests Building 8 is also working on a drone.","Building 8 will include a big retail push complete with warehouse operations, different retail experiences, and a \"global contact center footprint.\"","The all-start roster of tech veterans that Facebook began assembling one year ago is quietly making progress, steadily expanding the size of its ranks and the hardware prototypes under development.","The group, known as Building 8, currently has four simultaneous projects underway, spanning everything from cameras and augmented reality to science fiction-like brain scanning technology, Business Insider has learned.","And Facebook is already thinking about the coming out party for its impending family of gadgets, laying the groundwork to drum up interest and sell the products when the time is right. Building 8 has yet to unveil any of its products, but people familiar with the matter said the hardware group is expected to play a key role in Facebook's developer conference next month, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave his 10-year vision for the company last year.","To be part of this next wave, they've got to get real and hurry","The move to hardware is an ambitious and risky adventure for Facebook, which reigns as an internet superpower thanks to its nearly 2 billion users. With virtually no experience in the world of hardware, Facebook is taking on deep-pocketed competitors like Apple, Google and upstarts such as Snap, in a cut-throat business defined by thin profit margins and complex logistics.","And Facebook doesn't appear to be treating Building 8 like a hobby.","An analysis of Building 8's recent hires and job listings by Business Insider, as well as conversations with people close to the company, shows an ambitious effort to create and sell millions of consumer hardware units, from a supply chain outpost in Hong Kong to a planned retail push and customer call center operation.","Facebook declined to comment for this story.","Cardiologists and prosthetics","FacebookRegina Dugan","One of the current Building 8 projects involves cameras and augmented reality, according to people familiar with the matter, and recent hires point to the development of a drone.","Another project involves brain-scanning technology and is lead by a former John Hopkins neuroscientist who helped develop a mind-controlled prosthetic arm. Yet another project could have medical applications, as it's led by an interventional cardiologist from Stanford with expertise in early-stage medical device development. The group is also planning to jumpstart a fifth unspecified project, and is currently looking for the right person to lead it.","Building 8 is structured similarly to Google's Advanced Technology and Projects Group, or ATAP, and is also similar to X, the \"moonshot\" lab where Google's self-driving cars were born.","At Building 8, technical project leads are treated like mini-CEOs and given two-year deadlines to prove a concept that will either be shipped and sold or spun out into a different part of Facebook, which also owns Oculus VR, WhatsApp, and Instagram.","\"He's going to help us make things fly\"","The first such deadline is about a year away, coming up in the summer of 2018. Frank Dellaert, a robotics and computer vision expert, is leading that project. His involvement could suggest that Facebook is looking at making a consumer drone, something which Snapchat maker Snap Inc. has also looked into.","Before he joined Facebook last summer, Dellaert was the chief scientist at Skydio, a small startup that is working on an unreleased drone that can autonomously track a person while navigating through physical space. Dellaert also served as a professor at Georgia Tech and has shown specific interest in quadcopters, according to a person familiar with his work.","Additionally, Skydio's former head of hardware, Stephen McClure, joined Facebook to be Building 8's head of hardware in January, according to his LinkedIn profile. A handful of former GoPro employees have also joined Building 8 in recent months, including a founding member of the drone maker's industrial design team.","In a separate Facebook post announcing his hire, Building 8 chief Regina Dugan hinted at Dellaert's aerial ambitions. \"He's going to help us make things fly… when he's not guarding the door,\" she wrote.","FacebookFacebook's Aquila drone.","Workers from other parts of Facebook have also been pulled in to staff Building 8. One engineer who joined last year named Alex Granieri previously worked on Aquila, Facebook's high-altitude drone designed to beam internet connectivity to the developing world.","In an August 2016 post announcing his decision to join Building 8, Frank Dellaert signaled that his Building 8 project would be over by the summer of 2018, when he planned to return and teach at Georgia Tech.","\"I can't yet discuss the details of what I'll be working on at Building 8, so stay tuned,\" he wrote. \"Suffice it to say, I accepted this position because of the potential impact. I'm eager to apply DARPA-style development to building hardware products at Facebook - audacious science and product development in one place? Let's do it.\"","\"Disruptive shopping experiences\"","While Building 8 is only less than a year old, the group is already ramping up plans to release its products into the wild, with multiple open \"go-to-market,\" retail, supply chain, and customer experience job positions listed on its website.","An open retail manager position says the job will \"have the responsibility of creating disruptive ground up shopping experiences of Facebook consumer hardware,\" and another open partnerships lead position says the person will \"build an engaging and successful 3 year partnership strategy for Building 8 retail.\"","The listings also indicate that Facebook plans to leverage outside partnerships to sell its products. One responsibility for the partnerships lead position is to \"identify unique and inspiring collaborations that will drive innovation, impact social good, and inspire consumer loyalty and trust.\"","Shipping and selling consumer hardware to millions of people represents a new challenge for Facebook, which to date has only tried smaller-scale retail pushes for its expensive Oculus VR headset.","Facebook's early efforts with Building 8 are an indication that the company wants to be a serious player in augmented reality, which is considered to be the next frontier of technology, according to Loup Ventures partner Gene Munster.","\"They realize to be part of this next wave, they've got to get real and hurry,\" said Munster, who was previously known for his coverage of Apple as a Piper Jaffray analyst.","Munster, whose firm closely follows augmented and virtual reality companies, foresees Facebook wanting to ship at least 20 million units per year to be considered a successful consumer hardware company. Even then, he predicts that competition from the likes of larger companies like Apple and smaller incumbents like Snap Inc. will be strong.","Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesGoogle attempted to be an early player in augmented reality with its Glass eyewear. The product completely flopped.","\"It's a sign that they want to be more impactful and have a seat at the table,\" he said of Facebook's hardware efforts with Building 8. \"I think it's the right thing to do, but I'm hesitant to say it will be a success.\"","Still, Building 8 is continuing to make hires from well-known hardware companies.

Everyone seems to be surprised by this revelation but I’m honestly surprised it took this long and I wouldn’t be surprised if there are still hundreds, or even thousands, of companies in the same situation as Cambridge Analytica, albeit at a smaller scale.","The value of this data is immense and Facebook made it incredibly easy to access. It’s no surprise that some unsavory actors pulled this data and used it for whatever they needed to. And once you have the data why delete it? It’s not as if there’s any way to get caught and if you do you can just delete it then. If you’re competitors are doing this you also have a big incentive to play along and do the same thing. It’s tough being noble while you’re competitors are running amok, especially if the risk of getting caught is low.","Facebook is right in saying it’s not a security breach - there was no hack and the data was properly fetched via the official API. It is a violation of Facebook’s terms of service but the damage has already been done. Coupled with the privacy initiatives happening in Europe it does feel as if the world is starting to take privacy seriously.

Britain First is accused of spreading vile hateful messages about Muslims, but Cambridge Analytica is accused of acquiring the data of more than 50 million Facebook users via an illegitimate route.","Cambridge Analytica is the shady data analytics firm that specialises in “psychographic” profiling. In short, they scoop up data online and use it to create personality profiles for voters.","That knowledge could be extremely useful, as individuals can then be targeted with content targeted to appeal to them, and perhaps influence their behaviour. Maybe even change their likelihood to vote in a particular direction.","Cambridge Analytica is widely credited for helping Donald Trump’s successful campaign on social media to be elected President of the United States.","Investigations published this weekend by the New York Times and The Guardian have said that the profiles of some 50 million Facebook users were gathered without their knowledge, with a little help from a personality quiz created by a University of Cambridge professor.","Here’s what appears to have happened:","Psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, created an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” which offered to make personality predictions. 270,000 people downloaded it, and in the process made it possible for the app to scoop up personal information and details of their Facebook activity.","The app also asked for permission to request “more limited information” from a user’s friends. As a consequence details from some 50 million Facebook profiles were gathered.","Facebook app developers aren’t supposed to share users’ personal information with third parties, but Kogan appears to have passed the details on to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies.","Facebook says it learned of the violation in 2015, removed the app, and demanded assurances that Kogan and third-parties had destroyed the data.","Facebook has heard that the data was not deleted as promised, and has suspended the various parties pending further information.","Cambridge Analytica has issued a press release saying that it deleted the data “when it became clear” that the data had not been obtained in line with Facebook’s terms of service.","Much of the fuel on the fire has been poured by Christopher Wylie, Cambridge Analytica’s former director of research who the media has styled as a whistleblower.","Here is Wylie speaking to the UK’s Channel 4 News:","Never forget. Without your data, Facebook can’t make its fortune.","You may wish to ponder that next time you take an online personality quiz. You may want to rethink how wise it is to share so much information on social networks.

It looks like the photo was taken in 1999, when Obama was in his late 30s and a state senator in Illinois.","What’s more convincing is Columbia University didn’t even start using digital ID cards until 1996 — 13 years after Obama graduated.","\"This is a fake,\" said Robert Hornsby, a spokesman for the university, to PolitiFact. \"We didn't even have such IDs then.\"","Finally, Obama’s ID would not have said \"foreign student,\" and not just because Obama was born in Hawaii.

To be clear, many of these settings and features already existed in Facebook, but now Facebook is making them significantly clearer for the average user to find and use. It’s possible that Facebook would have had to do a lot of this work anyway in light of the new GDPR requirements that are coming into place in Europe. What today’s changes do not do is provide any indications that Facebook plans to do anything different in terms of what information it’s gathering and using to run its service, and its bigger, profitable business. (Indeed, even upcoming changes to its terms of service, which will include more clarity on Facebook’s data policy, will contain no changes in it, the company says: “These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data,” writes Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer.) We’ve seen a lot of people already downloading their Facebook data in the last week or so (without today’s update), and the impression you get is that they are generally coming away shocked by the amount of information that had been amassed through Facebook’s various apps across web and mobile. That in itself — combined with more scrutiny from regulators over how data is collected, used, and shared, and bigger changes that Facebook is making in terms of how it works with third-party apps that link into the Facebook platform (which CEO Mark Zuckberg announced last week) — will hopefully lead to more meaningful changes on that front. For the time being, however, the main idea here is that if you choose to stay and use Facebook, caveat emptor, and proceed armed with more control. Facebook highlights several areas where changes are being put in place: User controls. Facebook said that it has redesigned its settings menu for mobile, consolidating all of the primary controls on one screen. This is already a major change, given that previously they were spread across 20: a gating factor that would have meant it was hard to find what you were trying to change, or perhaps leading many to give up altogether. It’s also making it clear what can and cannot be shared with apps, specifically: “We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps,” writes Egan. The fact that it seems there were some out of date elements in the menus highlights that this might not have been Facebook’s biggest priority up to now. Privacy shortcuts. For those who don’t want to dive into their settings, Facebook said it is also going to put in a new item into its menu, directly linking users to privacy settings. Privacy Shortcuts, Facebook said, will come by way of a few taps and will let people add in two-factor authentication; composite access to what you’ve shared via Facebook with the option of deleting if you choose; controls for your ad settings, which will also include an explanation of how ads work on Facebook for those who might want to know more; and a link to help you control what and how you share on the site — that is, the setting of “public, friends only, and friends of friends.” Again, that control has been in place for years already at Facebook, but many don’t know how to access it, or what it means. Putting it a little more front and center might change that. Downloading and deleting Facebook data. The aim here is to make it easier for people to do both if they want. Access Your Information will be a secure link that people can use to collect this, and it will make it easier for people to do both. Will the ease and openness make it less likely that users will decide to leave Facebook altogether? That remains to be seen.

But make no mistake: there’s no such thing as “just” metadata. Metadata refers to almost everything except what you say or write: the identity of your contact, what time you contacted them, and even your location when you contacted them. This can paint a vivid picture of your habits, routines, and social circles. When combined with all of the other personal information and behavioral data available to Facebook, metadata collection is even more concerning.","Facebook has responded to media outrage with a \"fact check\" statement that Android users with Messenger installed had to opt in to Facebook logging their calls and texts. Generally, allowing users to opt in to a feature is generally much better from a privacy perspective than requiring them to opt out of a default. But the difference between opt-in and opt-out is not as simple as black and white. Misleading user interfaces, pushy pop-ups, and any number of variables can undermine users’ informed consent. Further, it’s hard for any one-time opt-in to meet the ethical bar of ongoing informed consent—something clearly needed when Facebook was not only accessing users’ call and text information but also storing it indefinitely.","Another important question to ask is about data minimization. It's a privacy best practice and an ethical imperative to not retain user data for any longer than absolutely necessary. The longer data is stored, the longer it is vulnerable to law enforcement requests, sharing with third parties, and other types of access or abuse. Why was this revealing user data stored for a moment beyond what was necessary for Facebook to provide services?","With all of these concerns in mind, Facebook's logging of user calls and texts presents a serious privacy problem.","Turn It Off","To check if this feature is on, and to turn it off, follow these steps.

What character on “Downton Abbey” would you be? What breed of dog is best for you? Some enormous percentage of Facebook’s 2.13 billion users must have seen Facebook friends sharing results of various online quizzes. They are sometimes annoying, senseless and a total waste of time. But they are irresistible. Besides, you’re only sharing the results with your family and friends. There’s nothing more innocent, right?","You are being psychographically profiled","Most people have heard of demographics – the term used by advertisers to slice up a market by age, gender, ethnicity and other variables to help them understand customers. In contrast, psychographics measure people’s personality, values, opinions, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. They help advertisers understand the way you act and who you are.","Historically, psychographic data were much harder to collect and act on than demographics. Today, Facebook is the world’s largest treasure trove of this data. Every day billions of people give the company huge amounts of information about their lives and dreams.","This isn’t a problem when the data are used ethically – like when a company shows you an ad for a pair of sunglasses you recently searched for.","However, it matters a lot when the data are used maliciously – segmenting society into disconnected echo chambers, and custom-crafting misleading messages to manipulate individuals’ opinions and actions.","In 2015, Facebook gave permission to academic researcher Aleksandr Kogan to develop a quiz of his own. Like other quizzes, his was able to capture all of your public information, including name, profile picture, age, gender and birthday; everything you’ve ever posted on your timeline; your entire friends list; all of your photos and the photos you’re tagged in; education history; hometown and current city; everything you’ve ever liked; and information about the device you’re using including your web browser and preferred language.","Kogan shared the data he collected with Cambridge Analytica, which was against Facebook policy – but apparently the company rarely enforced its rules.","Going shopping for impressionable users","Analyzing these data, Cambridge Analytica determined topics that would intrigue users, what kind of political messaging users were susceptible to, how to frame the messages, the content and tone that would motivate users, and how to get them to share it with others. It compiled a shopping list of traits that could be predicted about voters.","This is how Facebook users’ relationships with family and friends are being exploited for monetary profit, and for political gain.","Knowingly putting users at risk","Facebook could have done more to protect users.","The company encouraged developers to build apps for its platform. In return, the apps had access to vast amounts of user data – supposedly subject to those rules that were rarely enforced. But Facebook collected 30 percent of payments made through the apps, so its business interest made it want more apps, doing more things.","People who didn’t fill out quizzes were vulnerable, too. Facebook allowed companies like Cambridge Analytica to collect personal data of friends of quiz takers, without their knowledge or consent. Tens of millions of people’s data were harvested – and many more Facebook users could have been affected by other apps.","Changing culture and politics","That’s exactly what Facebook enabled Cambridge Analytica to do. In 2017, the company’s CEO boasted publicly that it was “able to use data to identify … very large quantities of persuadable voters … that could be influenced to vote for the Trump campaign.”","A healthy dose of skepticism","U.S. history is filled with stories of people sharing their thoughts in the public square. If interested, a passerby could come and listen, sharing in the experience of the narrative.","By combining psychographic profiling, analysis of big data and ad micro-targeting, public discourse in the U.S. has entered a new era. What used to be a public exchange of information and democratic dialogue is now a customized whisper campaign: Groups both ethical and malicious can divide Americans, whispering into the ear of each and every user, nudging them based on their fears and encouraging them to whisper to others who share those fears.","A Cambridge Analytica executive explained: “There are two fundamental human drivers … hopes and fears … and many of those are unspoken and even unconscious. You didn’t know that was a fear until you saw something that evoked that reaction from you. Our job is … to understand those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it’s all about emotion.”","The information that you shared on Facebook exposed your hopes and fears. That innocent-looking Facebook quiz isn’t so innocent.","The problem isn’t that this psychographic data were exploited at a massive scale. It’s that platforms like Facebook enable people’s data to be used in ways that take power away from voters and give it to data-analyzing campaigners.","Infographics show the classes and anxieties in the supposedly classless U.S. economy.","For those of us who follow politics, we’re used to commentators referring to the President’s low approval rating as a surprise given the U.S.'s “booming” economy. This seeming disconnect, however, should really prompt us to reconsider the measurements by which we assess the health of an economy. With a robust U.S. stock market and GDP and low unemployment figures, it’s easy to see why some think all is well. But looking at real U.S. wages, which have remained stagnant—and have, thus, in effect gone down given rising costs from inflation—a very different picture emerges. For the 1%, the economy is booming. For the rest of us, it’s hard to even know where we stand. A recent study by Porch (a home-improvement company) of blue-collar vs. white-collar workers shows how traditional categories are becoming less distinct—the study references \"new-collar\" workers, who require technical certifications but not college degrees. And a set of recent infographics from CreditLoan capturing the thoughts of America’s middle class as defined by the Pew Research Center shows how confused we are."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

Other companies dragging down the Dow include construction machinery manufacturer Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) which, being down by -2.75%, leads the pack in terms of percentage drop. Family consumer product company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) follow behind at -2.57% while manufacturing conglomerate 3M (MMM) comes third at -2.39%.","In addition to tech concerns, the Dow is likely suffering from fears over Donald Trump’s ‘trade war’, which comes after he implemented tariffs on both Chinese imports as well as global steel and aluminum imports this month. Reports state that the president implemented such tariffs in order to make the US more self-sufficient, though many countries see it as an affront to global trade and are considering retaliation.","The Dow has had a rocky 2018 so far since plummeting from a January high of 26,616.71 points – its highest ever. It has failed to maintain this upward trend, performing inconsistently through February and March, and currently sitting at a comparatively low 24,610.91 points.","If You Liked This Article Click To Share","Related Articles","Two weeks ago, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) acquired GitHub, the internet’s largest source code repository, and GitHub’s developers are already threatening to take their open-sourced projects elsewhere.

He knows if you have an American flag on your porch and a political sign in your yard. He knows what car you own, when you last voted and if you have cats. He is, in essence, the eyes and ears for the network led by industrial billionaires Charles and David Koch. And he may be the man who decides if Republicans keep their majority in the Senate this November.","As the president of the Koch-owned i360 data giant, Palmer has hundreds, if not thousands, of pieces of information on each and every American, gleaned through documents his team picks up from courthouses, auto dealerships and frequent shopper programs. No magazine subscription is too insignificant, no online purchase too small to note. All of it adds up, with the help of the nine PhDs on his staff, to predict voter behaviors and perhaps determine the outcome of races up and down the ballot.","“If someone came around and gave me $200 million today and 100 people from Google, we could not build what we’ve built in the last seven years, in a year or two,” Palmer said as he met with reporters Sunday at a retreat of 400 donors to the network led by the Koch brothers, known officially as Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce.","Every competitive Senate race—and a few more that aren’t—is using Palmer’s data to figure out which doors to knock on and which phones to ring. Based on that data, volunteers going door to door talking with voters even have their talking points updated in real time, not just based on the house but on which person living there answers the door.","“Data isn’t the end all, be all of a campaign. I mean, if you don’t have the right candidate, the right message, if the economy is collapsing, you know, there are a lot of externalities that are going to affect an election a lot more than having a sophisticated data operation,” said Palmer, who was the chief technology officer for John McCain’s 2008 campaign. “That said, when you’re looking at the last one or two or three points, data and analytics and tech operations are incredibly important. Guess what? Most elections are won or lost in that one or two or three points.”","The Republican National Committee has access to his tomes of data, which means GOP nominee Donald Trump, too, could read up on voters. Trump has, however, discounted the value of such research and instead prefers to lean on his gut. “It doesn’t seem like he has one,” Palmer said of Trump’s data operation.","To traditional candidates, the value of this research cannot be overstated. As much as Americans believe their vote is their own, they tend to fall into patterns that social scientists can spot from afar. It’s not as simple as whether someone shops at Whole Foods or subscribes to Martha Stewart’s magazine. Buying white wine or rosé can offer clues, as can the time shoppers go to the grocery store. Add in what someone is tweeting about, and it’s possible that Palmer’s team can more accurate predict your vote than your spouse.","And, yet, the Republican-allied Koch data machine is still likely behind what Democrats have built. Obama leaned on data science in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, and the Democratic-aligned NGP/VAN firm is one of the most sophisticated in the world when it comes to knowing every last shred of information about a person. Year over year, Democratic campaigns have fed into that system and kept it humming along with every imaginable piece of information.","“We’re probably still behind,” Palmer said of the data race between Republicans and Democrats. “Potentially some of our technology is newer or better,” but it’s not as well known as Democrats who are more familiar with the NGP/VAN platform.","These pinpoints of information have undeniable utility. Even so, several of Trump’s primary opponents leaned on i360’s data in their campaigns, yet were unable to match the real estate mogul’s brute force. It’s why Trump has publicly said he doesn’t plan on using the RNC’s data platform too much, if at all.","SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT","You May Like","Read More","Sign Up for Our Newsletters","Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know now on politics, health, money and more"],"isopubdate":""}

Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”","Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.","He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.","He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”","Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.","“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”","‘A majority of Facebook users’","Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.","That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.","The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.","Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.","Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.","It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it","Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.","Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.","Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”","Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.","During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.","See the full visual","While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.","“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”","It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.","The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.","While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.","“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.","If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.","The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.","Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.","He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.","“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”","‘They treated it like a PR exercise’","Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.","“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”","Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”","That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”","It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The Second War Powers Act of 1942 temporarily repealed that protection to assist in the roundup of Japanese-Americans for imprisonment in internment camps in California and six other states during the war. The Bureau previously has acknowledged that it provided neighborhood information on Japanese-Americans for that purpose, but it has maintained that it never provided \"microdata,\" meaning names and specific information about them, to other agencies.","A new study of U.S. Department of Commerce documents now shows that the Census Bureau complied with an August 4, 1943, request by Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau for the names and locations of all people of Japanese ancestry in the Washington, D.C., area, according to historian Margo Anderson of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and statistician William Seltzer of Fordham University in New York City. The records, however, do not indicate that the Bureau was asked for or divulged such information for Japanese-Americans in other parts of the country.","Anderson and Seltzer discovered in 2000 that the Census Bureau released block-by-block data during WW II that alerted officials to neighborhoods in California, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Idaho and Arkansas where Japanese-Americans were living. \"We had suggestive but not very conclusive evidence that they had also provided microdata for surveillance,\" Anderson says.","The Census Bureau had no records of such action, so the researchers turned to the records of the chief clerk of the Commerce Department, which received and had the authority to authorize interagency requests for census data under the Second War Powers Act. Anderson and Seltzer discovered copies of a memo from the secretary of the treasury (of which the Secret Service is part) to the secretary of commerce (who oversees the Census Bureau) requesting the data, and memos documenting that the Bureau had provided it [see image below].","The memos from the Bureau bear the initials \"JC,\" which the researchers identified as those of then-director, J.C. Capt.","\"What it suggests is that the statistical information was used at the microlevel for surveillance of civilian populations,\" Anderson says. She adds that she and Seltzer are reviewing Secret Service records to try to determine whether anyone on the list was actually under surveillance, which is still unclear.","\"The [new] evidence is convincing,\" says Kenneth Prewitt, Census Bureau director from 1998 to 2000 and now a professor of public policy at Columbia University, who issued a public apology in 2000 for the Bureau's release of neighborhood data during the war. \"At the time, available evidence (and Bureau lore) held that there had been no release of microdata,\" he says. \"That can no longer be said.\"","The newly revealed documents show that census officials released the information just seven days after it was requested. Given the red tape for which bureaucracies are famous, \"it leads us to believe this was a well-established path,\" Seltzer says, meaning such disclosure may have occurred repeatedly between March 1942, when legal protection of confidentiality was suspended, and the August 1943 request.","Anderson says that microdata would have been useful for what officials called the \"mopping up\" of potential Japanese-Americans who had eluded internment.","The researchers turned up references to five subsequent disclosure requests made by law enforcement or surveillance agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, none of which dealt with Japanese-Americans.","Lawmakers restored the confidentiality of census data in 1947.","Officially, Seltzer notes, the Secret Service made the 1943 request based on concerns of presidential safety stemming from an alleged March 1942 incident during which an American man of Japanese ancestry, while on a train from Los Angeles to the Manzanar internment camp in Owens Valley, Calif., told another passenger that they should have the \"guts\" to kill President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.","The incident occurred 17 months before the Secret Service request, during which time the man was hospitalized for schizophrenia and was therefore not an imminent threat, Seltzer says.","The disclosure, while legal at the time, was ethically dubious and may have implications for the 2010 census, the researchers write in a paper presented today at the annual meeting of the Population Association of America held in New York City. The U.S. has separate agencies for collecting statistical information about what people and businesses do, and for so-called administrative functions—taxation, regulation and investigation of those activities.","\"There has to be a firewall in some sense between those systems,\" Anderson says. If a company submits information ostensibly for documenting national economic growth but the data ends up in the antitrust division, \"the next time that census comes they're not going to get that information,\" she says.","Census data is routinely used to enforce the National Voting Rights Act and other policies, but not in a form that could be used to identify a particular person's race, sex, age, address or other information, says former director Prewitt. The legal confidentiality of census information dates to 1910, and in 1954 it became part of Title 13 of the U.S. Code, which specifies the scope and frequency of censuses.","\"The law is very different today\" than it was in 1943, says Christa Jones, chief of the Census Bureau's Office of Analysis and Executive Support. \"Anything that we release to any federal agency or any organization all of those data are reviewed,\" she says, to prevent disclosures of individual information.","The Census Bureau provided neighborhood data on Arab-Americans to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2002, but the information was already publicly available, Jones says. A provision in the controversial Patriot Act—passed after the 9/11 attacks and derided by critics as an erosion of privacy—gives agencies access to individualized survey data collected by colleges, including flight training programs.","The Census Bureau has improved its confidentiality practices considerably in the last six decades, former director Prewitt says. He notes that census data is an increasingly poor source of surveillance data compared with more detailed information available from credit card companies and even electronic tollbooths.","Nevertheless, he says, \"I think the Census Bureau has to bend over backwards to maintain the confidence and the trust of the public.\" Public suspicion—well-founded or not—could undermine the collection accurate census data, which is used by sociologists, economists and public health researchers, he says.","\"I'm sad to learn it,\" he says of the new discovery. \"It would be sadder yet to continue to deny that it happened, if, as now seems clear, it did happen. You cannot learn from and correct past mistakes unless you know about them.\"","Scientific American is part of Springer Nature, which owns or has commercial relations with thousands of scientific publications (many of them can be found at www.springernature.com/us).

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”","Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.","Profile","Cambridge Analytica: the key players","Alexander Nix, CEO","An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer.","Aleksandr Kogan, data miner","Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.","Steve Bannon, former board member","A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.","Robert Mercer, investor","Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.","Rebekah Mercer, investor","Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.","The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.","However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.","Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.","“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”","On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.","The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.","The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.","Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.","Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”","Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”","Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.","At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.","The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.","That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.","“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.","Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.","“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.","“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”","We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons","Christopher Wylie","A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.","Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.","Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.","Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.","Quick guide","How the story unfolded","In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.","Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.","She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.","While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.","The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.","But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.","Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.","Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.","Was this helpful?","Thank you for your feedback.","The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.","The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.","“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.","At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”","Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.","GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.","SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.","Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.","The Observer","The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

In Kerala, in a bizarre incident a few days ago, the State Police’s Hi-Tech cell has issued a notice to many bloggers, those who run Facebook posts and websites that they should not publish any sort of images or contents ridiculing the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The curious police order cited many provisions of Information Technology Act that prescribe penalties due to defamation and objectionable contents.","While the Left leaders make brouhaha on the so-called oppression of FoE and “intolerance” in India in the BJP regime, such rules of FoE evidently seem to not apply in the state where they are in power.","Meanwhile, on Monday evening, in Communist Party of India (Marxist)(CPI(M)) forte Kannur District, based on a complaint filed by the CPI (M) Mavilai Branch Committee Secretary, Police arrested a 20-year old youth Vaishnav for posting a satire or “ridiculing” or “defamatory” photos and comments about the Chief Minister in a local WhatsApp Group. The youth was arrested and later released on police station bail with a warning to behave properly.","This is really a bizarre incident. Arresting a person for a WhatsApp Group message or posting some cartoons or morphed photos of CPI(M) strongman Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is not a good sign for democracy. Across the Globe, in many democratic countries, politicians are subject to sarcasm and harsh criticisms and even bitter ridiculing. That goes with the territory.

It’s a threat to liberal democracy on a global scale,” David Kirkpatrick, author of “The Facebook Effect,” tells me in the latest edition of the POLITICO Money podcast, which dives into problems roiling the company including the disclosure that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, accessed the private data of 50 million Facebook users.","Story Continued Below","“Greed really entered into in recent years and Facebook has been swimming in so much dough that they came to live on their own fumes,” Kirkpatrick said. “They were more interested in growing their extraordinarily, unprecedentedly profitable business than they were in really sitting back and thinking about, ‘What does this really mean and what could go wrong?’”","THE LONG TERM OUTLOOK — For now, Kirkpatrick said, Facebook will survive. But as it faces legal probes and Congressional inquiries in the United States and investigations around the world, its long-term viability is in question.","“It will survive in the short-term partly because it is so profitable and they will continue to find ways to make it acceptable for users. And advertisers really have no alternatives as a place to go that is comparable for the ability to target customers,” he said. “But Facebook is essentially a 14-year old design that for all its evolution is still founded on the ideas of 14 years ago. So no, the answer is it will not survive long term.”","Ace POLITICO tech reporter Nancy Scola also joined the pod. And she doesn’t think the hope by some inside Facebook that the latest scandal will fade away in the short-attention span, hyper-crowded news environment will pan out.","Scola: “If I were them I wouldn’t bet on it. I think it’s had amazing staying power so far. I think what we are seeing is this latest scandal with Cambridge Analytica tapped into some real simmering resentment among users who were a little bit annoyed already with how their data was being used by the company and then amongst regulators.” Sign up for the podcast here, you will enjoy it I promise!","ZUCK TO THE HILL — Speaking of Facebook’s woes, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify before the House Energy and on April 12, POLITICO’s Ashley Gold reports here.","Overall, per Bloomberg, the FANG quartet and other top tech shares dropped 5.6 percent, the biggest tumble since 2014. Twitter led the declines with a 12 percent swoon, evidently driven by short-sellers. These stocks are the heart of the bull market and it seems like maybe they raced ahead a little too fast.","TAX CUTS PART II: A MESSAGING EXERCISE — Republicans are not going to be able to push through another round of tax cuts in 2018. They would need 60 votes in the Senate and they are not going to get it. The White House and GOP leadership understands this. But that doesn’t mean they won’t press the case, as POLITICO’s Rachel Bade and Burgess Everett report here:","“GOP leaders are weighing a series of votes to make last year’s temporary tax cuts for individuals permanent, according to Republicans in both chambers. The strategy would portray the party as the guardian of Americans’ paychecks, Republicans say, and buoy the GOP during a brutal election year.","“Republicans argue they win regardless of whether it culminates with a Rose Garden ceremony: Either Democrats support the legislation, giving the GOP a major legislative accomplishment in their scramble to save their majorities. Or, more likely, Democrats block the bill — allowing Republicans to paint them as opponents of the middle class.”","MM asked a senior White House official this week if they thought there was any chance in 2018 for another big tax bill to pass: “No way. Not at all. But it’s going to be a great messaging opportunity for us.”","“While the headline of some of the regional manufacturing surveys was hit by uncertainty over tariffs, plans for future investment appear to have been unscathed in March. This may imply that tax benefits are outweighing uncertainties over policy risk. It may also provide further evidence of the capex cycle that was well underway prior to the enactment of tax cuts”","POLITICO Space is our new, free weekly briefing on the policies and personalities shaping the second space age in Washington and beyond.

The highly sensitive debate has consumed the attention of top officials at both agencies. At stake is the final say over IRS regulations — and the implementation of the Republicans' tax law.” Read more.","WHAT ZUCKERBERG SHOULD SAY — POLITICO’s Nancy Scola and Steven Overly: “Practice, practice, practice. Accept that congressional hearings are a form of theater. And don’t show up as the arrogant jerk from ‘The Social Network.’","“That’s among the advice that crisis communications experts in Washington are offering as Mark Zuckerberg awaits his expected testimony on Capitol Hill about the Cambridge Analytica scandal — the kind of ritual D.C. flogging that is far from his usual comfort zone.” Read more.","STATES TO SUE OVER CENSUS QUESTION — POLITICO’s Brent D. Griffiths, Andrew Restuccia and Cristiano Lima: “A collection of states started preparing legal actions against the Trump administration on Tuesday just hours after the Commerce Department announced that it would include a controversial question about citizenship status in the 2020 U.S. Census — a move that could have far-reaching effects on immigrants and the political landscape.","“The decision to include the question sparked a wave of backlash from congressional Democrats and civil rights groups, and the White House on Tuesday was pressed to defend the move. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders disputed claims that the revamped census could see a drop in response rates from immigrants, who may fear the information could lead to their deportation, disproportionately affecting their ability to attain federal resources” Read more.","REMINGTON GOES BUST — Reuters BreakingViews’ Rob Cox: “A day after March for Our Lives, Remington went bust.

At his insistence, the two countries launched talks last year to renegotiate the pact. … The changes to the KORUS agreement include a provision that will double to 50,000 the number of cars each U.S. manufacturer can export to South Korea without having to meet the country’s more stringent safety standards. Others address additional auto regulatory barriers” Read more.","MARKETS","TECH COMPANIES DRAG DOWN MARKETS. AGAIN. — NYT’s Matt Phillips: “Technology stocks helped propel the nine-year bull market. Optimistic investors piled into the shares, hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media, autonomous driving, video streaming and artificial intelligence. Now, that confidence is evaporating.","LESSONS FROM STOCK CORRECTIONS PAST — Bloomberg’s Lu Wang, Sarah Ponczek and Elena Popina: “Remember the last time stocks fell so hard? You probably don’t, and that’s making it all seem a little harsher than it is. It’s a fact of the life of the mind -- things always seem worse in the present. In fact, they’re not. In this bull market alone there’s been five other corrections like this one, and it’s taken around seven months on average for equities to climb out of their hole, data compiled by Bloomberg show.","“Based on that path, the current jitters won’t be fully eradicated until August.

The head of the government’s ethics agency had told a Democratic House member that White House lawyers had acknowledged they ‘had already begun the process’ of looking into possible ethics and legal issues spawned by the loans. Kushner met last year with executives from the two companies that made the loans to Kushner Cos.","“Even as White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders firmly denied any formal investigation into Kushner, she acknowledged that the White House Counsel’s office often plays a role in checking whether ethics guidelines have been met by administration officials. ‘While the White House Counsel’s office does follow-up with staff to assist with compliance with various ethics standards, it is not probing whether Kushner violated the law,’ Sanders said.” Read more.","CONSUMER CONFIDENCE DOWN IN MARCH — WSJ’s Sarah Chaney: “U.S. consumer confidence fell in March, dragged down by consumers’ perception of current and future economic conditions in light of recent stock-market gyrations.","“The Conference Board said Tuesday its measure of U.S. consumer confidence decreased to 127.7 in March from an 18-year high of 130.0 in February. … This month, the present situation index fell to 159.9 from 161.2 in February; the expectations index dropped to 106.2 in March from 109.2 last month.” Read more.","DEUTSCHE BANK STARTS LOOKING AT SUCCESSORS — FT’s Martin Arnold, Patrick Jenkins and Olaf Storbeck: “Deutsche Bank has started an informal process to find a successor for chief executive John Cryan amid mounting boardroom unrest and shareholder discontent over the bank’s performance ahead of its annual meeting in May.

At least for now.","Joining Google parent company Alphabet and Facebook, Twitter revealed Monday its plans to ban some cryptocurrency-related ads in a bid to decrease fraud and deception on the site. Namely, the social media company plans to prohibit initial coin offerings and token sales, and it plans to only show ads of exchanges or wallets provided by companies listed on major stock exchanges.","There is a logic to focusing on exchanges from public firms. Companies on a major stock exchange are often subject to tougher transparency rules, giving more insight into the workings of a company they are putting their faith in.","The ban will roll out Tuesday, and become fully enforceable for all advertisers within a month.","“We are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community. As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency. Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally,” a Twitter spokesperson said. “We will continue to iterate and improve upon this policy as the industry evolves.”","Still, the self regulation for social media giants likely won’t stop there. Aside from ads, social media firms like Twitter will have the difficult task of addressing fake cryptocurrency news on their own platforms. And in a space as young as this, there is no shortage. Earlier this year, an account claiming to be Elon Musk, for instance, managed scamming users out of thousands of dollars worth of Ethereum.

After making Kogan and Cambridge Analytica promise to delete the data the app had gathered, Facebook received reports (from sources they would not identify) which claimed that not all the data had been deleted – which led the social media giant to delete Cambridge Analytica and parent company SCL’s accounts.","“By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.” –Facebook","Of note, Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz and Ben Carson during the 2016 election before contracting with the Trump campaign. Cruz stopped using CA after their data modeling failed to identify likely supporters.","In response to the ban, Edward Snowden fired off two tweets on Saturday criticizing Facebook, and claimed social media companies were simply “surveillance companies” who engaged in a “successful deception” by rebranding themselves.","Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post. They are not victims. They are accomplices. https://t.co/mRkRKxsBcw","Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as “surveillance companies.” Their rebranding as “social media” is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.","Snowden isn’t the first big name to call out Silicon Valley companies over their data collection and monitoring practices, or their notorious intersection with the U.S. Government.","In his 2014 book: When Google Met WikiLeaks, Julian Assange describes Google’s close relationship with the NSA and the Pentagon.","Around the same time, Google was becoming involved in a program known as the “Enduring Security Framework” (ESF), which entailed the sharing of information between Silicon Valley tech companies and Pentagon-affiliated agencies “at network speed.” Emails obtained in 2014 under Freedom of Information requests show Schmidt and his fellow Googler Sergey Brin corresponding on first-name terms with NSA chief General Keith Alexander about ESF Reportage on the emails focused on the familiarity in the correspondence: “General Keith . . . so great to see you . . . !” Schmidt wrote.

PRISM’s existence was leaked by Edward Snowden before he entered into ongoing asylum in Moscow.

And Trump’s campaign was masterful at it, in large part thanks to Cambridge Analytica, the data-targeting team that worked to make sure Trump made it to the White House.","While Facebook, Twitter, and Google are now under scrutiny—with Congress and the FBI investigating how Kremlin-backed accounts spread election ads on various online platforms—it’s worth considering how the Trump camp used social networks as well. We already know that Donald Trump Jr. solicited information from Russians in possible violation of election law, but we don’t know the extent of any potential such collusion.

The company claims to have “up to 5,000 data points on over 230 million American voters,” which it uses to create psychological profiles to “effectively engage and persuade voters using specially tailored language and visual ad combinations,” that appeal to each person on an emotional level.","That psychological data-modeling sparked the interest of David Carroll, a professor at Parsons School of Design who studies media, data-targeting, and campaigns. Carroll wanted to see exactly what data the company had been using to micro-target voters in the U.S. The United Kingdom has a data protection law that allows people to request their own personal data from any company that holds such information. Carroll put in a request to see if Cambridge Analytica had been shipping his information back to SCL in London. And to his surprise, he did get some of his personal data back.","Carroll learned that the company had given him scores on a scale of 1 to 10 on certain hot button political categories, like a “gun rights importance rank.” Based on these scores, he was ultimately listed as “unlikely” to vote Republican. However interesting this disclosure was, it wasn’t all that Carroll wanted to know.","Advertisement","Under Britain’s Data Protection Act, a subject can ask where a company gets such personal data, why the data is being processed, and who the data is being shared with. So, Carroll teamed up with Ravi Naik, a British solicitor who is pushing the case further.","Carroll said that Cambridge Analytica failed to provide all of the information it was required to by law. He and Naik have started to file pre-trial actions in preparation for a potential lawsuit, which could reveal more information about how voters were micro-targeted and where the Trump campaign got its data. The group is currently raising money to help cover the cost of possible forthcoming legal bills.","Such insight into the Trump data apparatus would help Americans understand how Republicans were able to instrumentalize Facebook and other data-driven ad platforms to help win the election. It would also potentially uncover how Cambridge Analytica, and thus Trump’s campaign, got its hands on the personal data of millions of voters. That’s important, not just because it would be useful to know how social media platforms can be leveraged to micro target voters based on individuated psychological profiles, but also because Cambridge Analytica is not your average data-targeting firm.","Until recently, former Trump campaign chief and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon was on the board of Cambridge Analyitica. The company’s primary financier is Robert Mercer, the secretive billionaire CEO of the New York investment firm Renaissance Technologies, who is also one of the main funders of Bannon’s Breitbart News. The family has also funded Milo Yiannopoulos, the Cato Institute, and the Heritage Foundation. And Mercer was the largest donor to Trump-backing Super PACs during the election, period. In other words, the Cambridge Analytica data operation has deep ties into the far reaches of the far right. Understanding this particular data-driven online campaign could ultimately prove useful, both to a curious public and to anyone investigating how social media companies were potentially manipulated to sway the U.S. election.","Facebook, Twitter, and Google are currently grappling with how they will explain to Congress the fact that Russian government linked groups appear to have used their ad targeting and other social media tools to attempt to sway U.S. voters and circulate misinformation. These investigators would be wise to pay close attention to whatever Carroll’s case might also be able to uncover."],"isopubdate":""}

The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States.","The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.","Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015.","The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted.","“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment.","The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.","Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the company’s systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election.","The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers.

Nix allegedly asked the WikiLeaks founder whether he could assist in releasing thousands of emails that had gone missing on a private server that had been used by Hillary Clinton. Assange confirmed the contact but said the offer was rejected.","The news prompted a top former campaign official, Michael Glassner, who was executive director of the Trump election campaign, to minimise the role Cambridge Analytica played in electing Trump, despite the fact that it paid Cambridge Analytica millions of dollars in fees.","In a statement on Wednesday, Glassner said that the Trump campaign relied on voter data owned by the Republican National Committee to help elect the president.","“Any claims that voter data from any other source played a key role in the victory are false,” he said.","But that claim is contradicted by a detailed description of the company’s role in the 2016 election given in May by a senior Cambridge Analytica executive.","Speaking at a conference in Germany, Molly Schweickert, the head of digital at Cambridge Analytica, said that Cambridge Analytica models, which melded the company’s own massive database and new voter surveys, were instrumental in day-to-day campaign decisions, including in helping determine Trump’s travel schedule.","The company’s models also helped drive decisions on advertising and how to reach out to financial donors.","Schweickert said Cambridge Analytica started working with the Trump campaign in June 2016.","“It became obvious that a sophisticated data apparatus would be needed to combat the years of infrastructure and experience the Clinton campaign had been building up,” she said.","One of the company’s strategies was to work in “collaboration” with news publishers like Politico, the political news website, which Schweickert said helped the company target a political ad about the Clinton Foundation to readers in key battleground states.","“We knew we would be showing this to the right individuals,” Schweickert said.","In another case, in the late stages of the November election, Schweickert said the company acquired data on voters who voted early – data it collected from local counties and states – and linked the information to individual Facebook profiles.","This helped Cambridge Analytica determine whether people had been exposed to certain political advertisements, and whether those people had turned in their early voting ballots, helping them to predict the outcome of the election.","When asked by a German audience member whether this was legal, given privacy rules in Europe that would “probably” make the activity illegal in Germany, Schweickert responded: “It’s a very different sort of data privacy culture.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-24"}

It might be a wake-up call. - The Washington Post","text":["Here’s how to download all your data from Facebook. It might be a wake-up call.","Facebook, my mother will be proud to know, believes that my friends and I are part of the “Established Adult Life” peer group. In fact, Facebook knows a lot about how I’ve grown over the past decade: In 2007, Facebook knew I was declining invitations to college graduation parties and posting screen shots of pictures from Cute Overload to my wall. In 2018, Facebook knows I’ve clicked on 17 ads since late January for adult-looking work wear, because I can’t wear flannels and pants to work forever. And I’ve clicked on more than a dozen ads for local real estate listings that I will never be able to afford.","As that sinks in, some are choosing to quit the platform. Others are digging into just what it is Facebook knows about them. As it turns out, there’s a pretty easy way to find that out in one, giant file.","(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post/iStock)","In the Facebook settings for your account — right below the link to deactivate it — there’s an option to download a copy of all your Facebook data. The file can be a creepy wake-up call: All those years of browsing the News Feed, and sharing selfies, engagements and birthday wishes on Facebook have taught the company quite a lot about you. You, the user, are part of the reason that Facebook has become so good at targeting ads. You’re giving them everything they need to do it.","Here’s a link that will take you right to the settings page, if you’re logged in to your account. One there, click on the link to download your archive, and follow the prompts:","Image/Facebook","Once you request it, Facebook will send two emails: The first acknowledges that a request was made, and the other gives you a link to get the file when it’s ready. The size of your file — and therefore the time it takes for Facebook to create it — will vary.","I downloaded my own file over the weekend. I expected relatively limited results for a frequent Facebook visitor. Although I’ve been on the platform since 2004, I don’t use the Facebook app on my phone, I keep Messenger on my phone only for the short periods of time when I absolutely need it, and I manually delete the categories that get listed automatically under my ad preferences — once every few months.","It was still a little unsettling to scroll through some of the results, particularly my recent history of interacting with ads — information that Facebook says it retains for only a certain period of time. I apparently clicked on the same ad for a Boden dress three times (I didn’t buy it). I clicked on another, for a clearly dubious site, promising to explain to me “Why Do Some Women Age Faster Than Others?”","Others, including some of my friends, learned from the file that Facebook knew a lot more about them than they thought. One Facebook friend, whom I’ll keep anonymous, shared with me some of his results. Facebook has his contact list and what appears to be a pretty comprehensive record of every phone call he made, and text he sent, from a several month period in 2015 and 2016.","As Ars Technica reported, Facebook needs permission to collect information like this from your phone when you install the Facebook app. But some Android users may have granted that permission without realizing it, before Android tweaked how its permissions work.","Facebook responded to Ars Technica in a “fact check” blog post that denies it has collected call and SMS history from anyone without their permission. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the post says.

Over the last 18 months, they have come under fire for being a service that rampantly spread fake news without any checks and balances applied to their service and did not protect their customer’s data from being hijacked. Some have even gone as far as to accuse them of having an impact on the 2016 presidential election.","Then last week the news that Cambridge Analytica abused Facebook in onerous ways has put Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the headlights of US and EU officials and has brought Facebook’s leadership under great pressure to clean up their act, or they will come under stiff regulation from US and EU legislative bodies very soon.","In talking to users of Facebook, I am starting to understand their frustrations with this social media service, but I also sense that it still provides real value to them in the way they can connect with family and friends and get legitimate information and even ads that are actually useful to them. However, the thing I keep hearing from these discussions is that they are losing faith in Facebook and are not sure they can trust them to protect them from nefarious actors who prey on them in multiple ways.","If you look deeply at Facebook’s business model, the culprit, so to speak, that allows this unrestrained flow of information is the fact that Facebook is ad driven. Everything they do is tied to the ways they can use data collected through their users to serve them targeted ads. This is at the heart of Facebook’s overall financial growth and keeps them profitable.","In my conversations with Facebook and some Twitter users, there is one theme that keeps coming up, and that is that they want to have these connections with friends and family and that they understand ads are the way this service is free to them. However, what they want are these services to protect their privacy and keep them from being exploited or misused by their data being harvested and used beyond a proper ad model they are willing to accept.","In a recent insider post about Apple’s purchase of Texture, I pointed out that the acquisition of this magazine service is tied to magazines that are trusted sources. In most cases, the magazines use highly accepted journalistic practices, and people trust what they read in them. I called Texture a “Safe Haven” for content and that Apple now has a type of service that will be important to their customers and extends the content reach of their ecosystem.","The idea of trusted content or sources is really important in this day of fake news. People are tired of being duped and are willing to pay for a trusted service like the one Texture delivers for $9.99 a month that gives them access to over 200 magazines.","Given what Facebook is going through and has had to deal with, perhaps it is time that they offer what I call a “trusted” or Safe Haven version of Facebook and do it as a subscription service. I realize this idea has been kicking around most likely inside Facebook as well as with other parties who look at Facebook’s future. But given what happened recently with Cambridge Analytica, and the fact that it does not seem Facebook really knows how to deal with protecting our data given their ad-based business model, I am beginning to think that millions of people may be willing to actually pay for an ad based version of Facebook if it does not use their data for ads and ad targeting.","So how much would a user cost Facebook if they had to charge them? Chris Wilson, Director of Data Journalism at Time Magazine answers this question in a recent post, and I share the relevant part of this article below:","“So how much would this cost users? Facebook estimates that it pulled down $20.21 in revenue per active user worldwide last year, for a total of $40.65 billion. That sum amply covered the $20.45 billion the company paid in costs and expenses. After taxes, Facebook posted $15.92 billion in profits. That per-user revenue was considerably higher in the U.S. and Canada, where a more developed and monetized audience netted $84.41 per user. That’s still less than what you might pay for Netflix or HBO, though perhaps more than many of Facebook’s 2 billion monthly users would be willing to shell out.","But even if subscriptions were prorated by market, and even if a privacy-positive network were to grow to Facebook-sized proportions, it would take less than $84.41 a month in the U.S. and Canada to turn a healthy profit. The trouble with relying on a lot of ads is that you need to store a lot of content. These days, that includes lots of video, with its lucrative “pre-roll” and “mid-roll” ads. To keep up with demand, Facebook has aggressively tried to get users and companies to post their content directly on the social network. When you get into the business of hosting large amounts of original content, however, your bill for storing and indexing rises quickly. Facebook doesn’t disclose its exact obligation for running massive warehouses around the world, but it’s safe to assume it’s a fair portion of its $20 billion in expenses. Without the burden of being a major content platform or pouring money into sophisticated algorithms to serve ads based on rigorous analysis of a person’s profile, we can estimate that $75 a year would cover the operating costs and generate a healthy profit.”","If Mr. Wilson’s math is correct, I monthly subscription price of $6.25 that would serve a user no adds but give them the valued connections to friends, family, and information they specifically want would still net Facebook a healthy profit.\nAs the Time article points out, Facebook would have to drastically change their business model and cut the costs of hosting video intensive ads for this to work. But I have to believe that for a significant portion of users, especially in the US, Canada and much of the EU, a subscription-based Facebook could be acceptable.","If I were going to pay a subscription fee for Facebook, here is what I would want in that service:","1-Facebook would not serve me any ads of any type and not use any of my personal dates for this purpose or share that data with advertisers even if it was to be used for market research purposes of any advertiser. My data is may data and not for Facebook to use in any way other than to serve me.","2-I would want a secure connection to my friends and family and be assured that I have complete control of what I can send them and what they can see as part of this service. More importantly, Facebook is not profiling me or my friends and family and just allowing me to communicate with them and share stuff of interest to me in a secure, safe haven environment.","3-I would want the Facebook messaging service to be encrypted and as secure as Apple’s current messaging service. While Facebook is the medium for making these connections, I do not want them to store that data or have any access to my messages for any purpose.","4-I would be open to them curating the kind of information I want to see based on my preferences. I am willing to let them know I like Golden Retrievers and stories about dogs. I am ok that they know I am a scuba diver and send me stories about scuba diving. But I would set the preferences for what type of information I am interested in and, using AI and machine learning, check articles related to my interest to make sure they are legitimate and not based on fake news.","This is the minimum I would want in a Facebook subscription that I pay for monthly.","Given Facebook’s business model today, I doubt that they would create this kind of service for their users, even if millions of us want this type of privacy and control of Facebook. However, if they don’t deliver this type of true secure safe haven for existing Facebook users, give us more control of our data, make sure our data is truly secure and protect us from fake news, millions upon millions of users will #deletefacebook and look for some other type of social media platform like the one I describe above and opt for this type of social media service instead.","Tim Bajarin","Tim Bajarin is the President of Creative Strategies, Inc.

Photo: Reuters","New Delhi: Data drives all that we do”. That is how Cambridge Analytica, the analytics and marketing firm that worked for the Trump presidential campaign in 2016, describes itself on its website. Ironically, it is this very data that has brought the UK-based firm to the centre of controversy. The company allegedly used data harvested from about 50 million Facebook users to target US voters ahead of the presidential race. Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have been reported in several detailed accounts by the media, setting off a furious debate about the ethical implications of the firm’s so-called psychographic modelling techniques.","Specifically, Cambridge Analytica is accused of buying profile data of millions of Americans’ from researcher Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge collected user data from Facebook by telling them that he was collecting it strictly for academic purposes. Kogan thus gained access to data from not only Facebook users who agreed to give their information to Kogan’s app, but according to the Guardian, also got permission to harvest data on all their Facebook friends.","Cambridge Analytica was set up in 2013 as an offshoot of parent company called Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL Group), which offers similar services around the world. According to its website, SCL has influenced elections in Italy, Latvia, Ukraine, Albania, Romania, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Mauritius, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, Colombia, Antigua, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, St. Kitts & Nevis, and Trinidad & Tobago. According to reports in the Guardian, Cambridge Analytica’s founder and currently suspended CEO, Alexander Nix said it had been set up “to address the vacuum in the US Republican political market” that became evident when Mitt Romney was defeated in the 2012 presidential election.","The company is part of the SCL Group that provides data, analytics and strategy to governments and military organizations worldwide. Nix, the 42-year-old Eton-educated protagonist joined SCL in 2003 after studying at Manchester University and working in corporate finance.","Nix set up Cambridge Analytica, an offshoot in 2013, with funding from Republican donor Robert Mercer. The managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division is Mark Turnbull, who spent 18 years at the communications firm Bell Pottinger before joining SCL.","What exactly does Cambridge Analytica do? A blog post on Medium by Frederike Kaltheuner explains that the company does more than simply predicting users’ interests or future behaviour—it builds psychometric profiles. Psychometrics is a field of psychology that is devoted to measuring personality traits, aptitudes, and abilities. Inferring psychometric profiles means learning information about an individual that previously could only be learned through the results of specifically designed tests and questionnaires: how neurotic you are, how open you are to new experiences or whether you are contentious. And so on.","This sinister ability relies on mountains of data that the company, through Kogan, gathered between 2013 and 2015. Few users, as mentioned before, were aware they were being profiled in this way.","Using a personality profiling methodology, the company—formed by high-powered right-wing investors for just this purpose—began offering its profiling system to dozens of political campaigns.","Cambridge Analytica was able to procure this data in the first place thanks to a loophole in Facebook’s API, since closed, that allowed third-party developers to collect data not only from users of their apps but from all of the people in those users’ friends network on Facebook. This access came with the stipulation that such data couldn’t be marketed or sold—a rule Cambridge Analytica promptly violated.","What is more worrying is that the company tends to describe its capabilities in grandiose language, touting its expertise at “psychological warfare” and “influence operations.” It has long claimed that its sophisticated understanding of human psychology helps it target and persuade people of its clients’ preferred message.","Meanwhile, Channel 4 News in the UK posted a video in which Cambridge Analytica CEO Nix is seen talking about entrapment as a way to win campaigns. Channel 4’s videos include a series of meetings at London hotels over four months between November 2017 and January 2018. The videos at times include Nix as well as Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica political global, and Alex Tayler, chief data officer. As these reports surfaced, the company board suspended Nix, pending an investigation.","Currently, Cambridge Analytica in the UK is facing investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign.","Interestingly, Cambridge Analytica and SCL’s impact was not just limited to the US and Britain. It is believed that Cambridge Analytica was involved in past Indian elections, and has made efforts to reach out to both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, ahead of the 2019 general elections. Here is a detailed piece on SCL’s activities in India.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether it will be asked to join Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the world of advertising. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age—a “Math Man,” he puts it.","People who have worked closely with Nix, said it is his desire to push boundaries that has backfired. One of these people said: “He managed to take the opportunity of a lifetime for his company . . . and his hubris and arrogance, wanting people to think of him as a secret agent, managed to destroy it all”."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-29"}

Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said.","The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said.","\"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\"","An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook.","In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\"","Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it – and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica.","Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America — 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency.","The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors.","Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained.","The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform.","Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."],"isopubdate":""}

Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn’t authorized to have that information.

The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the “public prominence” of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an “unacceptable violation of trust” and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties “responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.”","In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied any wrongdoing. He said the parent company’s SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake “a large scale research project in the US,” but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan’s company. For the “avoidance of doubt,” the spokesman said, none of Kogan’s data was used in Cambridge Analytica’s 2016 election work.","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.

Ted Cruz and President Trump's 2016 campaign. The idea was to put 2016 political advertising on steroids by targeting certain people based on very specific people.","Here's how it happened: In 2014, a company called Global Science Research (GSR) used Facebook to distribute a personality quiz to analyze whether users were extroverted or neurotic. The company said it was doing it just for research purposes, but it actually harvested the psychological data from all the users and -- with their permission -- got access to some data on their Facebook friends.","\"It scaled really quickly. We spent over $1 million on it, so it wasn't cheap but in terms of the amount of data that was collected, and the quality of that data, it was a rare example of where something was fast, relatively cheap, but high-quality, \" Wylie said.","\"I take a share of responsibility in this because I was the research director and I worked on this program so I'm going to start by saying I'm taking responsibility and I'm owning up,\" Wylie said. \"In terms of who else needs to take responsibility: Cambridge Analytica -- it funded the program, it approved the program -- as an entity this is what ultimately became the foundation of what Cambridge Analytica is.\"","Wylie added: \"Last week I offered to help Facebook and work with Facebook and their lawyers confirmed that they wanted to work in a collaborative manner -- when all of this came out I got banned [from Facebook] -- they decided that actually the whistleblower is the person they want to apparently go after.\"","Facebook said the use of the data was unauthorized. Since 2015, the company has banned third-party developers from collecting data on users friends.","But Facebook's critics say the company should have done more. David Carroll, who has filed a lawsuit to figure out exactly what information was used, believes the social media giant should bear some responsibility.","\"If they did let data get collected in an illicit manner and didn't adequately protect it when they learned how it was used, then yes, they are responsible. That's the deal they make with us, that they protect our data in order for us to use the service,\" Carroll said.","The more information a political campaign knows about you, the more they can target ads. They know your personality and they know your interests. They know your religion and how strongly you believe it, and they can target ads against those beliefs.","Users don't need to worry that their personal information will be hacked, or your bank information stolen, but Wylie has said that this information was used to create ads that turned people against each other and they were deliberately divisive."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

That’s partly because the data apps ask for is largely intangible and invisible, as well as vague rather than specific.","What’s more, it doesn’t seem to take much to get us to give away other people’s data in return for very little, with one study finding 98% of MIT students would give away their friends’ emails when promised free pizza.","Other studies have shown that collaborating in folders on cloud services, such as Google Drive, can result in privacy losses that are 39% higher due collaborators installing third-party apps you wouldn’t choose to install yourself. Facebook’s data download tool poses another risk in that once the data is taken out of Facebook it becomes even easier to copy and distribute.","This shift from personal to interdependent online privacy reliant on our friends, family and colleagues is a seismic one for the privacy agenda.","How much data are we talking about?","With more than 3.5 million apps on Google Play alone, the collection of data from our friends via back-door methods is more common than we might think. The back-door opens when you press “accept” to permissions to give access to your contacts when installing an app.","Then the data harvesting machinery begins its work – often in perpetuity, and without us knowing or understanding what will be done with it. More importantly, our friends never agreed to us giving away their data. And we have a lot of friends’ data to harvest.","The average Australian has 234 Facebook friends. Large-scale data collection is easy in an interconnected world when each person who signs up for an app has 234 friends, and each of them has 234 and, so on. That’s how Cambridge Analytica was apparently able to collect information on up to 50 million users, with permission from just 270,000.","Add to that the fact that the average person uses nine different apps on a daily basis. Once installed, some of these apps can harvest data on a daily basis without your friends knowing and 70% of apps share it with third parties.","We’re more likely to refuse data requests that are specific","Around 60% of us never, or only occasionally, review the privacy policy and permissions requested by an app before downloading. And in our own research conducted with a sample of 287 London business students, 96% of participants failed to realise the scope of all the information they were giving away.","However, this can be changed by making a data request more specific – for example, by separating out “contacts” from “photos”. When we asked participants if they had the right to give all the data on their phone, 95% said yes. But when they focused on just contacts, this decreased to 80%.","We can take this further with a thought experiment. Imagine if an app asked you for your “contacts, including your grandmother’s phone number and your daughter’s photos”. Would you be more likely to say no? The reality of what you are actually giving away in these consent agreements becomes more apparent with a specific request.","The silver lining is more vigilance","This new reality not only threatens moral codes and friendships, but can cause harm from hidden viruses, malware, spyware or adware. We may also be subject to prosecution as in a recent German case in which a judge ruled that giving away your friend’s data on Whatsapp without their permission was wrong.","Although company policies on privacy can help, these are difficult to police. Facebook’s “platform policy” at the time the Cambridge Analytica data was harvested only allowed the collection of friends’ data to improve the user experience of an app, while preventing it from being sold on or used for advertising. But this puts a huge burden on companies to police, investigate and enforce these policies. It’s a task few can afford, and even a company the size of Facebook failed.","The silver lining to the Cambridge Analytica case is that more and more people are recognising that the idea of “free” digital services is an illusion. The price we pay is not only our own privacy, but the privacy of our friends, family and colleagues.","You might also like","Normal negative emotions are actually growth promoting and essential for human development and adaptation.

When asked by CNN’s Laurie Seagall why shouldn’t Facebook be regulated on Wednesday night, Zuckerberg said he was open to the idea. Or, at least, he didn’t immediately shut down the idea.","“I’m actually not sure we shouldn’t be regulated,” he said. “You know, I think in general technology is an increasingly important trend in the world and I actually think the question is more what’s the right regulation rather than ‘yes’ or ‘no’ should it be regulated.”","“If you look at how much regulation there is around advertising on TV, in print, you know it’s just not clear why there should be less on the internet,” Zuckerberg continued. “You should have the same level of transparency required.”","Advertisement","As Facebook has lurched from crisis to crisis over the past year, tech regulation has become the elephant in the room. During Facebook, Twitter, and Google’s marathon testimony session in front of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees last November, regulation was mentioned by both Republicans and Democrats, pointing to at least some bipartisan consensus on Silicon Valley.","“Political ads are regulated but in social media it’s pretty much the Wild West,” Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC) said at the time. “I’m convinced now that self-regulation is not going to work, we’re going to have to give these companies some structure.”","However, it’s important to take Zuckerberg’s sudden openness to that regulation with a grain of salt. Immediately after saying he was open to the idea of regulation, Zuckerberg proceed to dismiss most of Washington’s concerns, launching into an explanation of how Facebook “has already started rolling out ad transparency tools that accomplish most of the things that are in all the bills that people are talking about today,” and suggesting that there was no need for anyone else to get involved. Facebook, in other words, was perfectly capable of self-regulating.","Officials overseas aren’t waiting for that to happen. Last year, the European Union introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which restricts how companies collect and store personal data, forcing Facebook to change its tone: ahead of the launch, Facebook launched a new privacy center, which Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said gave the company “a very good foundation to meet all the requirements of the G.D.P.R. and spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy.”","It’s likely that Facebook will face some financial costs if it agrees to Washington’s requests for more stringent regulation. However, bearing in mind Facebook has lost approximately $60 billion in stock value since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, that may be a justifiable cost."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-22"}

Damian Collins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media & Sport Committee, said on Monday that he “will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from [Facebook] appear to give evidence” before that body.","On Tuesday morning it was announced that a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s HQ has been requested by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) following the news of the apparent data breach, and in the wake of an ongoing Channel 4 investigation apparently showing the firm’s senior management claiming expertise in questionable tactics – including “honeytraps” and bribery – on the part of its political clients.

These new stories, backed by Wylie’s account and internal documents, followed years of reporting by The Guardianand The Intercept about the possible problem.","The details could seem Byzantine. Aleksandr Kogan, then a Cambridge academic, founded a company, Global Science Research, and immediately took on a major client, Strategic Communication Laboratories, which eventually gave birth to Cambridge Analytica. (Steve Bannon, an adviser to the company and a former senior adviser to Trump, reportedly picked the name.)","The promise of Kogan’s company was that they could build psychological profiles of vast numbers of people by using Facebook data. Those profiles, in turn, might be useful to tune the political messages that Cambridge Analytica sent to potential voters. Perhaps a certain kind of message might appeal more to extroverts, or narcissists, or agreeable people.","To gather that data, the Times reports, Kogan hired workers through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to install a Facebook app in their accounts. The app, built by Global Science Research, requested an unusual (but not unheard-of) amount of data about users themselves and their friends. That’s how 270,000 Turkers ended up yielding 30 million profiles of American Facebook users that could be matched with other data sets.","From the current reporting, it seems that Kogan violated Facebook’s terms of service in saying he was using the data for academic research, but then selling it to Strategic Communications Laboratories. That’s what got Cambridge Analytica and Kogan in trouble. (Cambridge Analytica told The Guardian that they do not have possession of the data nor did they use any of this data in the 2016 election. An anonymous source in the Times story disputes this.)","There’s a lot about Cambridge Analytica that doesn’t quite add up. Are they data geniuses who swung the Brexit vote and got Trump elected, or pretenders bluffing their way to fat marketing contracts? Right after the election, several stories pointed to their psychological profiles of voters as a crucial piece of the Trump digital machine. As time has gone on, their role has come to be seen as less important, more in line with the tiny slice of the Trump campaign treasury that they got, roughly $6 million.","While the specifics of this particular violation are important to understand, the story reveals deeper truths about the online world that operates through and within Facebook.","First, some of Facebook’s growth has been driven by apps, which the company found extended the amount of time that people spent on the platform, as retired users of FarmVille could attest. To draw developers, Facebook had quite lax (or, as one might say, “developer-friendly”) data policies for years.","Academic researchers began publishing warnings that third-party Facebook apps represented a major possible source of privacy leakage in the early 2010s. Some noted that the privacy risks inherent in sharing data with apps were not at all clear to users. One group termed our new reality “interdependent privacy,” because your Facebook friends, in part, determine your own level of privacy.","For as long as apps have existed, they have asked for a lot of data and people have been prone to give it to them. Back in 2010, Penn State researchers systematically recorded what data the top 1,800 apps on Facebook were asking for. They presented their results in 2011 with the paper “Third-Party Apps on Facebook: Privacy and the Illusion of Control.” The table below shows that 148 apps were asking for permission to access friends’ information.","Pennsylvania State University","But that’s not the only way that friends leak their friends’ data. Take the example of letting an app see your photos. As the Penn State researchers show, all kinds of data can be harvested: who’s tagged in photos, who liked any of the pictures, who commented on them, and what they said.","If one were to systematically crawl through all the data that could be gleaned from just a user’s basic information, one could build a decent picture of that person’s social world, including a substantial amount of information about their friends.","Facebook has tightened up some of its policies in recent years, especially around apps accessing friends’ data. But TheGuardian’s reporting suggests that the company’s efforts to restuff Pandora’s box have been lax. Wylie, the whistleblower, received a letter from Facebook asking him to delete any Facebook data nearly two years after the existence of the data was first reported. “That to me was the most astonishing thing,” Wylie told The Guardian. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”","But even if Facebook were maximally aggressive about policing this kind of situation, what’s done is done. It’s not just that the data escaped, but that Cambridge Analytica almost certainly learned everything they could from it. As stated in The Guardian, the contract between GSR and Strategic Communications Laboratories states, specifically, “The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information.”","It’s important to dwell on this. It’s not that this research was supposed to identify every U.S. voter just from this data, but rather to develop a method for sorting people based on Facebook’s profiles. Wylie believes that the data was crucial in building Cambridge Analytica’s models. It certainly seems possible that once the “training set” had been used to learn how to psychologically profile people, this specific data itself was no longer necessary. But the truth is that no one knows if the Kogan data had much use out in the real world of political campaigning. Psychological profiling sounds nefarious, but the way that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica first attempted to do it may well have proven, as the company maintains, “fruitless.”","So what is to be done? It’s possible that these new stories will cause Facebook to restrict the use of its data by people outside the company, including legitimate researchers. But that kind of self-imposed or external regulation would not strike at what’s actually scary about these efforts.","If Cambridge Analytica’s targeted advertising works, people worry they could be manipulated with information—or even thoughts—that they did not consent to giving anyone. And societally, a democracy running on micro-targeted political advertisements tuned specifically for ever tinier slices of the population is in trouble, as scholars like Zeynep Tufekci warned in 2012 (and in 2014).","Those two concerns extend far beyond Cambridge Analytica. In fact, the best system for micro-targeting ads, political or otherwise, to particularly persuadable segments of the population is Facebook itself. This is why Facebook’s market value is half a trillion dollars.","In Facebook’s ad system, there are no restrictions on sending ads to people based on any “targetable” attribute, like older men who are interested in the “Confederate States of America” and the National Rifle Association and who are “likely to engage with political content (conservative).”","A screenshot from Facebook’s ad-purchasing platform (Alexis Madrigal)","That’s to say nothing of the ability to create databases of people from other sources—electoral rolls, data on purchasing habits or group affiliations, or anything gleaned by the hundreds of online data companies—then letting Facebook itself match those people up to their Facebook accounts. Facebook might never reveal the names in an audience to advertisers or political campaigns, but the effects are the same.","Facebook’s laxity and the researcher’s malfeasance are newsworthy. But is the problem with privacy-obviating social networks, psychological profiling, and political micro-targeting that some researcher violated Facebook’s terms of service? Or is it that this controversy estranges the whole enterprise, providing a route to approach the almost unthinkable changes that have come to democratic processes in the Facebook era?","We want to hear what you think about this article.

The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.","Related Coverage","The recovery in Facebook’s stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company’s relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.","The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.","If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.","ALL APOLOGIES","Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company’s privacy practices.","The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.","The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.","“Facebook’s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,” said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.","Slideshow (3 Images)","In Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is “absolutely certain” that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.","Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers’ access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.","“The was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time,” Zuckerberg said in the ads. “We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”","‘FUTURE REGULATION’","His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany’s justice minister said Facebook’s promises were not enough.","“In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,” Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.","Advertisers and users are also unhappy.","U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet’s YouTube for one week.","Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.","Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.","Reporting by David Shepardson; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Susan Thomas"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-27"}

The markets are completely split on whether the Fed will project three rate hikes this year or four,” said Hiroaki Mino, senior strategist at Mizuho Securities.","Facebook (FB.O) led the losses, tumbling 6.8 percent as the social media colossus faced demands from U.S. and European lawmakers to explain how a consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump’s election campaign gained improper access to data on 50 million Facebook users.","In addition, worries about the potential for a U.S.-China trade war cast a shadow after U.S. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and suggested punitive tariffs on some $60 billion worth of Chinese information technology, telecoms and consumer products annually.","The sharp fall in share prices put a lid on long-term U.S. bond yields while short-dated yields rose ahead of an expected rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve after its two-day policy meeting starting on Tuesday.","The yield on 10-year Treasuries was 2.845 percent US10YT=RR, little changed on the week and about 10 basis points below the four-year high of 2.957 percent touched a month ago.","But the yield on two-year notes US2YT=RR hit a 9 1/2-year high of 2.32 percent as the Fed appears set to bump up its policy interest rates USFFTARGET= to 1.50-1.75 percent from the current 1.25-1.50 percent.","But with a Fed rate rise already fully priced in, the dollar barely gained from the prospect of a rate hike.

It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees.","A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez.","Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.”","He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.”","On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users — and whether it had been taken without consent.","Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks.","“The Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,” the panel said.","In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear.","Spokespeople for two of the committees — the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee — did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday.","Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify.","Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebook’s own platforms; he hasn’t used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed.","Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Apple’s tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Google’s then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his company’s size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals.","Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senate’s top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take “formal” action — a subtle threat of a subpoena — that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway.","In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation.","In the U.S., Facebook’s use of people’s data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumers’ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.","We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.","Elizabeth DwoskinElizabeth Dwoskin joined The Washington Post as Silicon Valley correspondent in 2016, becoming the paper's eyes and ears in the region and in the wider world of tech.

In short, what was Mark Zuckerberg thinking?","What makes recent disclosures about illicit uses of Facebook data so exasperating to opinion leaders and millions of everyday users is the delayed, disingenuous and tone-deaf responses from corporate management. It took five days from the publication of bombshell exposés in the New York Times and Observer, during which Facebook shed nearly $50 billion in market value, before the company’s two top executives finally issued what was widely considered to be an inadequate response.","During the protracted silence from Facebook’s CEO and COO, other senior company executives took to Twitter and Facebook to deny corporate culpability. One post vigorously disputed that Facebook’s systems had been breached, insisting on a technically correct, but blame-shifting explanation: “This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”","This semantics lesson on the meaning of “breach” provided little comfort to users, who rarely parse the fine print in Facebook’s terms of service, and in any event expect Facebook to protect their private data from harmful and unauthorized use. As Mark Zuckerberg finally acknowledged in his long-awaited response (on Facebook of course), “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. “","In another instance of Facebook’s inadequate initial response, a Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast, “The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”","But Facebook’s outrage was too little, too late, as the cause of the company’s breach of trust should have been recognized and forcefully addressed over three years earlier. In 2014, a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan gave a publicized speech in Singapore, describing how he was able to analyze a sample of over 50 million Facebook users for whom he developed “the ability to predict virtually any trait.” Kogan also boasted of having built a database of every friendship made in the world on Facebook from 2006-2012.","One year later, The Guardian published a detailed account of how campaign consultancy Cambridge Analytica − who had paid to gain access to Kogan’s massive database on unwitting US Facebook users − was using detailed psychological profiles on the US electorate for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. In response, Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to certify (as in “check the box on this form”) that they had destroyed the ill-gotten user data. But Facebook failed to pursue any forensic follow up to ensure that this dangerously potent asset had in fact been wiped clean.","In early 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, and paid the firm over $6 million with the remit to provide a wide range of services including data analytics, voter profiling, micro-targeting, social media message development, digital marketing and campaign planning. Did Cambridge Analytica continue to use its ill-gotten massive Facebook database on behalf of the Trump campaign? Circumstantial evidence certainly points in that direction. Whistleblower Chris Wylie has recounted that Cambridge Analytica board member Steve Bannon had exhorted employees to weaponize psychological profiling in a self-proclaimed “win-at-any-cost” culture war being fought on the 2016 election battlefield. The Financial Times reported that Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, boasted of using “a massive database of [nearly] 5,000 data points on every adult in America” to support the successful Trump campaign. And immediately after the election, Cambridge Analytica took credit for the win, claiming that its data helped to place targeted online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times.","In his belated mea culpa, Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook “made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.” But the company’s track record of systemic failures to protect user privacy or to prevent malevolent uses of its proprietary database suggests that were it not for investigative reporting by the New York Times, Observer and undercover reporting by Channel 4 News in London, we probably would not be having an urgent public discourse on Facebook’s management shortcomings today.","Why has Facebook consistently struggled to protect its users’ personal information and to prevent malicious exploitation of its platform?","Going forward, can we trust Facebook to “take whatever steps are required” to address serious concerns with their business practices?","The most common answer to the first question is that Facebook’s business model inexorably drives their observed behavior. After all, Facebook’s success is built on amassing (or less charitably, surveilling) information on consumer behavior, enabling it to sell targeted advertising that delivers superior marketing ROI. This devilishly effective business model has enabled Facebook to create an extraordinarily profitable enterprise – in round numbers, a $50 billion revenue run rate, growing at 50% per year with 50% operating margins. It is thus not surprising that the company would be reluctant to tinker with such successful business practices.","The Perfect Storm Behind Mark Zuckerberg’s Corporate Myopia","But there is deeper dynamic at play that explains Facebook’s chronic inability to recognize the potential societal harm and reputational risk that its platform can and has engendered. Mark Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia results from the perfect storm of three leadership mindsets.","Hubristic vision and soaring ambition to change the world for the better","Overconfidence in the power of technology to solve virtually any problem","A tendency to underestimate “black swan” risks","While these management mindsets are not uncommon in Silicon Valley, when applied in a company of Facebook’s scale, the consequences can be catastrophic.","Mark Zuckerberg passionately believes that the company he founded nearly fifteen years ago has emerged as a uniquely powerful global force for good. He has often proclaimed that the Internet should be considered, like health care and clean water, a basic human right. And within that realm, Zuckerberg regards peer-to-peer communications as a powerful enabler of the company’s mission to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”","Guided by such an altruistic vision, Zuckerberg propelled Facebook’s rapid growth by aggressively pursuing more data, more media, more interactions inside and beyond the platform, more functionality, more user engagement and more global scale and reach. But in retrospect, the company’s fateful error was Zuckerberg’s decision to share user data with outside app developers starting in 2008 (expanded further between 2011 and 2014) in exchange for enhancing Facebook’s functionality and the ability to track its users beyond its platform. By extending Facebook’s surveillance beyond the walled garden of internally generated user data, the company signaled its preference for more data acquisition and portability over safeguarding user privacy.","MAU growthAuthor analysis from company data","Along the way, Facebook certainly was aware of “bad actors” on its platform − the ones that bully users, plant fake news for profit, mindless fun or influence, or who promote fraudulent commerce. But Zuckerberg has consistently exuded confidence that his company’s sophisticated software could detect and prevent malevolent abuses on his platform, despite alarming evidence that Facebook’s bad actor problem has been worsening for years.","There were plenty of reasons for Zuckerberg to overlook danger signs bubbling below the surface of Facebook’s business. By any measure, Facebook had been spectacularly successful in creating a global juggernaut. By the end of 2017, Facebook was serving over 2 billion users and more than 5 million advertisers, rewarding shareholders (including its largest stakeholder, Mark Zuckerberg) with a company valued in excess of one-half trillion dollars.","Such outsized success undoubtedly contributed to Zuckerberg’s corporate myopia in failing to recognize and mitigate the risks of rare, but potentially catastrophic abuses on his platform. Best-selling author and scholar Nassim Taleb has written extensively on the common human tendency to underestimate the likelihood of “black swan” events − defined as situations with low probability but extremely high downside risk. For example, black swan myopia arguably contributed to the lax risk management that led to a number of preventable disasters, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the financial services meltdown of 2008.","In Facebook’s case, black swan myopia led Mark Zuckerberg to largely ignore the reputational risk posed by the malevolent use of Facebook user data before, during and after the 2016 presidential election. Before Cambridge Analytica even began working for the Trump campaign, Facebook failed to verify that the consultancy had actually destroyed its large illicit cache of Facebook user data. During the campaign, Facebook continued to ignore growing reports that the Trump campaign was effectively deploying psychological profiling and micro-targeting techniques, rife with fake news and targeted imagery in pivotal swing states.","And even after President Trump’s gobsmacking victory, Zuckerberg continued to proclaim that the notion that fake news could have influenced the U.S. presidential election was a \"pretty crazy idea,\" going on to dismiss the importance of filter bubbles and claiming that fake news represents a \"very small volume\" of the total content on Facebook’s platform.","Zuckerberg’s stubborn denial of the ability of Cambridge Analytica and other foreign political operatives to exploit Facebook’s data and platform to influence voter behavior is bizarrely hypocritical, since the secret sauce that has always driven Facebook’s profitability is its proven ability to enable advertisers to precisely tailor product messaging to targeted prospective customers.","According to whistleblower Chris Wylie, Steve Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the stated objective of using psychological profiling tools to change voters’ cultural attitudes. In fighting a self-proclaimed culture war, Bannon understood that micro-targeting − akin to smart bombs − could be far more cost effective than carpet bombing political ads on mass media. Cambridge Analytica arguably was in a position to be particularly effective in this regard because they illicitly gained the access to Facebook’s vast user database to build detailed psychological profiling models.","Mark Zuckerberg is not alone in falling prey to the perfect storm of corporate myopia. One could argue that Travis Kalanick at Uber and Elizabeth Holmes at Theranos also had hubristic visions to change the world for the better, coupled with overconfidence in the infallibility of their technology and an inability to recognize black swan risks threatening to damage their company and the world at large. Kalanick was ultimately forced to resign from Uber by his board, and Holmes recently settled a lawsuit with the SEC that forced her to forfeit control of Theranos, now in tatters.","There are of course key differences in Zuckerberg’s case. Unlike the other two executives, Facebook has been spectacularly profitable, and Zuckerberg enjoys bulletproof shareholder control of his company. Under these circumstances, the question is, how will Mark Zuckerberg address the growing challenges threatening Facebook’s future?","Can Zuckerberg Clean Up Facebook’s Mess?","The key to answering this question lies in understanding what problem Mark Zuckerberg will choose to address: quelling the current uproar over the Cambridge Analytica debacle, or addressing broader, longstanding concerns with Facebook’s unprecedented global power to control access to information hiding behind its opaque business practices.","Zuckerberg’s mea culpa media tour starting March 21st clearly signaled his primary interest on the first problem. In his interview with Recode’s Kara Swisher, Zuckerberg opined “the good news is that as of three or four years ago, new apps weren’t able to do what happened here. So this is largely ... this issue is resolved going forward for a while.” As Swisher rightfully observed, Zuckerberg’s comments were predominantly backward-looking, and inadequately recognized the broader challenges that lie ahead.","By focusing Facebook’s attention on tracking down possible terms of service violations by thousands of third party developers many years ago, and promising new controls on developer platform access, Zuckerberg framed Facebook’s problem entirely in terms of external data portability, ignoring the fact that through these interactions, Facebook also amassed and retains extensive data on user behavior for its own commercial purposes.","Worries over just how much user data Facebook routinely collects and how that information is used erupted again this week when press accounts revealed that Facebook has been logging Android users’ telephone calls and SMS messages for years. As with prior concerns expressed over the company’s expansive data capture, Facebook reprised its typical response: “we never sell your data and trust us, having all this information helps us provide a better user experience on our platform.”","But a growing chorus of political leaders no longer trusts Facebook’s blame-shifting apologies and repeated assurances of altruistic intent, and are now calling for the company’s CEO to testify before Congress on a broad range of data privacy concerns. The FTC has also weighed in, opening an investigation to determine whether Facebook’s business practices have been violating a 2011 agreement settling charges over the company’s user privacy policies.","So how can we expect Facebook to respond? Given Mark Zuckerberg’s management mindset, and the company’s track record in dealing with past crises, it would take overwhelming pressure from the government or other key stakeholders for Facebook to move beyond reactive tweaks to its business practices. The harsh reality is, Facebook’s stakeholders are unlikely to mount a serious and sustained challenge to the company’s status quo.","Users","The potential for a user revolt clearly poses the gravest threat to Facebook’s market dominance, which explains why Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have devoted so much of their apology tour last week seeking to restore user trust. Facebook executives are well aware that Uber reportedly lost as much as 15 percentage points of market share in major US metro markets last year after a #deleteuber campaign erupted over the company’s alleged mishandling of its response to protests over President Trump’s Muslim country travel ban. In Uber’s case, consumers had a readily available choice to switch to a competitor (Lyft) offering an essentially comparable service.","Facebook’s situation is considerably different. Despite the genuine outrage expressed over recent damaging revelations, isolated calls to #deletefacebook have failed to gain much traction simply because Facebook is too deeply embedded in the lives of its 2 billion users. Consciously or unwittingly, the vast majority of Facebook users appear to have accepted the Faustian bargain of trading their personal data for free access to Facebook’s valued services. Don’t expect many Facebook or Instagram users to switch to Snapchat any time soon.","Advertisers","As long as users remain engaged on the platform, advertisers will be understandably reluctant to exclude Facebook from their advertising mix. No platform provides nearly as much market reach, targeting effectiveness or useful ROI tracking tools as Facebook. Consequently, why would Facebook’s 5 million advertisers be willing to cede such advantages to competitors? While a few companies have in fact announced a temporary suspension of Facebook advertising (e.g., Pep Boys, Sonos, Commerzbank), Facebook is likely to remain a dominant a channel for most advertisers in the months ahead.","Investors/Government","As long as users and advertisers stay on board, many investors are likely to follow suit. Facebook’s recent loss of market value largely reflects current investor nervousness over the prospect for restrictive government regulation. Mark Zuckerberg surprisingly fanned the flames of investor concern by signaling his support for appropriate regulatory controls.","But there are reasons to doubt that government action will be swift, comprehensive or overly damaging to Facebook’s business model. For starters, President Trump will obviously seek to discourage debate on an issue that relitigates the legitimacy of his 2016 election. On Capitol Hill, Congress already has a full agenda of more pressing political issues to deal with, going into the 2018 midterm elections. As such, today’s announcement that the FTC is launching an investigation of Facebook may give Congress cover to pass the baton in dealing with this gnarly issue.","It would not be surprising to see Facebook voluntarily announcing a few enhancements to its data privacy policies in the coming months to diminish the perceived urgency for comprehensive government regulation. These dynamics suggest that government action is likely to be slow and measured at best, giving investors time to monitor and react to Facebook’s actual financial performance in the months ahead, which promises to remain strong.","Board of directors","Facebook has a distinguished board that in normal circumstances could be counted on to exert strong oversight over the company's operational and reputational risk management. But a board can go only so far in reining in a CEO who controls 60% of the voting shares of the fifth largest publicly traded company in the world. Mark Zuckerberg will continue to be the loudest voice in the room in guiding Facebook’s strategic direction.","Competitors","What competitors? Facebook has exploited strong network economies of scale and a relentless appetite to acquire or replicate the services of upstart competitors. While it is true that Facebook will likely be barred from additional major acquisitions, the company has already built a seemingly unassailable lead over competitors in the advertising-supported social media space. Even if Congress does act to impose limits on future user data sourcing and portability, it may actually strengthen Facebook’s current competitive advantage given that it already has by far the biggest user database in the industry.","So where does that leave us? In the months ahead, we’re likely to see a number of incremental improvements in Facebook’s business practices through a combination of voluntary company policy changes and possible regulatory reforms governing the allowable sourcing and use of personal data.","Greater transparency in identifying the sponsors and content of targeted ads on Facebook’s platform (particularly those involving political content)","Tighter controls over user data portability across the Internet","More stringent requirements for users to be asked for opt-in permission (in clear language) before Facebook can collect and store user data.","These welcome changes will not unduly crimp Facebook’s extraordinarily successful business model, and may even help Mark Zuckerberg overcome his corporate myopia that has exposed the company to preventable reputational risk in the past. Whether we “Like” it or not, we’re destined to live in the social media world we collectively helped Facebook build for many more years to come.","I am an Executive in Residence and Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, teaching courses in business strategy and corporate entrepreneurship.

And the public content you see more will be held to the same standard—it should encourage meaningful interactions between people.”","Zuckerberg cited “a responsibility to make sure our services aren’t just fun to use, but also good for people’s well-being” as justification for the change, admitting that businesses will have to work harder than ever to gain their customers’ attention on the platform.","Many brands and publishers understandably reacted to the announcement with worry and apprehension. After all, Facebook is the largest social media platform in the world. And though organic reach has been declining for a while, the platform has never publicly admitted it until now.","Luckily, Facebook offered several clues in their announcement and official press release about what brands can do to continue reaching customers on the platform. They also ran a News Feed webinar for publishers, which Matt Navaro generously shared on Twitter.","What are “Meaningful Interactions”?","First things first. Facebook no longer cares how much time users spend on its platform, as long as that time is “quality” time.","This is a big deal as most social networks, including Facebook, have traditionally competed for increasing lengths of “time spent.” The longer users spent on a network, the better. It was a signal of the network-in-question’s popularity.","But no longer. One of the ways Facebook is measuring quality is by defining certain actions as more “meaningful” than others.","The new algorithm prioritizes active interactions like commenting and sharing over likes and click-throughs (passive interactions)—the idea being that actions requiring more effort on the part of the user are of higher quality and thus more meaningful. Rather than passively scrolling through the News Feed and occasionally pausing to “like” a photo or an article, Facebook wants users to be inspired to engage in conversations with each other.","It is these kinds of “meaningful” interactions—the ones that take more effort—that contribute to “quality” time on the platform and (arguably) help Facebook get back to its roots as a network primarily used by friends and family to keep in touch with each other.","Here’s a breakdown of the interactions Facebook says qualify as “meaningful.”","Top ranking factors for the Facebook algorithm","1. Comments","In his announcement, Zuckerberg wrote, “Pages making posts that people generally don’t react to or comment on could see the biggest decreases in distribution. Pages whose posts prompt conversations between friends will see less of an effect.”","This means brands should create quality content focused on sparking conversations between users. Try including questions in your posts, or writing about timely, relevant topics that users are sure to have an opinion on.","The point is, users will be more likely to see your Facebook posts if their friends and family are commenting on it.","2. Reactions","If a user takes the time to hit the “love” icon vs. the “like” icon, your content will receive a minor boost in the News Feed. Just as in life, “loving” is a more valued emotional signal than “liking.”","The same goes for all Facebook’s reactions: Haha, Wow, Sad, and Angry. Facebook wants to see those “active” emotions.","3. Comment replies","The algorithm not only favors comments, but also replies to comments. These signal that a piece of content is inspiring conversation between users. (Remember, Zuckerberg deems “conversation” the most important outcome of this algorithm update). That means you want to be publishing content that inspires users to tag their friends in comments and start a conversation.","4. Sharing links over Messenger to a group of friends","If a user shares a piece of content to their wall, that’s great. But what’s even better is if they take the time to send it to a friend (or a group of friends) over Facebook messenger.","Of all the “meaningful interactions” listed here, this is the one that makes the most sense to me because—think about it—what’s more meaningful? A friend posting an article to their wall? Or a friend sending an article to you with a note that says, “Hey, just read this and I think you would really enjoy it too”? Yeah. That’s what I thought.","5. Engagement on shares","While sharing a post is a pretty “active” interaction compared to most, Facebook is going one step further. Simply getting shares is not enough. Your post must be shared and get engagement on that share to be prioritized in the algorithm.","Other Facebook News Feed ranking signals","According to Facebook’s News Feed webinar, the five “meaningful interactions” listed above are priority signals. But that doesn’t mean they’re the only actions the algorithm cares about. The following ranking signals are less important, but still worth noting:","Average time spent on content. This is just what it sounds like—the average amount of time a user spends engaging with or viewing a post. Presumably longer is better, but Facebook hasn’t released any clear info on that since the update.","When it’s posted. This is an indirect signal because it means that your post is more likely to get engagement if you post it at a time that users are likely to be online.","Story type. Is your post a status update, photo, link, video, or live video? (Facebook’s press release specifically mentioned live video as often “leading to discussion among viewers.” But that is the only clue about what story types the algorithm might prioritize.)","Completeness of page profile. The more fields you fill out on your Facebook business page, the better. This is so that Facebook and potential followers can get a clear idea of who you are and the legitimacy of your business.","How informative the post is. Facebook tweaked its algorithm to highlight “informative posts” back in 2016. But, the term “informative” was based on a survey of users’ personal interpretation. For some users “informative” could mean “news”, while for others it could mean recipes or celebrity gossip. It’s not clear whether that definition has changed since the 2018 update.","There are likely many more signals that contribute to a post’s News Feed ranking, but these are the only ones we have information on at the time of writing.","8 tips to increase organic reach on Facebook","1. Focus on video—but especially live video","As far as we can tell, videos are still favored under the new algorithm, but live videos will be even more important. In his announcement, Zuckerberg wrote that “live videos often lead to discussion among viewers on Facebook—in fact, live videos on average get six times as many interactions as regular videos.”","This means if you haven’t already invested time and energy into posting live videos on Facebook, you 100 percent should do so now. This is one of Facebook’s few concrete examples of content that will perform well under the new algorithm, so we would all do well to pay attention to it.","National Geographic has been doing a great job of incorporating live video into their strategy. They post 70 live stories a month reaching over one million viewers, often bringing followers on “live safaris” in the jungle.","Watch a leopard on foot LIVE from the Sabi Sand, Greater Kruger National Park, South Africa!","2. Avoid engagement bait","It might be tempting to try and hack the new algorithm by asking your audience to “COMMENT on this post if you like ice cream!!” or something similar. But don’t be that brand. It’s spammy and users don’t like it.","Plus, Facebook says, “Using ‘engagement-bait’ to goad people into commenting on posts is not a meaningful interaction, and we will continue to demote these posts in News Feed.”","See below for some even more specific examples of engagement bait. Facebook promised these types of posts would be “down-ranked” in its News Feed webinar.","3. Focus on community building through Facebook groups","Because Facebook Groups already operate on the basis of audience engagement, this marketing tactic will likely serve you well under the new algorithm. Under “What type of Page posts create meaningful interactions?” in Facebook’s official press release, Adam Mosseri specifically mentioned Facebook Groups. “In Groups, people often interact around public content. Local businesses connect with their communities by posting relevant updates and creating events.”","Bonus:Download a free guide that teaches you how to turn Facebook traffic into sales in four simple steps using Hootsuite.","The popular Canadian skincare company Deciem is a great example of a brand who is benefiting from Facebook Groups. In the group “DECIEM ENTHUSIASTS,” customers share product reviews, skincare regimens (which always involve Deciem products), advice, and company news (such as the much-talked-about firing of a Co-CEO).","4. Keep creating quality content that resonates with your audience","This is the single most important piece of advice in this list. Everything about “meaningful interactions” boils down to creating quality content that people actually want to see. And how do you know what people want to see? By researching your audience, running tests, and regularly checking your analytics.","Quality content should already spark emotion in your followers. But, imagery and captions are important factors in engagement as well. Check out this post that Hootsuite shared to their Facebook page:","This post did well on Facebook because:","We knew the topic would be valuable to our audience of social media professionals.","The caption accompanying the content provokes some emotions (relief, and inspiration to be great at your job).","It comes across as trustworthy rather than sales-focused (We’re not asking you to sign up for Hootsuite. We’re providing value whether you use Hootsuite or not.).","Another way to prompt engagement and comments from followers is to ask questions. In the post below, we asked readers what books they would recommend.","Whatever your company size, publishing quality, research-backed content should be the backbone of your Facebook marketing strategy. After that, the rest will fall into place.","5. Invest in your ads budget","But now that Facebook is deprioritizing content from brands and publishers, these skills will be more important than ever. Businesses must know how to target the right audiences to ensure their advertising dollars go further.","6. Connect with Facebook influencers","In the official press release, Adam Mosseri wrote, “Many creators who post videos on Facebook prompt discussion among their followers, as do posts from celebrities.” You could interpret this literally, but I’m willing to guess that the majority of brands on Facebook don’t have access to celeb product promos.","Enter the influencer—“regular” people like you and me who happen to have large followings on social media and who have worked hard to gain the trust of their followers. Getting an influencer to post to their page on your brand’s behalf could very well lead to increased engagement and followers for you because, if the content is coming from someone people trust, it appears more authentic. Facebook has noted that it will show more posts from “publishers the community finds trustworthy.”","But make sure the content still follows all the guidelines in this list. Just because an influencer is posting it doesn’t mean it doesn’t have to be well-researched, valuable, or “meaningful.” It still has to spark conversation.","Plus, influencer marketing is a whole other ballgame. Make sure you’re prepared with a strategy before diving in.","7. Localize (shift priority to local news)","In the “Priorities for News in 2018” section of its News Feed webinar, Facebook noted that local news would be prioritized. This is great for publishers and businesses that already work the local angle. But, it’s harder for larger, global brands. Try changing things up by narrowing in on different geographical areas every so often. Promote an event in a specific city, or publish stories that affect a specific region. There are many ways to interpret and get creative with this ranking signal.","8. Encourage customers to follow your Page","One thing that’s not changing about the Facebook news feed is the ability for users to make sure they always see posts from their favorite Pages by choosing “See First” in their news feed preferences.","This means businesses shouldn’t be shy about asking customers to follow their page on Facebook. They could even remind loyal followers about the “See First” option.","These tips are useful for publishing content on all social media platforms—not just Facebook. As always, there’s no reason to fear algorithm changes if you are already dedicated to providing your customers with valuable, quality content. Facebook is working hard to make sure it is showing users content that they care about and that’s from trustworthy sources—so make sure you’re one of them.","Manage your Facebook presence alongside your other social media channels using Hootsuite.

Through public records requests, the ACLU learned that Geofeedia had been providing law enforcement with information gathered from social media, including people's location data. Geofeedia, which works with hundreds of local police departments, also specifically targeted people on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter who had participated in demonstrations against police violence and abuse, the ACLU found.","The investigation raised serious concerns about Twitter and Facebook's role in aiding government surveillance, and it undercut the companies' public commitments to supporting activism and free speech. Since the results of the ACLU's investigation went public, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have cut off Geofeedia's access to their users' data.","The ACLU praised Facebook's updated developer policy as a positive change. “Now more than ever, we expect companies to slam shut any surveillance side doors and make sure nobody can use their platforms to target people of color and activists,” said Nicole Ozer, the director of technology and civil liberties at the ACLU of California, in a statement.","Still, the ACLU, the Center for Media Justice, and Color of Change have urged Facebook to do more to enforce its prohibition on surveillance. In a statement Monday, the advocacy groups described the updated policy as a \"first step.\"","Facebook enforces its developer rules through both automated and human audits. The company told BuzzFeed News that developers must disclose what they are using Facebook data for, and that Facebook can conduct broader audits after they receive a complaint of potential violations. But the advocacy groups emphasized the need for strict enforcement of Facebook's policies to suss out developers who break surveillance rules, and \"swift action for violations.\"","Hamza Shaban is a technology policy reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, DC."],"isopubdate":""}

This comes in response to the recent changes made by Facebook to their privacy settings, especially to the one leaving the default \"on\" instead of \"off.\" Basically it became quite apparent that Facebook is in fact, a business, and that your so-called \"personal\" data was for sale. To economists and investors, this was no surprise at all. They all expected Facebook to make a genuine attempt to make money at some point, and what better way than demographic targeted advertising?","When it came to the users though, the backlash to the recent changes and integration of Facebook across multiple sharing networks has been less than mixed. It's been negative. There have been constant tweets and articles written about Facebook's complete disregard for our \"personal\" data.","The claims are valid. Suddenly, it's not just your friends that are viewing your updates and profile, it's their friends, strangers and marketers - unless you change your settings. The setting changes aren't complex, they are quite simple in fact - but the sudden notification by Facebook is what irked a lot of people. They started to worry about their \"personal\" data. All along though, within all the complaints and stress about \"personal\" data, people lost sight of a couple of realities.","First off - what is data? For the answer to that question, I turn to Loren Feldman of 1938 Media. In this video, he explains exactly what \"data\" is.","To sum up, data is what you put in the computer, that goes to the internet and either gets lost or sold. That is what data is. It's inevitable and a side effect of doing business on the internet. It's also a side effect of doing pleasure on the internet, and that is where the adjective \"personal\" comes in. So what exactly is \"personal\" on the internet? Well, that's easy. Nothing. Not a damn thing. You may think it is, but it isn't. That's not just paranoia talking - someone, somewhere has access to your personal data. From the I.T. guys running the bank servers, to the advertisers buying it from your email client, to Facebook opening it up for the world to see.","Don't even get me started on privacy. It's the internet. Not a shrinks office. Though that's debatable sometimes.","The inherent problem then is expectations. People expect their \"personal\" data to remain personal and private. This expectation is set at some point by the site they are entering their personal data into. Or, it's a site like Linkedin, where the expectation of complete transparency is set. The thing is, as Loren mentioned in the video, no one reads the terms of service contracts. When you click the little check box and hit continue, you are agreeing to pages and pages of legalese that pretty much state you don't have any personal data and you have absolutely no privacy on that site. They own it all. This isn't true for every site of course, but a good majority of them.","The lesson here is that you should only put data on the internet that you are comfortable with being shared, viewed or sold by people that are not you. In this era of social media and sharing, there have been so many cases of just blatant ignorance. What do you think will happen if you put inappropriate pictures on Facebook when your boss is on your friend list? Nothing? This isn't the era of anonymous postings in forums and BBS chat rooms anymore. We remember that, but do our kids?","In order for them to understand what privacy and personal data is when it comes to the internet, we need to understand what it is. We need to educate ourselves by reading those terms of service contracts, noting which sites are sharing and which ones aren't as well as being vigilant as to what kind of personal data we're so eagerly sharing with the world. We need to realize that what we think is personal or private is nothing of the sort.","Once we have that through our heads, then we won't be pitching a fit when a social networking site changes their privacy settings to allow us more sharing options. What are your expectations about personal data and privacy on the internet? Let us know in the comments!"],"isopubdate":"2010-05-07"}

It then reportedly tapped the information to build psychographic profiles of users and their friends, which were used for targeted political ads in the UK's Brexit referendum campaign, as well as by Trump's team during the 2016 US election.","Facebook says it told Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, but reports suggest the info wasn't destroyed. Cambridge Analytica says it complies with the social network's rules, only receives data \"obtained legally and fairly,\" and did wipe out the data Facebook is worried about.","Here's what you need to know.","Now playing:Watch this:\nDid Facebook lose control of your information?","3:28","What is Cambridge Analytica?","Cambridge Analytica is a UK-based data analytics firm, whose parent company is Strategic Communication Laboratories. Cambridge Analytica helps political campaigns reach potential voters online. The firm combines data from multiple sources, including online information and polling, to build \"profiles\" of voters. It then uses computer programs to predict voter behavior, which could be influenced through specialized advertisements aimed at the voters.","\"We have lots of history of things,\" Nix said in the videos, \"I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done.\"","Nix has since been suspended from his job as CEO. His comments \"do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,\" the company said in a statement.","What did Cambridge Analytica do?","Facebook said in a statement on March 16 that Cambridge Analytica received user data from Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge. Kogan reportedly created an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" that ostensibly offered personality predictions to users while calling itself a research tool for psychologists.","The app asked users to log in using their Facebook accounts. As part of the login process, it asked for access to users' Facebook profiles, locations, what they liked on the service, and importantly, their friends' data as well.","Facebook's data appears to have been improperly used for political purposes during the UK's Brexit vote and the 2016 US presidential election.","Getty Images","The problem, Facebook says, is that Kogan then sent this user data to Cambridge Analytica without user permission, something that's against the social network's rules.","\"Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement.","Kogan didn't respond to requests for comment. The New York Times said he cited nondisclosure agreements and declined to provide details about what happened, saying his personality prediction program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\"","Cambridge Analytica also worked with other 2016 presidential election campaigns, according to its website and various media reports. Those included the campaigns of Sen. Ted Cruz and candidate Ben Carson, who went on to join Trump's cabinet as secretary of housing and urban development.","Why did Facebook ban Cambridge Analytica from its service?","Facebook said Cambridge Analytica \"certified\" three years ago it had deleted the information, as did Kogan. But since then, Facebook said, it's received reports that not all the user data was deleted. The New York Times reported at the outset of this controversy that at least some of it remains.","Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that it deleted all the data and is in contact with Facebook about the issue.","\"I'm actually really confused by Facebook,\" Wylie said. \"They make me out to be this suspect or some kind of nefarious person.\"","Was Facebook hacked?","The New York Times characterized the original problem as a data \"breach\" and said it's \"one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history.\" That's in part because the roughly 270,000 users who gave Kogan access to their information allowed him to collect data on their friends as well. In total, more than 87 million Facebook users are said to have been affected.","Facebook, however, says that while Kogan mishandled its data, all the information Kogan got was accessed legally and within its rules. The problem is that Kogan was supposed to hold on to the information himself, not hand it over to Cambridge Analytica or anyone else. Because the information was accessed through normal means, Facebook disputes the characterization of the incident as a breach.","\"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" the company said.","Wait, so Facebook allows apps to access my data?","When you log in to an app using your Facebook account, the developer typically asks for access to information the social network has. Sometimes it's just your name and email address. Other times, it's your location and your friends' data too.","All this is pretty much what any app developer that works with Facebook was allowed to do until 2015, when Facebook prevented app developers from accessing friends' data. Everything else, though, is still fair game.","Facebook says its rules specify that developers can't share the information they receive with other firms. That's where the problem with Kogan and Cambridge Analytica comes up.","The company has an app review process it puts developers through. Once they're cleared, things are A-OK.","Facebook, by the way, is hoping to stop the next Cambridge Analytica. It's offered a bounty to anyone who finds apps that misuse Facebook data. The company has also revamped its tools to help you identify which apps have access to your data, as well as those to strengthen security of your profile. Facebook also made it easier to download data it has on you.","Could this lead to more regulation?","Zuckerberg himself said it might.","\"I'm actually not sure we shouldn't be regulated,\" he said in an interview with CNN on March 21. \"The question is, what is the right regulation?\"","He answered that question on April 6, saying he supports the Honest Ads Act, a proposed law that would require tech companies to disclose how political ads are targeted and how much they cost.","Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are looking for answers from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.","James Martin/CNET","Regardless of whether that bill becomes a law, there's one thing we know for sure: The honeymoon between the tech industry and government is over. After decades of (mostly) treating tech companies as favored children, legislators and government regulators are increasingly taking a tougher stance against them.","\"This latest fiasco could reignite the debate within the Beltway and EU around a tighter regulatory environment Facebook and its social platform brethren could face going forward,\" Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights, wrote in a note to investors right after the controversy erupted. \"This represents another critical period for Facebook to hand hold and assure its users and regulators around tighter content standards and platform security in light of this latest PR nightmare.\"","\"Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook,\" the agency said in a statement on March 26. \"Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.\"","The consent decree required that Facebook must get users to agree to and must notify them about the social network sharing their data. Facebook earlier told The Washington Post it rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\"","In Europe, where regulators have traditionally taken a tough stance on social media and privacy, the president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, tweeted that EU lawmakers \"will investigate fully, calling digital platforms to account.\" In the UK, Damian Collins, the chair of Parliament's committee overseeing digital matters, said Zuckerberg needs to stand up and answer questions directly.","What happened in Zuckerberg's appearance before Congress?","A little over three weeks after the Cambridge Analytica news broke, Zuckerberg went to Washington, where over two days he endured 10 hours of questioning by congressional committees. Echoing earlier statements, he apologized to lawmakers for Facebook's recent missteps and voiced support for some regulation of the tech industry.","In his first day of testimony, he did score some points. Zuckerberg addressed a room full of Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committee members who struggled to understand what Facebook does, how the social platform works, and how to regulate it. He escaped largely unscathed, having settled into his role as both an explainer of technology and a receiver of the occasional finger-wag.","But on day two, things got a little rougher. His appearance before the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee was defined by pointed questions from lawmakers who appeared to have done their homework.","Some, like New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, hammered Zuckerberg on default privacy settings. California Rep. Anna Eshoo asked Zuckerberg if his own data was swept up in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (He said that it was.) And Florida Rep. Kathy Castor and New Mexico Rep. Ben Lujan raised concerns about how much Facebook follows people as they browse the web -- and whether people without accounts on the social media network still get tracked via \"shadow profiles.\" Zuckerberg said that he wasn't familiar with that term and that Facebook collects data on nonusers for security purposes.","\"Your business is built on trust, and you're losing trust,\" Lujan said.","But apparently Facebook hasn't lost Wall Street's confidence. The company's shares rose approximately 5 percent over the two days of testimony.","Was this similar to what the Obama campaign did on Facebook?","Sort of. The Obama campaign did collect a similar level of data from its app, which includes both your information and your friend's information.","But as Politifact notes, users were willingly giving up that information and knew it was going to a political campaign. The Obama campaign used your friend's data to figure out who may or may not be willing to vote for him, and sent messages to users to persuade their friends.","That's different from the Cambridge Analytica situation, since most users taking the digital life quiz had no idea that the data would be used for political purposes.","What's Facebook doing about this?","After five long days, Zuckerberg broke his silence on March 21 with a nearly 1,000-word post on his Facebook page. (C'mon, did you really expect it to show up on Twitter?) The post was his first since since March 2, when he shared a photo of his family celebrating the Jewish holiday of Purim.","Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes with users' information. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data,\" he wrote. \"And if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.\"","He's since sat down for several media interviews, and on April 4, held an hour-long conference call with journalists. \"Life is learning from mistakes,\" Zuckerberg said. \"At the end of the day, this is my responsibility. I started this place, I run it, I'm responsible.\"","The company, he said, is now facing two central questions: \"Can we get our systems under control and second, can we make sure that our systems aren't used to undermine democracy,\" Zuckerberg said.","\"It's not enough to give people a voice, we have to make sure that people are not using that voice to spread disinformation,\" he added.","We have a responsibility to protect your data. And if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg","He's promised to investigate apps that had access to \"large amounts of information\" before the company made changes to how much information third-party apps could access in 2018. Facebook will conduct a full audit of apps that exhibit suspicious behavior and bar developers who don't agree to audits.","Facebook's public missteps have brought up other concerns about Facebook too. One example is a memo leaked to BuzzFeed penned by Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth, a top Facebook executive. The 2016 memo advocates growth above everything else, regardless of whether people use Facebook to bully and harass one another.","\"The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good,\" he wrote at the time. He's since said he was trying to stir debate, and didn't agree with what he'd written.","The company is also planning to further restrict political advertising, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's COO, said in an interview with Bloomberg. \"If you were using hate-based language in ads for elections, we're drawing those lines much tighter and applying them uniformly,\" she said.","Last, Facebook will begin displaying a gauge at the top of your News Feed that lets you know which apps you've used and let you revoke their permissions.","We're also starting to see some action that could hit Facebook in the wallet. Within days of the scandal erupting, Firefox maker Mozilla said it would no longer advertise on Facebook because of data privacy concerns, and it launched a petition to ask the social network to improve its privacy settings. Meanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has taken a different kind of stand. Prompted by an inquiry from a Twitter user, he quickly deleted both companies' Facebook pages. So did Playboy, for what it's worth.","Ultimately, reform is what's needed, said former Cambridge Analytica executive Brittany Kaiser. \"For many years, I never questioned it,\" Kaiser said. \"That's the way that the political system works. That's the way that advertising works. That's the way that every single industry that exists in the entire basis of digital communications works. I do really understand the industry, and I have the ability to be a voice for change.\"","What can I do?","There isn't much. You may've been swept up in this without even knowing it. You don't have to have downloaded Kogan's app to have had your information accessed, since the statements and articles say the app slurped up information about users' friends.","Cambridge Analytica also doesn't appear to offer a way for you to request your information be removed from its systems. The company didn't respond to a request for comment.","As for Facebook, you can always try to lodge a complaint with Zuckerberg."],"isopubdate":"2018-04-18"}

They would then use that data to do things like append their email lists.","“They came to office in the days following election recruiting & were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side,” Davidsen tweeted.","Douglas Graham /CQ Roll Call/Getty","She added that she believes Facebook also recruits people “on the other side” too:","I am also 100% positive that Facebook activity recruits and staffs people that are on the other side.","Davidsen began the tweet thread with a link to a Time article outlining the Obama campaign's Facebook targeting campaign, which she said was codenamed “Project Taargus”:","That’s because the more than 1 million Obama backers who signed up for the [Facebook-based app] gave the campaign permission to look at their Facebook friend lists. In an instant, the campaign had a way to see the hidden young voters. Roughly 85% of those without a listed phone number could be found in the uploaded friend lists. What’s more, Facebook offered an ideal way to reach them. “People don’t trust campaigns. They don’t even trust media organizations,” says Goff. “Who do they trust? Their friends.”","The campaign called this effort targeted sharing. And in those final weeks of the campaign, the team blitzed the supporters who had signed up for the app with requests to share specific online content with specific friends simply by clicking a button. More than 600,000 supporters followed through with more than 5 million contacts, asking their friends to register to vote, give money, vote or look at a video designed to change their mind. A geek squad in Chicago created models from vast data sets to find the best approaches for each potential voter. “We are not just sending you a banner ad,” explains Dan Wagner, the Obama campaign’s 29-year-old head of analytics, who helped oversee the project. “We are giving you relevant information from your friends.”","Facebook did not immediately respond to IJR's request for comment.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night.","Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill.","“I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,” Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday.","Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming.","“I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,” Collins said in his statement. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”","Věra Jourová, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as “horrifying, if confirmed,” in a tweet. Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek “further clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.”","Facebook declined to comment on the calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica.","“We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement.","Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform — especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race — has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch.","And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter.","“Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps they’re above the rules that apply to everybody else,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of a Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”","It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users — including the names of users, their “likes,” friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests.","Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data.","“We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday.","Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way.","Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a “breach” of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially.","In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook “friend” data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the company’s systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so.","But the idea of a “breach” seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a “major breach.”","Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines.","In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, “We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.”","Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling.","“The recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. “Facebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.”","U.S. lawmakers last fall questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spread disinformation during the 2016 election.","The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russia’s role in the election.","In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about “fake news” and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation.","One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebook’s relationship with its users’ personal data “reminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.” At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca Pow questioned whether Facebook was a “massive surveillance operation.”","In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.","Craig TimbergCraig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Washington Post.

I mean, a lot. If you've ever been creeped out by a scarily on-point ad while visiting Facebook, that's why. But some of you might wonder where Facebook gets its data. The answer is simple: data brokers.","A data broker collects your information from various sources and depending on the broker in question, this information could come from online, offline, or both. Whenever you make a purchase online or utilize your grocery store's loyalty card, the data on your purchases is collected by at least one company. Facebook buys this data and, letting advertisers use it to more specifically target ads towards you. Though Facebook says that the data brokers anonymize what they collect, the details can still be matched against your Facebook profile, building for Facebook and its advertisers a complete picture of who you are.","Creepy, right?","There's some good news here, though. You can opt-out of this sort of data collection at a lot of data brokers including the companies with which Facebook has partnered. And you can do this on top of using security features such as limiting ad tracking on devices like your iPhone and iPad.","Who has your data","Right now, Facebook lists seven companies as \"Audience Data Providers\" on its Marketing Partners Program. These are the companies that currently provide data to Facebook from around the world:","Acxiom","Epsilon","Experian","Oracle Data Cloud","Quantium","KBM Group","CCC Marketing","The bad news is that these companies are Facebook's partners for now.

He said the FTC had dropped the ball in failing to enforce that.","But Chris Hoofnagle, faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, said that legal language in the consent decree would make it difficult for the government to show that Facebook had violated the agreement, because it allows Facebook to give the information of a user’s friends to third-party developers.","“The consent decree doesn’t give the FTC a lot of traction, but what’s going to happen is what happened in the first FTC case,” Hoofnagle said, referring to the investigation that resulted in the 2011 agreement. “The FTC went in investigating A, then discovered B, C, D, E, F and G. The same thing is going to happen here. They’re going to go in under the consent decree logic, and then they’re going to find other wrongdoing.”","Facebook is also facing questions over reports that it collected years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths and information about text messages from Android users.","Facebook said on Sunday that this information was uploaded to secure servers and came only from people who gave explicit consent to allow it.","Play Video","3:41","What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer","Officials said the data was not sold or shared with users’ friends or outside apps.

York: What #DeleteFacebook tech bros don't get: Without viable alternatives, walking away is still a privilege","text":["Jillian C. York is a writer and activist whose work examines the impact of technology on our societal and cultural values. Based in Berlin, she is the Director for International Freedom of Expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a fellow at the Center for Internet & Human Rights at the European University Viadrina.","The recent revelation that political data firm Cambridge Analytica harvested data from more than 50 million Americans via Facebook without their knowledge has sparked considerable and justifiable rage from many of the social network’s users. Calls for users to walk away from the platform abound — the #deletefacebook campaign has prompted tens of thousands of tweets, dozens of essays and such high-profile supporters as Elon Musk.","I get it. I’ve been on Facebook for about 13 years, and I’ve spent at least half of that time fed up with the company for mishandling my data, overzealously censoring expression and constantly making changes to their user interface and algorithms that never really seem like improvements. I’ve written and spoken about the pitfalls of trusting a corporation with managing our speech, and with handling our data, and I’ve long encouraged people to take action — both collective and personal — to fight for their privacy and speech rights.","Indeed, I’ve thought about walking away numerous times, but something — or rather, several things — keep me there: The convenience of being able to ping large groups of my friends all at once for some feedback or a couch to sleep on, the private groups and communities of friends and strangers that support each other, the event invitations to art openings and parties that I’d undoubtedly otherwise miss — and the list goes on.","I’m not a heavy user, and posts can only be seen by my friends, but I still find the site pretty integral to my social and community life. And yet, in conversations about what to do about Facebook's myriad problems, a certain demographic — namely, white men — love to argue that people worried about data privacy violations should “just leave” Facebook and other social networks. While happy to offer up their opinions, what these tech bros don't offer are viable alternatives.","This is fundamentally an argument made from a position of privilege. Those suggesting that we should simply walk away — without creating other options — fail to understand why leaving is, for many, a luxury they can’t afford.","The biggest reason is simple. The network effect — the phenomenon where increased numbers of people or participants improves the value of a good or service — means that being among the first in your friend group to leave can be lonely and not a lot of fun. And for people with marginalized identities, chronic illnesses, or families spread across the world, walking away means leaving behind a potentially vital safety net of support.","In certain parts of the world, Facebook’s centrality is even more profound. Small businesses that can’t afford to build a website or post billboard ads use Facebook to find customers. Plenty of artists and small media outlets rely on the platform to spread their work. And activists often rely on it to reach potential audiences through which to spread their messages or calls for demonstrations.","Those suggesting that we should simply walk away fail to understand why leaving is, for many, a luxury they can’t afford.","“Why not use email or the phone?” some bros recently asked me on Twitter. “What did we ever do before this platform that’s been around for only ten years?” others have queried, sarcasm dripping.","The idea of substituting a one-to-many platform with myriad features with two useful-but-outdated systems is to me, and any other professional who has to deal with the phone and email all day, ridiculous. And to those who suggest that because Facebook is still young, it can easily be passed up, I recommend an experiment in which all electronic payments must be made in cash and mobile smartphone users must revert to prototypes from 2005.","These suggestions not only fundamentally misunderstand why Facebook is so valuable to many people, but also the way that power functions. A few thousand individuals simply logging off sends a message, but it doesn’t solve the core issues at play. It’s also unlikely to change the underlying dynamics and control of Silicon Valley tech companies. Rather than merely demanding that everyone walk away en masse, we need to demand a better Facebook — and force changes where necessary via reform or regulation.","Let me be clear: I don’t oppose deleting Facebook per se. But if we want the rest of the company’s more than two billion users around the world to leave, then we need to start thinking about how we’re going to replace it. This means truly listening to people who are concerned about closing their accounts, acknowledging their experiences, and building tools (and movements) that can fulfill their needs.","Some of this work is already taking place. There are decentralized alternatives already out there — like diaspora and Mastodon — that show promise, but also come with their own drawbacks. There are movements pushing for more transparency, better privacy features and regulation. None of these solutions are a panacea, but all are great steps toward creating a safer internet for everyone — not just Elon Musk.","Jillian C.

The paper calls it Facebook's biggest data breach to date.","The details come from a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who said he worked with Aleksandr Kogan, a professor at Cambridge University, to obtain the data. Kogan created an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" that paid users to take a personality test. Participants had to sign in through their Facebook login and agree to let their data be used for academic purposes.","The app went beyond its seemingly stated scope, however, pulling in data from the friends lists of any test-takers. Facebook's platform policy only allows developers the use of friend data to enhance a user's personal experience. The app put that data, from more than 50 million profiles in all, to work instead.","All the data mined from the app became a vital piece of the software Cambridge Analytica used to profile United States voters and serve them with personalized ads ahead of the 2016 election. The U.K. firm has been credited in the past for playing a key role in Donald Trump's ascent to the White House.","\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,\" Wylie said.","According to The Observer, Facebook \"took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals\" after learning of the \"unprecedented\" data harvesting in late 2015. It's not clear why more drastic steps weren't taken back then, though yesterday's action is easier to decode.","Facebook's Friday suspension of Cambridge Analytica from the platform came four days after The Observer asked the social media company for comment on the whistleblower's story. Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, was also suspended while the investigation plays out.","Wylie provided The Observer with a dossier of evidence illustrating Cambridge Analytica's alleged misuse of the data, including emails, invoices, contracts, and bank transfers that point to the scope of what was harvested. Also in the dossier is an August 2016 letter from Facebook lawyers instructing Wylie to destroy any data collected by Global Science Research, Kogan's front company.","The letter arrived just a few days before Stephen K. Bannon, a part owner of Cambridge Analytica and former vice president of the company's board, signed on as Trump's campaign manager.","Facebook takes the position that data harvested by GSR and Cambridge Analytica doesn't qualify as a breach. In a statement given to The Observer, the social media company claims Kogan's app \"gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels\" but \"did not subsequently abide by our rules\" as the info was passed along to third parties.","The company also said Kogan's app was removed in 2015, and anyone with access to the data had to certify that it had been destroyed. That timing doesn't line up with Wylie's August 2016 letter, however.","\"We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,\" Facebook vice president Paul Grewal said in a statement.","Mashable\nis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Plaintiffs Comforte and Carr claim that they were inundated with unwanted election-based news as a result of Cambridge's alleged data mining and targeted messages.","The lawsuit alleges CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, LLC (\"Cambridge\") actively engaged in data mining, data brokerage, and data analysis for the purpose of influencing the 2016 United States presidential election. The lawsuit highlights how Facebook and Zuckerberg were warned of 3rd-party access to user data as early as 2011 in relation to an Ireland-based legal proceeding. While recommendations were made by the Ireland-based office of the Data Protection Commissioner (\"ODPC\") to prevent and limit the disclosure of sensitive personal information to 3rd parties. If the allegations surrounding Cambridge are true, it appears Facebook and Zuckerberg did not heed several of ODPC's warnings and recommendations. Notably, former Facebook executives who worked at Facebook around the time of ODPC left Facebook to work for Uber - which has been mired in privacy-based issues and twice delayed disclosures of data breaches.","Atlas Consumer Law has filed suit over concerns Cambridge Analytica improperly used the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users to help influence the 2016 election. Numerous sources suggest that Facebook failed to enact protocols to prevent this from occurring. Further, it appears Facebook did not do enough to ensure users' personal information was deleted once Facebook learned the information was being misused.","Atlas Consumer Law has filed suit to obtain declaratory relief and compensatory damages for Cambridge's mining and misuse of personal information without class members' consent. They are asking the court to declare the defendants' misuse of personal information was illegal and Atlas Consumer Law is asking the court to require defendants demonstrate the personal information has been deleted and not shared with any other entities.","The suit will also ask the court to require Facebook to modify its policies to prevent this misuse of data from ever happening again and to require Facebook to be more user-friendly and transparent in terms of how it explains 3rd-party apps.","Under no circumstances should a 3rd-party have been able to ask a Facebook member's personal information through a friend's use of a 3rd-party app. If it is learned through the discovery process that some type of default setting allowed this to happen, and/or Facebook failed to inform users their data could be accessed and mined through another friend's use of a third-party's application, this must never happen again.","For more information or to reach a representative of Atlas Consumer Law, call (312) 313-1613 today."],"isopubdate":""}

Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use.","Facebook said no passwords or “sensitive pieces of information” had been taken, though information about a user’s location was available to Cambridge.","So was Facebook hacked?","Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was not a data breach, because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes — and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account.","But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred “to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.” It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm.","Dr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.","An error has occurred. Please try again later.","You are already subscribed to this email.","Cambridge Analytica officials, after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data, changed their story last week. In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","But the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","What is Facebook doing in response?","The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan’s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan’s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed.","Facebook also said: “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”","In a further step, Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm “to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists.” It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr. Kogan had given a verbal commitment, while Mr. Wylie “thus far has declined.”","What are others saying?","Facebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica. Investors have not been pleased, sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday.","■ In Congress, Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have asked to hold a hearing on Facebook’s links to Cambridge Analytica. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, led by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected.","■ A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebook’s ties to Cambridge Analytica.","■ The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post. Facebook’s lack of disclosure on the harvesting of data could violate privacy laws in Britain and several states."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

On the other, I could see plainly how the data was being collected, packaged, and then sold to advertisers so that they could more effectively influence people, and this made me feel very uneasy.","I should say right now that I don’t feel that advertising is evil, nor do I think that tech companies are evil, nor do I hate capitalism. I also am not a journalist, so don’t expect some fancy data and graphs to back up my feelings here. Everything here is anecdotal, but I would like to feel that I know what I’m talking about having worked in ad sales and partnerships at Google, Twitter, Vine and Medium going back to 2003.","What I believe is that 2016 was a watershed year — the year we saw how the data footprint that we leave behind can be used against us.","What is coming out now about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica is a reckoning. We’re seeing how easily we can be manipulated when the most intimate details for our lives — our private thoughts, our feelings, and our desires — are known to companies and used without our explicit knowledge.","I hope this is the year that we start to draw harder boundaries, so we can prevent all of this from getting worse. In the words of the great songwriter Aimee Mann: it’s not going to stop until you wise up.","Back in 2008 I was working for Google. I’d been with the company from the infancy of CPC AdWords, through the purchase of YouTube, to the burgeoning threat of Facebook. And I was at a company summit in NYC to discuss the new world of social media and what it would mean for advertising.","We brought in a speaker who was one of the largest AdSense advertisers on YouTube, MySpace (!), and Facebook (back before FB had their own ad platform, app devs could run their own ads on app canvas pages).","With smug confidence, this advertiser (who was a young man in his early 20s) told us how easily he could peddle diet patches to young women, and what data points he used to target them. He was very eager to tell us all how much money he made on a daily basis.","I was horrified. And enraged. I could easily see where this was headed, and strangely, my dystopian fantasy looked something like where we are today, with an electorate subtly manipulated to believe that electing a reality TV star for president was a good idea. (Sometimes I’m glad David Foster Wallace isn’t alive right now because he would have throw up his hands and been like, yep, I can’t write anything more fucked up than this.)","I impulsively stormed out of the summit and wrote “If you don’t want to be evil, don’t be greedy” on a hallway whiteboard and left the building. A month later, I left the company. I was worried that Google was becoming too powerful, and I also was interested in social media, which I could see the company didn’t understand at that time.","I had set my sights on a small but quickly growing social network named Friendfeed, which was created by a group of ex-Google product managers and engineers. And I loved it. It had everything: a vibrant group of technologists who loved sharing interesting ideas and information, a real-time news feed with social feedback (they invented “liking”), multi-platform aggregation, media uploading…the list goes on. It was the social platform that Google should have built.","Friendfeed was the next big thing. It was the future. I flew out to Mountain View twice and begged the founders to hire me. But they didn’t have use for my skill set at the time — no need for people with an ad sales background — but I still was an active member of the community and kept my eye on them constantly, hoping there would be an opportunity to work with them.","But then in August of 2009, Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook bought Friendfeed, which really, really, really pissed me off.","I knew then that there was no way Friendfeed was going to stay an independent platform. Its technology would be absorbed, and our small Friendfeed community would disperse. And that’s exactly what happened. Friendfeed became the Facebook News Feed that we all know and love today. And like a black hole, Facebook continued its strategic land grab of start-ups and technology companies.","My attention turned to Twitter, which I didn’t like nearly as much as Friendfeed. It was really difficult to get anyone to engage with you on Twitter unless you already had a large following or were famous in IRL, which is still a problem that Twitter has never really solved. I think it accounts, in part, for the tradition of trolling and abuse on the platform — one easy and quick way you can get people to pay attention to you is to be as outrageously awful as possible, and you may at least get a defensive response from someone, finally. Infamy will alway trump the shame of invisibility, I guess!","In 2010 I joined Twitter after Dick Costolo became CEO. I had a lot of respect for Dick after working briefly with him at Google. He had headed up Feedburner, which Google had acquired in 2007. I had felt that Feedburner’s ad model had brought an important piece of the social media puzzle to Google (which they squandered), and if Dick was joining Twitter, things there probably weren’t going to go badly. I also was a fan of Blogger and Ev Williams’ thoughtful approach to technology.","When Twitter launched its ads business, I threw myself behind the success of the company and its advertising because I didn’t want the company to fall in the gigantic shadow of Facebook and be absorbed like Friendfeed. The technology industry, more so than any other industry, needs viable competitors, and it made me nervous to see Facebook alone in its category, with Google still lagging behind on the social front.","The early years selling ads for Twitter were painful. For one, we weren’t Facebook. We didn’t have nearly the scale of Facebook, and our ad targeting capabilities were pathetic compared to Facebook’s. I can’t tell you how many advertisers would say to us, “Well, on Facebook I can target by gender, age, income, relationship status, zip code, number of household children…” which was hard to counter when our only unique value proposition was buying a trending hashtag that didn’t even include geotargeting.","As the ad business matured at Twitter, it was a constant push and pull for the company, trying to reach some parity with Facebook’s targeting and size while still maintaining user privacy, which was something the executives truly cared about and strongly advocated for, to the chagrin of the ad sales team that kept losing big buys to Facebook. Twitter’s ad platform now is light years more advanced than the one I used when I left the company in 2015, but it’s still having to carve out its business from the scraps of Google and Facebook.","It’s really, really, really hard to compete against Facebook’s ad platform, guys. Not only is everyone and their mom on Facebook, but the depth and breadth of the data people give to Facebook properties is mind-boggling. Couple that with off-site data (Catalina, Comscore, etc) they cross reference with their own first-party data, and you have basically enough reference points to create complete psychological profiles of the majority of people on the planet.","And in order to even attempt to be competitive, new companies that try to sell ads on their content are pressured to compile and sell as much user data as they can.","I saw this first-hand at Medium, where I worked briefly in 2016 trying to help build their ad platform to support independent writers and publications. Although I wasn’t privy to any high-level conversations the decision-makers had at Medium, I can imagine that after our sales team demonstrated to Ev what data Medium would need to be give away in order to be remotely competitive with Facebook, he was like, “Fuck this shit,” and fired us all. Which is what ended up happening. And while it sucked to get laid off, I was neither surprised nor angry, and I respected him for trying again to make subscriptions work.","Here’s the whole point to me telling you all this self-indulgent personal history about working at tech companies: what’s going on right now with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica is very serious and very important, and my hope is that our legislators understand its gravity and come together to figure out reasonable boundaries and exclosures for data collection and sales before it gets even worse. Market pressure for exponential revenue growth is too draconian for the industry to curb itself — there will always be an appetite for more and more data to collect and sell, and there will always be nefarious players who will use it for destructive ends."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

The letter also instructs Zuckerberg to \"direct your staff\" to brief the committee about the controversy.","The letter to Zuckerberg, sent by Thune and Sens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Jerry Moran, R-Kan., requests information relating to data reportedly obtained by Strategic Communications Laboratories Group and its affiliate, Cambridge Analytica.","Facebook on Friday confirmed that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica from operating on its platforms as it investigated whether the firm failed to delete information that Cambridge Analytica had received through an academic researcher.","\"Consumers rely on platforms like Facebook to be transparent and truthful in their terms of service so consumers can make informed decisions about whether to consent to the sharing and use of their data,” the senators wrote in their letter to Zuckerberg.","“We appreciate that Facebook has recently taken steps to address this situation. Nevertheless, the possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers, or has not been able to verify that third party app developers are transparent with consumers, is troubling,\" the senators wrote.","The Commerce committee leaders sent a separate letter to Strategic Communications Laboratories Group CEO Nigel Oakes requesting information and a briefing related to the use and sharing of individual Facebook user data.","Earlier Monday, two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Republican John Kennedy of Louisiana, asked Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa., to hold a hearing so senators can publicly grill Zuckerberg and other social media CEOs.","\"Facebook, Google, and Twitter have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data and use this data when selling advertising, including political advertisements,\" the senators wrote in a letter to Grassley. \"The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights.\"","Cambridge Analytica says it relies on personality surveys and thousands of pieces of data on each American to create \"psychographic\" profiles to predict how people will vote. The firm worked on President Trump's 2016 campaign and has had financial backing from hedge-fund billionaire and Trump supporter Robert Mercer and his family.","On Monday afternoon, Grassley spokesman George Hartmann said the senator is taking the request from Klobuchar and Kennedy \"under advisement\" but has not decided whether to summon the tech CEOs to Washington for a hearing.","Even before news reports emerged in recent days about the potential misuse of Facebook data, federal regulators and Congress grappled with social media's growing influence on U.S. elections and the ways in which Russian operatives used the platforms to attempt to sow social unrest ahead of the 2016 presidential contest.","Digital ads are skyrocketing","During the last midterm election in 2014, digital advertising accounted for less than 1% of political spending in federal, states and local elections, according to advertising tracking firm Borrell Associates. In this election cycle, the firm predicts digital advertising will soar to about 22% — or $1.9 billion — of the more than $8 billion that it estimates will be spent on political ads.","Social media allows politicians and others trying to influence elections to target particular voters at a relatively low cost compared to television or radio ads that reach a broader audience, said Borrell executive Kip Cassino.","\"People are turning away from the idea of sending your messages out to a whole bunch of people and hoping that some of them will gravitate toward it,\" Cassino said. \"Instead, they are choosing to talk with people who already agree with their messages or are likely to agree.\"","The federal government, however, has struggled to catch up with the fast-changing media environment. Television broadcasters, for instance, are subject to Federal Communications Commission rules that require them to publicly detail who bought ads on their stations and how much they spent.","Facebook, Twitter and other social networks do not face similar requirements.","Just last week, the Federal Election Commission, which regulates political campaign activity, voted to begin writing rules that detail the kinds of disclaimers they will require on online and mobile political ads to identify sponsors.","The agency last wrote broad rules on Internet advertising in 2006.","Online political advertising was seen \"initially as a force for good,\" because it offered a lower cost way for candidates to advertise and could serve as a counterweight to the influence of big political donors, said Ellen Weintraub, a veteran Democratic commission member who now serves as its vice chairwoman","\"Now, we know it isn't universally good,\" she told USA TODAY in a Monday interview. \"There are risks here.\"","Last November, angry senators warned attorneys for Facebook, Twitter and Google that they must do more to prevent Russian manipulation of their social media platforms or Congress would be forced to impose new rules to help people identify malicious content. Attorneys for the three social media giants testified before the House and Senate intelligence committees last Nov. 1 about how Russia exploited their platforms to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. Lawmakers expressed disappointment back then that the companies had sent their attorneys rather than their CEOs.","\"This (the Cambridge Analytica news) is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, a former tech entrepreneur who serves as vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\"","On Monday morning, Facebook officials said they were undertaking an audit into the allegations about Cambridge Analytica. An update on Facebook's blog said later that independent forensic auditors from Stroz Friedberg were on site at Cambridge Analytica’s London office on Monday evening. However, the Facebook blog reported: \"At the request of the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, which has announced it is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation, the Stroz Friedberg auditors stood down.\"","\"We have a pretty good track record as a company of — once we set our mind to doing something — we eventually get it done,\" Zuckerberg told USA TODAY in a November interview. But, he conceded, \"I don't know how long it will take to address this.\"","Warner and Klobuchar said the latest revelations underscore the need for Congress to quickly pass the Honest Ads Act, a bipartisan bill that they introduced with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to require Facebook, Twitter, Google and other social media companies to disclose who is paying for political ads that appear on their online platforms.","Facebook disclosed last September that it had identified more than $100,000 worth of political ads purchased by a Russian company linked to the Kremlin. Most of the 3,000 ads, which ran between June 2015 and May 2017, focused on divisive issues such as immigration, gun control, gay rights and race.","The Honest Ads Act would require social media companies to follow the same rules as radio, television and print media when it comes to public disclosure of who is sponsoring political ads.","An identical bill has been introduced in the House by Reps. Derek Kilmer, D-Wash., and Mike Coffman, R-Colo.","However, there have so far been no hearings or votes on the bill in either chamber. The Republican-led Congress has generally been reluctant to impose any new regulations on business.","Meredith McGehee, executive director of the Issue One watchdog group, helped draft the Honest Ads proposals. She also blamed the stalemate on partisanship, particularly as lawmakers prepare to face voters in November.","\"Right now, if you use the words 'social media' in the context of the election, it's assumed you are espousing an anti-Trump message,\" she said, \"so it scares away most Republicans.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

Maybe even enough to fuel a voter-manipulation effort like the one a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm stands accused of — and which Facebook may have enabled.","The social network is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections.","Monday was a wild roller coaster ride for Facebook, whose shares plunged 7 percent in its worst one-day decline since 2014. Officials in the EU and the U.S. sought answers, while Britain's information commissioner said she will seek a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica's servers because the British firm had been \"uncooperative\" in her investigation. The first casualty of that investigation was an audit of Cambridge that Facebook had announced earlier in the day; the company said it \"stood down\" that effort at the request of British officials.","Adding to the turmoil, the New York Times reported that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will step down by August following clashes over how aggressively Facebook should address its role in spreading disinformation. In a tweet , Stamos said he's still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed.","It would have been quieter had Facebook likes not turned out to be so revealing. Researchers in a 2013 study found that likes on hobbies, interests and other attributes can predict personal attributes such as sexual orientation and political affiliation. Computers analyze such data to look for patterns that might not be obvious, such as a link between a preference for curly fries and higher intelligence.","Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, said the firm used such techniques to learn about individuals and create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. In doing so, he said, the firm \"took fake news to the next level.\"","\"This is based on an idea called 'informational dominance,' which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what's actually happening,\" Wylie said Monday on NBC's \"Today.\" It's not yet clear exactly how the firm might have attempted to do that.","Late Friday, Facebook said Cambridge improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded an app described as a personality test. Those people agreed to share data with the app for research — not for political targeting. And the data included who their Facebook friends were and what they liked — even though those friends hadn't downloaded the app or given explicit consent.","Cambridge got limited information on the friends, but machines can use detailed answers from smaller groups to make good inferences on the rest, said Kenneth Sanford of the data science company Dataiku.","Cambridge was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, and at one point employed Stephen Bannon — later President Donald Trump's campaign chairman and White House adviser — as a vice president. The Trump campaign paid Cambridge roughly $6 million according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work.","The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common, but is typically used to sell diapers and other products. Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person's viewing behaviors fit with what other customers watch.","But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it's connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media.","Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to \"explore mental vulnerabilities of people.\" He said the firm \"works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.\"","Wylie told \"Today\" that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge effort aimed to make sure people wouldn't know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.","The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge's data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing, and says it didn't retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn't use it in its 2016 campaign work.","Yet Cambridge boasted of its work after another client, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, won the Iowa caucus in 2016.","Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz from similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use.","Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages. For voters who care about tradition, it could push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might have described keeping guns for protection against crime.","It's possible that Cambridge tapped other data sources, including what Cruz's campaign app collected. Nix said during the Cruz campaign that it had five or six sources of data on each voter.","Facebook declined to provide officials for interview and didn't immediately respond to requests for information beyond its statements Friday and Monday. Cambridge also didn't immediately respond to emailed questions.","Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. Facebook's mapping of the \"social graph\" — essentially the web of people's real-life connections — is also invaluable for marketers.","For example, researchers can look at people's clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. People who bridge different friend networks, for example, can have more influence when they post something, making them prime for targeting.","Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according on Pew Research Center. While people don't exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the \"rabbit hole\" of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described.","___","An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the sum paid by the 2016 Trump campaign to Cambridge Analytica. It was $5.9 million according to federal election records."],"isopubdate":""}

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.","Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.","Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.","Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.","The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.","One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.","“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.","Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.","Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.","Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”","Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.","By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”","In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.","Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.","A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.","Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”","But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.","By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.","In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”","And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.","The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.","Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”","“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”","Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.","By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.","Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.","Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.","After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.","Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.","“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}
{"originalurl":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/innovation-cambridge-analytica-topias-uotila/","title":"The Innovation of Cambridge Analytica  | LinkedIn","text":["The Innovation of Cambridge Analytica","Sign in to follow this author","Introduction","Recentrevelations on the implementation of both the Brexit and Trump campaigns have brought forth a company called Cambridge Analytica (CA). As both of the campaigns lead to surprise victories aided by novel appearing methods of campaigning, people have been ready to tout microtargeting as an unstoppable innovation and the end of democracy. The purpose of this article is to explain in my words what microtargeting is and what really is the innovation in these campaigns.","There are two main challenges with applying extreme microtargeting – cost and availability of relevant data. With traditional media, the bigger problem has been costs. While the analysis of the market to gather segmentation variables is somewhat costly, it is usually the communication with the target segment that costs the most money. More precisely the distribution of messaging has eaten the lion’s share. Now, as long as your selected number of target segments doesn’t grow, the cost of distribution diminishes as your segment narrows. Immediately as you split your communication to more than one segment, your cost of content production and distribution sky rockets. Or that’s especially how it used to be with traditional media.","You have no mountains in New York City.","Second problem with microtargeting is the discovery of meaningful variables to segment with. Every marketer has always wanted to only target those persons who, for example, like to travel, compete with their friends over status or support classical family values. In reality they’ve been left with the possibility of only finding proxies for these attitudes, values and lifestyles or simply selecting demographic and geographic groups like males aged 50 to 55 in Helsinki. Ten years ago, there was a lot of discussion on how these better “soft” attributes could be found and the most common tactic was based on surveys. The problem with surveys is that while the generalization from the sample to the whole population is ok, the deep dive back into a selected segment isn’t.","Let’s take an example, by randomly selecting 100 spots in United States, you get an idea of how much roads, forests, lakes, cities etc. there are in total. But if you now try to apply this same knowledge to a local area, say to an individual city, you are way off. You simply have no mountains in New York City. This didn’t stop all marketers, but basically random sample surveys are good for understanding a segment, but not really in further segmenting it.","Use incognito or private browsing mode!","The first smallish innovation of CA was to gather the data not as a survey of a sample, but by utilizing social media and actually getting the results from almost everyone in the segment. This isn’t super innovative, though. When was the last time, you answered a leadership style quiz on Facebook or wanted to see how the much on average you make versus your neighbors in a Helsingin Sanomat test? Is it possible that some of the providers beside CA save the answers?","But isn’t Microtargeting a Political Innovation?","Well, if microtargeting was the real innovation in the political context, we should’ve been talking about this 12 years ago when Bush got re-elected in 2004. Even Wikipedia lists this as the first US national election usage of these tactics. In elections with multiple persons getting elected precise, or even micro-, targeting has always been the de facto choice. When you don’t need more than 1 % of the vote, why wouldn’t you build a small target group? In this sense, elections where you aim for a majority are quite hard for microtargeting as the number of small segments needed for a 50 % majority is huge. The problem is circumvented by not trying to influence anyone except the moving voters, and with a federal system, only in the swing states.","The Innovation","My purpose is not to say CA couldn’t be an innovative company. There’s more than likely advanced technological capabilities that have led to them being the selected partner for Mercer and friends. It is by no means trivial to handle databases with a hundred million individuals with probably hundreds of variables. It is also very difficult to make the logical jump from noticing Facebook likes on, say, Pepsi and Kendall Jenner, to deducing the person might be able to pacify riot police, and finally to sending them a fully produced a video that triggers such behavior. In fact, it’s so difficult even Pepsi failed. These skills just aren’t the ones people are afraid of when they discuss microtargeting.","The real innovation doesn’t lie with CA","– it is lies.","Strategic communication circles and marketers have lived mostly under the assumption of truth and the dissemination of truth. The common belief has been that a single brand can’t have very different target groups with conflicting messaging as the groups will encounter each other’s messages. The target groups will leak. A good example here is the need for starting separate luxury brands like Nokia’s Vertu. Now you might be thinking Apple doesn’t need a separate brand, but that’s because Apple is a high-end brand to begin with and doesn’t really compete over market shares above 25 %.","The innovation in the Brexit and Trump campaigns with CA was that the prevalence of truth is a false assumption. One doesn’t need to be coherent or truthful in the microtargeted messages. The information overflow of today makes sure the recipients won’t be able to really dissect and cross-examine the messaging. Also the trust in truth overall can be weakened, especially when the target is to get persons to not vote at all. And finally, as we’re looking for an emotional response, the messaging can be send so close to the h-hour, it doesn’t matter, if after the vote, the recipients realize there might’ve been something fishy in the messaging.","There is way too little discussion on the emotional triggering aspect of information operations","It is also good to note that CA and similar companies are employing psychological operations experts from the military. However, I’m arguing there are more skills in the commercial sector. The private sector had about a ten-year lead in starting to apply these microtargeting skills. A good example of the gap is this effort by NATO or the US exercise I talked about at Disobey.","Closing Remarks","One needs to remember that targeting in itself can actually be a positive thing. Every customer wants to be treated as an individual, nobody likes spam and everyone is interested in information that helps their lives. It is the evil intent that makes targeting a problem and microtargeting is a more effective form of it. Targeting itself is just an agnostic process or a tool. Guns don’t kill people, rappers do."],"isopubdate":"2017-05-11"}

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

The company, which was already facing scrutiny for selling ads to foreign groups seeking to disrupt the 2016 U.S. presidential election and inadvertently facilitating the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories, is getting hammered for allowing the profile data of 50 million Americans to be used by political operatives without users’ consent.","The group that used the data, Cambridge Analytica, did so to create and spread highly targeted advertisements seeking to elect Donald Trump and discredit Hillary Clinton in the lead up to the presidential election. But the organization received that information through questionable means, according to the New York Times.","The entire mess might have you wondering how you can control who sees your data on Facebook, or even how to delete your profile entirely. If that’s the case, I’ve got you covered.","Here’s how to control your data on Facebook, and, if you’re particularly fed up, how to delete your account entirely.","The data Facebook uses","Facebook lays out exactly what data it collects to craft a profile about you that can be used to target you with specific ads on its Data Use Policy site. And, as you might expect, it collects everything. Any post, like, comment, picture, video, friend you’ve added, news article or inside joke you’ve put on Facebook can be used as a means to serve you advertisements.","Facebook uses your personal information to match you up with various advertisements on the social network.","Facebook can also use data like your date of birth, location and other information to provide you with ads you might find relevant, and improve the site itself.","Think of it as the built-in cost of using a massive service like Facebook for free.","It’s not just the information you share on Facebook that gets scooped up, though. All of those sites and services you log into using your Facebook account have access to some of your data, and how they handle that info is up to them.","Then there’s the content friends post about you. Yes, all of those pictures, memes and stories your friends tag you in get collected by Facebook, too. And unfortunately, you don’t have control of that information since you didn’t post it.","It’s important to note that Facebook isn’t the only company that collects and uses your data like this. Google (GOOG,GOOGL) and Twitter (TWTR) also use information about you to determine which advertisements to show you and help advertisers better target their campaigns.","Controlling your data","Facebook considers information you share publicly to be fair game for use with targeted advertisements. And while you can change the visibility of some of your data such as posts and photos, information like your name, profile picture and cover photo, networks, gender, username and user ID (how apps identify you) are always considered public.","If you want to see fewer ads regarding a specific topic on Facebook, you can visit the Facebook Ad Preferences site. From here, you can control what kind of information Facebook thinks it knows about you. You won’t actually be able to delete that data, but you’ll be able to control the kinds of ads you see.","For example, Facebook recognizes that I’ve interacted with pages about action role-playing games, Hulu, the Wall Street Journal and others. If I no longer want to see ads about those topics, I can simply click the “X” icon in the top right corner of each interest.","You can delete categories that Facebook thinks you have interest in to stop seeing ads on specific topics.","You can also remove yourself from categories that Facebook matches you up with that help advertisers serve you certain ads. Facebook, for instance, lists me as being an engaged shopper, commuter, console gamer and early adopter. I can, however, remove myself from those categories to stop seeing ads based on that content.","Similarly, you can choose to prevent Facebook from showing you online interest-based ads or ads on apps and websites by opting out of these settings.","Then there are apps including games and services like Spotify that can access your basic Facebook profile information. If you never want to use those services again, you can disable them from your Facebook account by turning off Facebook Platform applications. Once you do that, these outside apps will no longer have access to your profile data.","If you revoke access Spotify’s access to your Facebook profile, you’ll need to create a new Spotify login.","For apps like Spotify, which allows you to log in with your Facebook account, you’ll need to cancel your Facebook-based profile and start a new one with a standard login.","Deleting Facebook","Of course, if you’re completely at the end of your rope when it comes to Facebook, you can simply choose to erase your presence from the service by deleting your account. Before you do so, though, it’s worth noting that getting rid of your Facebook account also means you’ll be cutting yourself off from a large chunk of your online social circle.","You won’t be able to spy on that one guy who dumped you in high school or call out Brad when he tells you he was too sick to hang out last night, but still managed to post pictures of himself at the bar with Sharon.","If you’re willing to give that up, along with the ability to send and receive invitations to various parties, which is why I primarily use the service, then you can take the leap and say goodbye to your account.","Before you do that, though, you should know that deleting your account means saying goodbye to all of those photos and videos you’ve uploaded to the service over the years. To save those, you can download your Facebook archive by navigating to the Settings menu from the Facebook desktop site.","Next, click “General” and select “Download a copy of your Facebook data” at the bottom of the page. This will ensure you have access to everything you’ve posted on the site since you originally joined.","Now you can delete your account. To do so you’ll need to follow this link, as Facebook seems to purposely make it difficult to end your relationship with the site.","Click “Delete my Account,” and you’ll see a pop-up window asking you if you’re sure you want to delete your profile. You’ll then need to enter your password and fill out a Captcha to confirm your decision.","Facebook seems to purposely make it hard to delete your account.","It could take up to 90 days for Facebook to fully delete all of the information you’ve uploaded to its servers. During that time, no one will be able to interact with your account.","Unfortunately, some things won’t be deleted during this process including posts you’ve been tagged in or messages you’ve previously sent to friends.","And that’s that. You’re now done with Facebook forever. Unless, that is, you’ve got Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram, all of which are owned by Facebook.","Come on. You didn’t really think it would be that easy to leave, did you?"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-20"}

Newspaper reports that a UK political consultancy used millions of user profiles creates fresh risks at the social network he founded. People are already spending less time on Facebook. The danger is that members may unfriend it altogether.","Facebook lost more than $35 billion of its value on Monday after reports said that more than 50 million people had their personal data misappropriated by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The firm used the Facebook trove, obtained without authorization, to build a software program to influence voters, including in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to the New York Times and Observer of London.","Multiple investigations have been opened in the United States and Europe as a result - just as Facebook scrambles to address earlier challenges involving fake-news and ad-measurement mishaps. The controversy hasn’t yet shaken the confidence of Madison Avenue, which is still shoveling money to Facebook. Revenue rose 47 percent last year to $41 billion.","The debacles may be taking a toll in other ways though. Zuckerberg said at his last quarterly earnings presentation that the aggregate time users spent on the social network was falling by 50 million hours every day. Advertisers often turn to how long people hang around as a sign of engagement.","And although the number of daily active users in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent year-over-year, to 1.4 billion globally, cracks are starting to appear in key markets. In the United States and Canada, members dipped by 1 million in the fourth quarter from the preceding three months, to 184 million, while in Europe member growth has slowed significantly. Those regions generated nearly 75 percent of the company’s fourth-quarter revenue.","Like MySpace before it, Facebook’s long-term dominance is by no means assured. New research from eMarketer estimates that Facebook’s share of the U.S. digital-ad market will slip slightly over the next two years as user growth slows and pricing for ads reaches its limits.

They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

As TechCrunch explained when the data partnership first launched:","“Through new partnerships with top online and offline purchase data providers Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai, Facebook is now allowing advertisers to target hashed lists of existing and potential customers, and categories like role-playing gamers or soda drinkers.”","Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that the change is permanent, not a temporary precaution.

The decision was issued in light of the company’s recent privacy concerns over third-party data mishandling.","Facebook Product Marketing Director Graham Mudd elaborated on the decision in a statement:","“We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories. This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.”","Facebook clarified that it will still work with companies like Experian and Acxiom in order to measure ad performance and provide metrics, although it will also be conducting a review of those ongoing relationships. Facebook may also move toward sharing data in a shared server environment in order to offer further assurances of user privacy.

Wylie also alleges that Cambridge Analytica used data harvested from more than 50-million Facebook users to help U.S. President Donald Trump win the 2016 election.","Wylie told the digital, culture, media and sport committee of the U.K. Parliament that he \"absolutely\" believed AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica's databases for its work on the official Vote Leave campaign.","\"I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning,'' he said.","The campaign appears to have previously verified the company's role in its success.","\"Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ.

{"originalurl":"https://www.wired.com/story/fb-data-restrictions-hobble-researchers/","title":"Facebook’s New Data Restrictions Will Handcuff Even Honest Researchers | WIRED","text":["But then Cambridge Analytica happened, and gave a lot of researchers a scare: Tapping into Facebook's data is already more onerous than many of them would like. How would the company's reaction to one of its most devastating public disasters to date affect their access going forward?","On Wednesday, they got their first trace of an answer. In a post published to his Facebook wall, Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged his company's failure to protect its users' data and outlined how the social network would protect that data going forward. Of relevance to researchers is the second step in Facebook's three-part plan:","...we will restrict developers' data access even further to prevent\nother kinds of abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access\nto your data if you haven't used their app in 3 months. We will reduce\nthe data you give an app when you sign in – to only your name,\nprofile photo, and email address. We'll require developers to not only\nget approval but also sign a contract in order to ask anyone for\naccess to their posts or other private data. And we'll have more\nchanges to share in the next few days.","To understand how these changes could affect research, it helps to understand the ways scientists can currently gain access to Facebook's user data.","Method one is obvious: Work at Facebook. It used to be companies would farm out data analysis to third parties, but Facebook can afford to employ psychologists, sociologists, and data scientists full time. That's not to say company employees are given carte blanche: No Facebook employee has access to all the company's data all the time. To its credit, Facebook has an internal ethics review process for vetting company research, which means access to information is granted on a need-to-use basis and subject to auditing. (This policy was created in reaction to Facebook's notorious emotional contagion study, another of the company's missteps.) According to a former member of Facebook's Core Data Science team who declined to be named for this story, this process is rigorously policed. \"If you went digging around in anything you clearly weren't supposed to, you'd be fired.\"","Method two is to partner with Facebook as a collaborator in some official capacity. Which can mean a number of different things. For example, Facebook recently granted Stanford economist Raj Chetty and a team of researchers access to a trove of de-identified user data, to aid his investigations on income inequality in America. (Those shocking New York Times infographics on the fate of black boys in America? They're based on Chetty's work.)","But Chetty's relationship with Facebook is pretty unique. One of the more typical ways that Facebook collaborates with academia is to hire PhD candidates as paid interns, making them fixed-term, full time employees. That also means they sign all the things employees sign, including intellectual property and nondisclosure agreements. The PhD student may spend a lot of time with raw data, but any and all analysis happens entirely on Facebook infrastructure. And when the candidate’s internship comes to an end, Facebook’s privacy and policy teams ensure any data they take with them—to continue working towards a publication for example—exists only in aggregate form. (Another related mode of collaboration is to hire researchers as contractors; they, too, get access—and NDAs.)","The third level of access is to tap into Facebook's data through its API. This is how psychologist Aleksandr Kogan acquired information on some 50 million Facebook users, via an app-based quiz called thisismydigitallife. Researchers still use apps to collect data from users who agree to participate in studies—albeit far less than they could when Kogan did, back in 2014. The language in Zuckerberg's post indicates Facebook will restrict app-based data access even further going forward, though it doesn't designate the extent of that restriction, or how it will apply to researchers, specifically.","\"I think the primary concern for Facebook with that sort of thing would be more with respect to app developers and corporations, but it could certainly affect scientists as a byproduct,\" says MIT social scientist Dean Eckles, whose research often incorporates data from Facebook. It could also mean more paperwork for anyone looking to access data through the API—which isn't necessarily a bad thing; legitimate researchers, Eckles says, \"will be largely willing to jump through those hoops.\"","Less clear is how Facebook's restrictions will impact researchers not conducting app-based research. Solomon Messing, director of Pew Research Center's Data Labs, relies on Facebook's API to study the effects of congressional rhetoric on the platform. \"We’re interested in constituent communication, how their audience responds to different forms of messages, and the API gives us the ability to get the text of what members say and user engagement data—likes, comments, shares, stuff like that.\" He says whether Facebook's crackdown affects his research will depend on specifics—how the company chooses to restrict data access, and what kinds of approval processes he'll need to go through moving forward. \"But I would hope that academic researchers will be able to access whatever is necessary for them to do their research in an ethical and legal way.\"","Oh, and some transparency would be nice, too, says Catherine Brooks, director of the Center for Digital Society and Data Studies at the University of Arizona. \"There’s an entire world of knowledge inside Facebook, and questions we can’t answer unless we have access to the data,\" she says. \"But the public also needs more information about how that data is being collected and used, and an opportunity to consent to provide it.\"","The challenge for Facebook will be allocating the resources necessary to make it happen. The company currently possesses some of the best social data in the world. Is its chief obligation to share it or protect it? Responsible researchers think the answer is yes."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-23"}

The danger is that members may unfriend it altogether.","Facebook lost more than $35 billion of its value on Monday after reports said that more than 50 million people had their personal data misappropriated by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The firm used the Facebook trove, obtained without authorization, to build a software program to influence voters, including in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to the New York Times and Observer of London.","Multiple investigations have been opened in the United States and Europe as a result - just as Facebook scrambles to address earlier challenges involving fake-news and ad-measurement mishaps. The controversy hasn’t yet shaken the confidence of Madison Avenue, which is still shoveling money to Facebook. Revenue rose 47 percent last year to $41 billion.","The debacles may be taking a toll in other ways though. Zuckerberg said at his last quarterly earnings presentation that the aggregate time users spent on the social network was falling by 50 million hours every day. Advertisers often turn to how long people hang around as a sign of engagement.","And although the number of daily active users in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent year-over-year, to 1.4 billion globally, cracks are starting to appear in key markets.

{"originalurl":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/17/trump-campaign-linked-data-firm-cambridge-analytica-reportedly-collected-info-on-50m-facebook-profiles/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","title":"Trump campaign-linked data firm Cambridge Analytica reportedly collected info on 50M Facebook profiles – TechCrunch","text":["Cambridge Analytica had worked with University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, who had developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” and obtained user information — which the Times is reporting scooped up information on profiles of as many as 50 million users. Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to users’ geographic information. But just one person — with hundreds of friends — allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today.","In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach — though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said:","Update: Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation.","I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in.","I'm going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018.","Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on the right 50 million people could have made a huge difference.","While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwups and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort. Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014.","To be sure, It does not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important.","Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries.","This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.","We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Mueller III against 13 individuals and three organizations accused of interfering with the U.S. election offer perhaps the most powerful evidence yet that Facebook and its Instagram subsidiary are harming public health and democracy. The best option for the company — and for democracy — is for Facebook to change its business model from one based on advertising to a subscription service.","Facebook has insisted that it bears no responsibility for the consequences of its design choices, despite voluminous evidence that bad actors are exploiting the platform’s design to harm innocent people and undermine democracy around the world. If there was any doubt about this before the indictment, there can be none now.","The document outlines how Russia’s Internet Research Agency used Facebook and Instagram as its preferred platforms to gather American followers, spread misinformation and organize events — all with the goal of sowing discord, influencing voters and electing Donald Trump. Facebook and Instagram are mentioned 41 times.","Facebook’s advertising business model is hugely profitable, but the incentives are perverse. Using a variety of psychological techniques derived from propaganda and the design of gambling systems, Facebook grabs and holds user attention better than any advertising platform before it. Intensive surveillance enables customization for each of its 2.1 billion users. Algorithms maximize engagement by appealing to emotions such as fear and anger. Facebook groups intensify preexisting beliefs, increasing polarization.","And thanks to the ubiquity of smartphones, more than a billion of Facebook’s users log on to the site every day — a habit no one had 14 years ago. As a result, many have come to identify with ideas that are manifestly not true. It is no exaggeration to say that Facebook’s business model may qualify as parasitic.","Despite a firestorm of criticism, Facebook refuses to make material changes to its business practices. It has also refused to provide substantive data about Russian interference to congressional committees, despite several requests. As a result, we can expect interference in the upcoming midterm elections. Anyone can follow the Russian playbook; many are likely to do so.","None of this is necessary. Facebook could adopt a business model that does not depend on surveillance, addiction and manipulation: subscriptions. Facebook is uniquely positioned to craft the online equivalent of cable television, combining basic services with a nearly unlimited number of premium offerings that could include news, television and even movies. Facebook could be the Comcast of Cord Cutters.","I suspect that the vast majority of users believe that Facebook’s news feed is not as good as it used to be. The advertising load has risen dramatically in recent years, displacing many messages from family and close friends. Addicted customers continue to use Facebook, but they aren’t as happy.","Facebook has disclosed that it generated $82.44 of advertising revenue per user in the United States and Canada over the past year. To match this revenue with a subscription business model, Facebook would need to charge $6.87 per month. In comparison, Netflix offers three streaming plans, at $8, $11 and $14 per month. Consumers spend more time per month on Netflix today than Facebook, but that may reflect product design, rather than value. With a subscription-oriented approach, Facebook could easily overtake Netflix in usage, as well as value.","A subscription model would allow Facebook to improve the user experience dramatically. For example, the basic bundle might include multiple news feeds, such as unfiltered feeds for family, friends and any number of groups, as well as news feeds organized by topic, including news, politics, sports and music. Premium news feeds could include newspapers, magazines, blogs and podcasts, each curated by the publisher. There could also be video news feeds for HBO, Netflix or regional sports networks, as well as audio news feeds for Spotify and Pandora. A cord cutter with a full suite of premium news feeds might spend as much on Facebook per month as a premium cable customer spends today — $100 or more. Facebook would take a piece of the revenue from every premium service.","Facebook could implement a subscription model with no customer acquisition cost because 223 million adults in the United States already use Facebook, roughly equal to cable and satellite television. With the accelerating trend toward cord cutting, Facebook is ideally positioned to win the battle for customers who get their media services over the Internet.","There’s also flexibility in rolling out this business model: For example, Facebook might allow customers to choose between its current model and subscriptions. Customers who remained on the advertising-supported service would still be subject to filter bubbles, addiction and manipulation, but growth in subscriptions would reduce the population of affected people.","Subscription services could be implemented not only in the United States but also in most of the developed world. This wouldn’t just be good for Facebook. It would be good for America and for democracy globally."],"isopubdate":"2018-02-21"}

The Senate Judiciary Committee urged Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who chairs the committee, to call on Zuckerberg to testify about the recent alleged misuse of 50 million Facebook users’ data. Grassley confirmed that he asked the Facebook CEO to testify at an upcoming hearing relating to data privacy that would examine “the protection and monitoring of consumer data.”","The hearing will broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use. It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.","Grassley also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss the future of data privacy in the social media industry and how to develop “rules of the road” that encourage companies to develop tailored approaches to privacy that satisfy consumer expectations while maintaining incentives for innovation.","This is the second group to call on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. Key congressional lawmakers from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, a group that oversees the actions of companies such as Facebook and Google, requested that Zuckerberg appear before them to testify in a formal hearing recently. The chairman of the committee, Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) and the committee’s head Democrat representative, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), said in a statement:","The latest revelations regarding Facebook’s use and security of user data raises many serious consumer protection concern. After committee staff received a briefing yesterday from Facebook officials, we felt that many questions were left unanswered. Mr. Zuckerberg has stated that he would be willing to testify if he is ‘the right person.’","We believe, as CEO of Facebook, he is the right witness to provide answers to the American people. We look forward to working with Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg to determine a date and time in the near future for a hearing before this committee.","Facebook is now also facing scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC recently stated that they are investigating the social media companies internal user privacy practices. Tom Pahl, Acting Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, released a statement on their investigation saying:","The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers. Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.","When asked would he be willing to testify before Congress about Facebook’s latest scandal, Zuckerberg stated, “I’m open to doing that. We actually do this fairly regularly … There are lots of different topics that Congress needs and wants to know about, and the way that we approach it is that our responsibility is to make sure that they have access to all of the information that they need to have.” But Zuckerberg did hedge this offer by saying, “the short answer is, I’m happy to if it’s the right thing to do”","Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

He was reportedly staying at the $10,000-a-week villa with several women.","Raniere returned to Texas on Monday. He is expected to appear in court Tuesday in Fort Worth on the charges filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.","Authorities said Raniere, who is known as “Vanguard” in the organization, formed a secretive group within NXIVM that had women join a slave-master club called “Dominus Obsequious Sororium,” which translates to “Master Over the Slave Woman.”","The women — usually thin because they stuck to low-calorie diets — were allegedly brainwashed into thinking the best way to advance was to become a “slave.” Raniere coerced the women into having sex with him and doing menial chores for \"masters,\" the criminal complaint stated.","The women also partook in videotaped branding ceremonies in which they had Raniere’s initials burned into their pelvic area.","\"During the branding ceremonies, slaves were required to be fully naked, and the master would order one slave to film while the other held down the slave being branded,\" the complaint said.","The women were allegedly threatened with public humiliation if they didn’t keep the arrangement a secret. Raniere punished the women for not following orders by forcing them “to wear fake cow udders over their breasts while people called them derogatory names,\" court papers stated.","Other times, they were reportedly stuck in cages.","Raniere fled to Mexico last November after the government began interviewing potential witnesses about the cult leader’s alleged activities. The New York Times published stories of some of the women who defected from their secret sorority.","Federal authorities struggled to find Raniere for months because he used encrypted email and ditched his phone.","\"The defendant was uncooperative when immigration authorities arrived and after he was taken into custody, the women chased the car in which the defendant was being transported in their own car at high speed,\" court papers stated.","On Tuesday, federal agents raided the home of Nxivm co-founder Nancy Salzman in Oregon Trail, the Albany Times Union reported.","Raniere was promoted as a \"scientist, mathematician, philosopher, entrepreneur, educator, inventor and author\" who has \"devoted his life to studying the human psychodynamic and developing new tools for human empowerment, expression and ethics,” the group’s website says.","Raniere and Nxivm have been the subject of criticism for years, dating back to at least 2012 when the Times Union of Albany published a series of articles examining the organization and the allegations it was like a cult.","Over the years, Nxivm has attracted a following that includes Emmy Award-winning actress Allison Mack. Authorities also say Raniere has been bankrolled by Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune.","Bronfman gave millions of dollars covering expenses such as private air travel costing $65,000 per flight, court papers say.","The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Katherine Lam is a breaking and trending news digital producer for Fox News.

Read the latest.)","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.","So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.","An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.","Image","Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firm’s activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images","Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”","“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”","Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.","But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.","Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.","During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.","“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.","Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.","In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”","In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.","Image","The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images","Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.","While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.","The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.","“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”","Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”","Reading Voters’ Minds","The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.","Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.","The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.","Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.","Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.","Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.","The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.","When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.","“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.","Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.","But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.","Image","Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.","Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.","When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.","All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”","He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.","Image","An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.","Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.","“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”","Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”","An International Effort","Just as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.","The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.","But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.","In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”","In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.","Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.","Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.","Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.","Image","The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.","Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.","In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.","After the Leak","By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.","Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”","Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.","Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”","Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”","Image","Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook users’ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images","But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.","While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.","Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.","All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.","In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app.","Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports “several days ago” that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating.","Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report.","Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company’s SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake “a large scale research project in the U.S.,” but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan’s company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of Kogan’s data was used in its 2016 election work for the “avoidance of doubt.”","Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located.","The Facebook blog post, written by deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the “public prominence” of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an “unacceptable violation of trust” and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties “responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.”","Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Trump’s general-election campaign.","Trump’s campaign Saturday denied using the firm’s data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.","“The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,” the campaign said in a statement. “Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.”","Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica’s role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.","The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.","A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.","The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.","Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized. Flynn is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference after pleading guilty to a felony charge.","Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nix said Assange denied the request, which came after Assange had said publicly that he had the emails. Clinton campaign emails stolen by","Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.","Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling.","Revelations that Cambridge Analytica misused social media data could also be of interest to Mueller’s investigation. While much of the thrust of special counsel’s investigation has been tightly held, Mueller has requested that the firm turn over the emails of any employees who worked on the campaign, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last year.","Mueller is also looking at the role Wikileaks played in acquiring and making public the stolen Clinton campaign emails.","Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The social network has indeed been slow to ventilate the stench surrounding its relationship to the London-based consultancy. For many the apology by Mark Zuckerberg was too little too late. But the very fact the website’s founder has been so mealy-mouthed with his response demonstrates a real belief in the invincibility of the Facebook brand. He’s right. Advertisers may grumble but their threats of withdrawing budget are as virtuous as they are hollow. With over $9bn spent on Facebook in the last quarter advertisers are far too committed to turn back. As much a traditional media may resent it, in an age where social is king Facebook has the power over distribution.","The entanglement of Facebook in our daily lives is as strong as ever. For millennials who have grown up with the platform the question of deleting their account is the equivalent to Neo choosing between red and blue pills. Facebook is a brand like no other and it is subject to different rules. This does not mean, however, Zuckerberg cannot be unplugged from the matrix. For all their talk of social value and sharing the riches tech companies are brutal; if Zuckerberg doesn’t follow up on his vague promises of change a Steve Jobs sacking scenario will be on the cards. Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg - who can claim clean hands over the deal - has kept her head down, perhaps with a mind to take control of the reins should investors continue to rattle the cage.","Facebook will not be toppled but surely the dark world of data harvesting - and its nefarious influence of the democratic process - has been blown open? Here I’d also urge caution. To overplay the danger posed by Cambridge Analytica is to buy into its myths. The Channel 4 undercover investigation showed the true face of the company: behind the trendy veneer of behavioural insights and targeted messaging algorithms is a shady network of spooks and fixers playing dirty tricks to manipulate public opinion. Or did it just show two desperate marketing suits who’d been around the block and were massively overselling their capabilities and access to win business? Where the media seem to think they’ve found a Bond villain in Analytica CEO Alexander Nix - great name- his LinkedIn reads more like the profile of a mid-career sales exec with fantasies of global espionage. In the world of consultancy and PR such figures are common. The field is competitive and unless you’re David Axelrod the fees for advising on elections barely cover the cost of a business class flight to Addis Ababa. If Channel 4 want more revelatory content for their undercover team there are plenty of less discrete firms out there promising similar services. Most of it will be public school boy horseshit.","Analytica were different to other consultancies due only to the treasure trove of data mined by an app designed by the academic psychologist Aleksandr Kogan. The use of the tool - which asked volunteers to answer a series of questions and invited them to opt in to share their Facebook likes (and, inadvertently, those of their friends) - is nowhere near as radical as it has been made out to be, the principals of which date back in basic psychometric testing in the 19th Century. Details of how exactly this data was used in Analytica’s work for the Trump campaign have yet to emerge. Knowing whether a user likes the Colbert Report and Niki Minaj or dislikes fishing and Clint Eastwood movies can hone a message. Yet there is little evidence to suggest it is any more effective than traditional media at actually persuading people to switch allegiances or to get out and vote.","And herein lies the rub. For all the outcry over Facebook’s role in Trump’s victory there has been little self-examination by the US media of its role in giving the then-candidate’s message a prominent platform. During the primary campaign Trump received over $2bn worth of free coverage - far beyond what any of his rivals were able to garner. Despite being derided by many commenters - left and right - one study has shown that Hilary Clinton still received the most negative coverage of the election - largely due to the media’s regurgitation of the Trump team’s catchy slogans. While it is right that the important role of social media is scrutinised it is tempting to wonder if there’s not a bit of guilty conscience being shown by the liberal media that they didn’t do enough. Alas, deleting Facebook is not the same thing as deleting Trump.","Mark Borkowski is the founder of Borkowski.do. He tweets @MarkBorkowski"],"isopubdate":""}

Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F.T.C. confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0.4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week.","The F.T.C. said it planned to determine whether the social media giant had violated a consent decree it signed in 2011 to protect users’ privacy.","The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings. Each violation of the agreement, which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third-party apps, carries a penalty of up to $40,000 a day.","The agency’s acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook’s stock down as much as 6.5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered. Facebook said last week that it was anticipating an inquiry by the agency.","The F.T.C. said in a statement on Monday that it “takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.”","Lawmakers have repeatedly called for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear in hearings on Capitol Hill. Last week, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate commerce committees formally invited him to testify.","“I’m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica, and I’m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there,” Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana, said in an interview. “Facebook isn’t just a company. It is so powerful it is like a country.”","Some lawmakers, such as Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, asked the F.T.C. to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users.","“The sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree,” he said in a statement. “There is no excuse for delay.”","Cambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism, too. On Monday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group in Washington, filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law.","In an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users, The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections, despite a warning from its own election lawyer.","The employees worked on polling, message development, and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals.","The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had “strategic” or “operational” roles. But former employees contradicted that account, suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non-Americans can do for American political campaigns.","Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department, which has authority to investigate “knowing and willful” violations of campaign law. The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which has day-to-day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules.","“It defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election-related activities in U.S. elections that they did so anyway,” said Paul S. Ryan, Common Cause’s vice president for policy and litigation.","In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company’s privacy and user data policies. One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Wiretap Act) and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform.","The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users’ browsing of third-party health sites. Any site with a Facebook “like” button, including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook, according to the lawsuit.","Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook user information.","Video","In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which data from over 50 million Facebook profiles was secretly scraped and mined for voter insights, many Facebook users have decided to delete their accounts — but untangling yourself from a site like Facebook is not as easy as pressing “delete.”Published OnMarch 21, 2018","Many users have threatened to deactivate or delete their accounts to protest Facebook’s stewardship of their personal data.

Which is why the next frontier must be decentralized platforms. Platforms like Dtube and Steemit, built on blockchain, will be future of how content, the good the bad and ugly, will be stored. And the efforts to silence dissenting voices, will actually be the undoing of YouTube and Facebook.”","I disagree not with Swann’s endorsement of decentralized platforms like Dtube and Steemit (which are both excellent and essential weapons in our revolution against the establishment oppression machine), but with Swann’s assertion that the social media giants’ censorship of dissenting voices will be their undoing. It will not.","“2017 was a strong year for Facebook, but it was also a hard one,” said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month. “In 2018, we’re focused on making sure Facebook isn’t just fun to use, but also good for people’s well-being and for society. We’re doing this by encouraging meaningful connections between people rather than passive consumption of content. Already last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people’s time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.”","Two questions:(1) Does this sound like normal corporate talk to you? A corporation deliberately decreasing its advertising revenue for the benefit of “people’s well-being and society”?(2) Does anyone honestly believe that Mark Zuckerberg has ever once in his life cared about “people’s well-being and society?”","Fast Companyreports that time spent on Facebook is down a whopping 24 percent in a tone that seems to be warning that the company is in trouble, but Zuckerberg is actually publicly boasting about the loss and how beneficial it is for mankind. Not only has he drastically slashed his viewership, surely at great expense, but he’s also massively increased his overhead, hiring an extra 14,000 people to help fight “fake news”, which is expected to have risen to 20,000 by year’s end.","What kind of corporation does that? What kind of multibillion dollar corporation slashes its own profits that drastically without being legally compelled to, and does it for the good of “people’s well-being and society”?","These questions make it clear that we are looking at two possibilities here:(1) That a Silicon Valley tech plutocrat, who censors the speech of political dissidents and hoards tens of billions of dollars while the poor starve, honestly cares about “encouraging meaningful connections” and being “good for people’s well-being and society” so much that he would slash his own profits to make that happen.Or,(2) This isn’t about helping people, and it isn’t about money. This is about marginalizing dissident voices as part of Silicon Valley’s extensive and well-documented alliance with the national security state.","Millionaires think in terms of money and profit. Billionaires think in terms of power and dominance. Zuckerberg isn’t filtering non-mainstream media off of Facebook for the good of society, and he isn’t doing it for money either. He’s doing it because he is an oligarch in the borderless new empire, and it is in the empire’s interest that dissident voices be silenced.","Silicon Valley is so intertwined with the agendas of intelligence and defense agencies that it’s gone beyond being used for surveillance and propaganda, and we now see things like Google straight up building AI for the Pentagon’s drone program. In an environment wherein money translates directly into political power, it’s impossible to grow beyond a certain size without learning to collaborate with existing power structures. Defense and intelligence agencies are the biggest enforcers of existing power structures in the new empire, and they will either empower you or your competition based on how willing you are to collaborate with them.","My point with all this is that the few clear-eyed rebels are not going to kill Facebook, Youtube and Twitter by marginalizing themselves into the fragmented fringe of alternative social media outlets like Steemit, Dtube, Gab, Minds, MeWe, etc. That’s exactly what these bastards want. They want us far away from their mainstream livestock. They want us to exit into some fringe circle that they will then invent a name for and smear as the place where all the kooks go. All of a sudden you’ll see all the mass media outlets simultaneously start using that label (“fringe conspiracy sites”, “fringe media”, who knows) in a derogatory and dismissive way, and from then on their herd will be immunized from our influence.","We should absolutely be expanding into new social media platforms (MeWe is an especially pleasant and collaborative site right now due to the current absence of pro-establishment disruptors), but we need to be engaging the mainstream as well, because they will not follow us. If Facebook can absorb a 24 percent dip that it caused by its own actions, then it can absorb the far smaller group of anti-establishment activists who would exit it as well.","I know it’s intensely creepy that these Silicon Valley corporations are being used to gather information on us. I know it’s incredibly frustrating to watch them strangle our numbers further and further into marginalization. But the reason they are fighting so hard to wedge us out of their mainstream platforms is because they want us out. Saying “Okay, well if you don’t want us here, we’ll leave!” is not a punishment, it’s a reward.","We need alternative social media platforms to enable us to talk to one another, but we need mainstream social media platforms to enable us to convey information to the mainstream as well. The empire is happy to have all of its dissidents marginalized into a small fringe group that it can then paint over with smear campaigns; what jams the gears of the propaganda machine is counter-narratives being shown to mainstream westerners.","Contrary to what the ideology of libertarians like Ben Swann would lead you to conclude, this isn’t a problem that the free market can sort out, because this is not a free market. The scales are being heavily weighted toward the social media outlets which collaborate most extensively with the interests of the empire, and that is where the mainstream population is going to remain for the foreseeable future. We cannot shut them down by exiting and taking some small amount of ad revenue away from them, but we can frustrate them so much that they are forced to expose their ham-fisted totalitarianism more and more.","By taking the revolution deep into the guts of Facebook, Twitter and Youtube, we can force them to either allow us to speak or become more and more totalitarian with their censorship, until they are forced to reveal to mainstream America just what kind of beasts they really are. Either way, we’d be making it harder for them instead of doing their job for them by marginalizing ourselves.","The mainstream will not follow us if we exit mainstream platforms into tiny websites most people don’t even know exist. The average American isn’t going to say “Hmm, I’ve noticed there’s a disappointing lack of anti-imperialist ideas in my news feed, maybe I should go check out that Twitter imitation with the frog logo?” They’re going to stay right where the propagandists want them. So since we can’t pull them out, we’ve got to go in after them.","Noam Chomsky said that the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum, and that’s exactly what the propagandists are engineering with their censorship practices on Facebook, Twitter, and Google/Youtube. The only thing on the menu in cable news is an extremely heated ongoing debate ranging from the corporatist Orwellian warmongering neoliberalism of MSNBC to the corporatist Orwellian warmongering neoliberalism of Fox News, and they want that debate to be happening on mainstream online discourse as well.","As long as we refuse to leave mainstream social media circles, it’s like they’ve got Rachel Maddow and Sean Hannity telling everyone what to think, and a bunch of fiery-eyed rebels keep storming the studio and kicking over their desks.","Stay where they don’t want us to the extent that you are capable, please. If you’ve left, go back in. Go back in and shine as bright as you can, attracting as many followers as possible and telling as much truth as you can get away with. Don’t leave until they drag you out kicking and screaming."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

It said on Saturday: \"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"","Also, Kogan could have broken Facebook's own rules by using the data for commercial rather than strictly academic purposes.","Does this change Facebook and CA's previous testimonies?","The latest revelations also suggest that Facebook and Cambridge Analytica both misled lawmakers about their actions.","Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica, previously denied working with Kogan as well as using Facebook data. \"We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data,\" Nix told British MPs last month, as cited by The Observer.","Facebook has also denied that it gave Cambridge Analytica data.","Simon Milner, the company's UK director of policy, told British MPs last month: \"They [Cambridge Analytica] may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.\"","Facebook has since suspended Cambridge Analytica, its parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories, and Wylie from its platform. Wylie was also suspended from WhatsApp and Instagram, which are both owned by Facebook, The Observer's Carole Cadwalladr reported.","Is Russia involved?","Possibly. Wylie's testimony has revealed a Russian connection to Cambridge Analytica and Kogan.","The company was interested in understanding the link between data, behavioural microtargeting, and political campaigns, and met Cambridge Analytica at least three times between 2014 and 2015, The New York Times reported.","Wylie told The Obsever: \"It didn't make any sense to me... Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?\"","Kogan, the Cambridge academic, had also been an associate professor at St Petersburg State University and received Russian government grants while creating and harvesting Facebook data through the app, The Observer reported.","Curiously, Kogan's work in Russia was never publicised, and colleagues told The Observer \"no one knew\" about it. Cambridge University said it was carried out in a \"private capacity.\"","Damian Collins, who chairs Britain's DCMS committee, said of Facebook on Sunday:","\"The reputation of this company is being damaged by stealth, because of their constant failure to respond with clarity and authority to the questions of genuine public interest that are being directed to them.","\"Someone has to take responsibility for this. It's time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.\""],"isopubdate":"2018-03-19"}

On its board sat Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart chief and far-right ringleader who later oversaw Trump’s campaign and briefly served as the president’s chief strategist. Cambridge Analytica secured contracts for US elections that were served by the UK-based SCL, despite the possibility that its use of data scientists with foreign citizenship was a violation of campaign finance laws. (It also is being investigated for its possible involvement in the UK’s Brexit referendum.)","Advertisement","Mercer wanted results, per the Times’ report, and SCL’s election division hired Cambridge University’s Dr. Aleksandr Kogan to provide psychometric data that could be used for targeted advertising. Kogan created an app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” that was legitimately downloaded some 270,000 times, but the paper wrote Kogan actually managed to provide the “raw profiles” of approximately 50 million users whose data was supposed to be used only for the purposes of improving the app’s user experience. The Times added that “roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles.”","(Though Kogan is a Cambridge professor, the university is not affiliated with the analytics company nor was he allegedly acting on its behalf when designing the app.)","Though it’s unclear how that data was used in the 2016 elections, Vox noted that Trump’s digital operation was “shockingly effective,” running thousands of variants of online ads to help “determine which messages were resonating where and then shape Trump’s travel schedule around it.”","Advertisement","“We’ve rolled out a long-form quantitative instrument to probe the underlying traits that inform personality,” Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix said in a 2016 speech. “If you know the personality of the people you’re targeting, you can nuance your messaging to resonate more effectively with those key groups.”","In a blog post, Facebook VP Paul Grewal explained that the social media site had learned of the improperly obtained data and ordered SCL, Cambridge Analytica, affiliated staff, and Kogan to delete it in 2015. Now, Grewal wrote, Facebook believes that these parties lied about whether they still have the millions of profiles and have opted to suspend them pending the outcome of an investigation.","Advertisement","However, it’s not clear that Facebook did all it could to verify the data was not still floating around out there earlier. Former Cambridge Analytica data scientist Christopher Wylie told the Observer that Facebook never aggressively followed up to ensure the data was actually deleted, and only required them to “tick a box on a form and post it back.”","According to CNN, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said that it contracted with Kogan for a project in 2014 but that it had deleted the data when it became clear it was improperly obtained. The spokesperson added, “No data from [Kogan’s firm Global Science Research] was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”","But something shady seems to be going on. The Times reported that “a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.”","Advertisement","As the Wall Street Journal noted last year, Cambridge Analytica’s role in Trump’s campaign drew the scrutiny of special counsel Robert Mueller, the Department of Justice investigator looking into the alleged Russian plot to meddle in the 2016 elections. As the Washington Post added, disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn also disclosed an “advisory role” at the company, which Cambridge Analytica denies was ever actually implemented. Nix, the CEO, also disclosed last year that he had reached out to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in an attempt to secure leaked Hillary Clinton campaign emails allegedly stolen by Russian hackers, though he said he was rebuffed.","Update 3/18/2018 at 7:05pm ET: It looks like the fallout from this situation is beginning to settle over Facebook, which is facing renewed inquiries about why it did not act faster to certify whether the data was destroyed. Per CNN, Facebook also admitted that it is looking into “ties” between current Facebook researcher Joseph Chancellor and Kogan’s firm, GSR, which was dissolved in 2017. It’s unclear at this point what role, if any, Chancellor had in improperly obtaining the data on tens of millions of Facebook users, though Chancellor was reportedly listed on paperwork as one of GSR’s directors.","Advertisement","Some former federal officials have also begun talking about whether Facebook’s lack of control over the data constituted a violation of a 2011 Federal Trade Commission consent decree with Facebook that its users must explicitly give consent before their data is shared, per the Washington Post. The paper reported that damages could in theory go up to $40,000 per violation, which if applied to all 50 million individuals allegedly impacted would mean Facebook’s “possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars.” (In practice, this is unrealistic, but any penalty assessed could still be very large.) The incident may also indicate that such violations of the FTC rulings were commonly ignored as part of Facebook’s business model, which could backfire big time for the social media giant.","Finally, Facebook is coming under additional fire for its decision to suspend data analyst Christopher Wylie’s account. Wylie worked for Cambridge Analytica during the period that the data was allegedly obtained, but has characterized his involvement in the ongoing revelations about the company’s conduct as whistle-blowing.","Advertisement","Yet the intrigue doesn’t end there. Per the Financial Times, Cambridge Analytica’s damage control efforts have included attempts to halt a Channel 4 interview between Nix and undercover reporters in which the CEO “talks unguardedly about its practices.”"],"isopubdate":"2018-03-17"}

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration","Facebook did not immediately reply when asked on Sunday for a response to the lawmakers’ comments. However, in a new statement Sunday, the company said it was conducting a “comprehensive internal and external review” to determine if the user data in question still existed.","Cambridge Analytica and the professor have denied violating Facebook’s terms, according to media reports.","The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which was already under attack over Russians’ use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U.S. elections.","Republican Senator Jeff Flake said he had a lot of questions about the data taken from Facebook, including who knew it had been taken and whether it is still being used.","Slideshow (3 Images)","“This is a big deal, when you have that amount of data, and the privacy violations there are significant,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union” program. “So the question is who knew it and when did they know it, how long did this go on and what happens to that data now.”","Facebook faced new calls for regulation from Democratic senators on Saturday and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards, but it was unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress would act.","U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said more investigation was needed.","“We need to find out what we can about the misappropriation of the privacy, the private information of tens of millions of Americans,” he said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”","Also on ABC, Senator James Lankford, a Republican, said it was not known whether the incident was connected to the Trump campaign."],"isopubdate":"2018-03-18"}
